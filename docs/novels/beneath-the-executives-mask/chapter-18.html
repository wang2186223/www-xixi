                <p>I tried matching his steps so that I didn&#39;t get hurt by the walls as everything was black and dark for me. Suddenly, when we were done climbing the stairs, he grasped me by my back. &#34;Stay still&#34;, he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and did everything as instructed by him. I was threatened by Mr. Reynolds&#39;s warning, my mind always revolved around him, even when I didn&#39;t want his thoughts to strike. Maybe, he was controlling my mind, or maybe I was just carried away to his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James unfolded the handkerchief from my eyes. I rubbed my eyes before opening it as the cloth had some kind of grip that darkened my sight for a while. It took not more than 10 seconds for everything to turn normal. I turned around and realized that we were on the terrace of this building. It was surrounded by darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So we are here to see the darkness &#34;, I raised my brows arrogantly just like Mr. Reynolds did and turned towards James.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, baby girl&#34;, he positioned my head towards the sky and it was the most exotic view I had ever seen in my life. The stars shined bright and twinkled around the moon. It felt that it was controlled by someone who had the power to shut them off and turn them on. The view was breathtaking, in our busy life we forget to feel the nature and appreciate how beautiful it actually is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the most beautiful thing ever&#34;, I interrupted the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not really&#34;, he disagreed with my statement. I had a puzzled expression on my face, he felt it so he continued &#34;You are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen&#34;, he pecked me on my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled a bit but didn&#39;t blush because I didn&#39;t felt anything for him but the moment he created for me was overwhelming enough to melt me down. He intertwined his fingers with me. We just kept silent for a while and observed the stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, he pushed me closer to him from my back, I got pulled away, because I had less strength comparatively than him, but I knew that he wouldn&#39;t do anything wrong. He looked at me straight in my eyes. I tried looking in his eyes but kept diverting my focus because it was creating a sensuous moment for both of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He positioned my face towards him through my chin through his thumb and pointer finger.&#34;James &#34;, I immediately responded to him.&#34;Shush &#34;, he placed his finger on my lips and pulled me closer, my body touched his and the situation turned intimate. He kept traveling his hands from my waist to my butt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Always live upon the moments &#34;, was Francis&#39;s famous line which echoed in my head so I didn&#39;t push him away. I just stayed still and didn&#39;t try moving much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James looked at my lips and within few moments pounced on it. I couldn&#39;t synchronize much as I didn&#39;t feel the comfort but I sure tried kissing him back. He slowly and gently sucked up my lower lip and then turned towards the upper one. I caught him tightly from his neck and eventually started messing with the back portion of his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved his hands from my shoulders and got a grip of the blouse I was wearing, he tried to pull it out but it sort of uncomforted me so I pushed him away so hard that he was about to fall on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34;, I tried to make up for my childish behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay &#34;, his face denoted his disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m really sorry but I guess I cannot do this&#34;, I looked away from him and started walking towards the party again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey-hey-hey baby girl, it is okay!&#34; he tried comforting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both left the awesome view and marched towards the party again. I looked at him and blushed a bit. I wanted to text Gina and Francis but I had left my phone in the room so I couldn&#39;t. James intertwined his fingers with mine giving it a romantic and cute look. Our kiss was continuously playing in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where were you, both of you? we are leaving within an hour&#34;, Mr. Reynolds came towards us when we finally reached the party hall. He had a glass of beer in his hand. He observed me from top to bottom, maybe he had figured out things from my condition. My hair had turned messy, so I tried parting up the strands behind my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Reynolds &#34;, a voice called him from behind so he turned away and went towards the person who was calling him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An old man came towards us and hugged James, he hugged him back. &#34;It&#39;s been a long time, my son &#34;, he caressed his back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just few months Uncle Henry!&#34; he parted away. They looked quite familiar with each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old man coughed continuously and when he felt comfortable, he asked&#34;isn&#39;t that girl with you now? What was her name &#34;he thought for a while and continued &#34;Samarrah, such a sweet girl&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was completely shocked as now everything made sense to me. The letter &#39;J&#39; now made sense. He was such a man-whore. I felt like stabbing him innumerable times in his chest but I controlled. I acted like I didn&#39;t know anything about Samarrah because if I reacted it would be impossible for me to spill out the beans. Yeah, our last names were the same but there are a lot many people who have the same last name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We broke up &#34;, he looked towards me, sighed, and continued talking with the old man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, how are you?&#34; James cut the topic and very cleverly started talking about something else. I side cornered myself from them as the presence of James around me was exhausting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went towards Mr. Reynolds and stood next to him. My mind was constantly revolving around too many topics and things that went wrong tonight. I wish I didn&#39;t kiss him back and pushed him the moment he came close to me. I wanted to commit suicide because everything just felt so wrong. I kissed a man who had made my sister pregnant and left her halfway. I hated James so much, every ounce of my feelings which started developing for him were shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate myself and my idiotic nature &#34;, I murmured under my breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you say something Miss Waters?&#34; he questioned me and my eyes started to turn watery. I looked at him and escaped by gaze away from him, turned around, and replied &#34;nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You, Okay ?&#34; he turned me around. He wasn&#39;t that bad of a person, he may have been a bit aggressive and bossy but he was never a man-whore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t answer him, I just hugged him. I didn&#39;t know that whatever I was doing was right or wrong but I couldn&#39;t think about anything else at that moment. He didn&#39;t hug me back. I didn&#39;t expect him to do it either. His chest felt like home, I let go of him slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry &#34;, I apologized with my head down in shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come, let&#39;s go &#34;, he ordered me to leave this place along with him before the actual time.&#34;Stay here for a while &#34;, he ordered me again so I took a halt, till that moment he went towards the mayor and greeted him goodbye, I took my belongings from the room after he did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We waited for the driver but when Mr. Reynolds contacted him, he said that it&#39;ll take him approximately 30 minutes to be there. We waited for a while outside the car but Mr. Reynolds decided to drive the car by himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leaving so soon &#34;, a voice came towards us and when I turned around I got angrier, as it was James, but I acted normal and formal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34;, Mr. Reynolds answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you come with me Amanda?&#34; he looked towards me. I didn&#39;t know how to answer his question so I kept quiet for some seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s going with me&#34;, Mr. Reynolds told James his final decision. I was so thankful to this man. I acted like I hated him, but no. I didn&#39;t, because, at the end of the day, I always had misconceptions against him. He always confused me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the passenger seat and comforted myself with the seat belt.&#34;Come with the driver and don&#39;t drink too much&#34;, Mr. Reynolds instructed James to which he replied &#34;Of course bro&#34; and hugged him warmly. James was a creepy pervert, I now realized, and he had to pay for whatever he had done to my sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was not going to leave him so easily but I needed evidence to prove that to Mr. Reynolds. I closed my eyes whilst settling my head on the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I felt a shake on my shoulder, I opened my eyes and realized that it was Mr. Reynolds. It felt like a dream, &#34;Let me sleeeeeeeeeeeeep&#34;, I said in a low tone exaggerating the word e.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On your bed, in your house&#34;, he shook me again and continued &#34;not in my car&#34;. I pinched myself to confirm that I wasn&#39;t dreaming and soon realized it. Mr. Reynolds opened the car door as he made way for me to exit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you&#34;, I said in a sleepy drunk tone and walked crookedly towards the front door of my house.</p>
