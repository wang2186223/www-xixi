                <p>AMANDA&#39;S POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled over the car at the nearest corner, I saw vehicles around which clearly meant that we were now in some city. I could make that out from the hustle and bustle of people. I went closer to Mr. Reynolds to examine his breathes, Thank God they were normal! A bit slow from usual but was satisfactory enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey ! can you instruct me the directions to the nearest hospital ?&#34;, I opened the door and asked the local vendor who had a small stall of first copy bags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take a right turn and then keep moving straight. You&#39;ll see a big board there, that&#39;s your destination. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, Have a good day &#34;, I greeted him and rushed towards the car. Mr. Reynolds did no move, he rested his head on the seat carelessly. I turned the keys in its hole and started the car. I went as per directions given to me by the man, I took turns carefully avoiding any minor accidents which could cause any mishaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as my vehicle was coming to a stop, I eased the pressure off my brakes while maintaining the pressure on the clutch to avoid a sudden jerky stop, but to my disturbance, my car didn&#39;t stop. I tried pressuring hard on the clutch but there was no result. I was agitated by the situation as I didn&#39;t have Mr. Reynolds by my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept adjusting the steering as per the vacancy of the road. Within moments we reached the hospital, my car broke through the gate and paved its way by self as people started to run away out of fear. The front glass shattered into pieces, some even rested on my skin which caused small bruises all over the exposed areas of my body including my face. I took a firm grip of the steering ensuring to prevent the car from traveling into some indistinct place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On twirling my eyeballs I realized that I now came close to the enormously large hospital&#39;s gate, there was a huge tree ahead next to it so I pushed the wheel towards it and as a result, bumped ourselves into it. My head got stuck with the steering, I cornered my eyes to look at Mr. Reynolds, he was unaffected by the firm grip of the seat belt. I looked at him for a while until my vision blurred and I was surrounded by darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch! It&#39;s hurting me &#34;, I slowly opened my eyes and realized that there was a big syringe connected to my arm, acquainted by a pipe which supplied me blood through it. &#34;Oh My God, do I lack blood ?&#34;, I questioned myself suddenly gaining consciousness about what happened previously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the pressure of the bandages over my skin, almost every place across my forehead and hands. I tried to free myself but the syringe kept me glued on the bed so I decided to deject them from my body at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is the man I was stuck with ?&#34;, I realized after gaining consciousness about Mr. Reynolds. I tried plucking out the injection which was fitted deep within my skin but I failed miserably. Various negative thoughts rotated across my mind regarding Mr. Reynolds, the only three words I was interested in hearing at this very moment was &#39;he is fine&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is he ?&#34;, I questioned the nurse who looked away &#34;Goddamn, tell me where the fuck he is?&#34;, I loathed re-questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;H-he i-is &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop stammering and clear your tone at this very moment &#34;, I shrieked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s in the ICU, fighting his battle against death &#34;, her tone was slow and low. Her gaze didn&#39;t meet mine, she looked around whilst keeping up the conversation &#34;So sorry, I was warned not to speak out your husband&#39;s condition to you &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I pay him a visit &#34;, I completely ignored the fact that she just paired us into a couple. All I wanted to do was see him, my mind was completely redirected towards him. A tear rolled through my cheek which made me realize that I was sobbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She removed my medicines from the drawer close by ignoring my desire to meet him .&#34;Guess what? I&#39;m gonna pay him a visit anyway &#34;, I yanked the tube from my hand avoiding the pain which it caused me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please stay calm, you&#39;re supposed to rest &#34;, I grabbed the knife which was placed on the table so as to threaten the nurse to maintain a safe distance away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing and no one will stop me or I&#39;ll cut my veins. Stay away, don&#39;t call the doctor. I am fine, I&#39;ll certainly be &#34;, I buttoned the hospital&#39;s loose shirt which I was wearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll come along, please don&#39;t go alone. Let me be your guide please &#34;, she wasn&#39;t angry at me but instead served me her help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and marched out of the room crookedly, she held my hands providing me moral and physical support as my vision was blurred due to the formation of tears under my waterline. &#34;That room is the emergency room &#34;, she pointed towards the ICU which was situated on the corner of the floor. The hospital was massive, clean, and well built.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a small glass on the door which allowed us to see through the room, I fastened up my walking position because of which my leg twisted resulting me to fall, I sheltered myself through my palms by resting them on the ICU&#39;S door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abandoning my pain I looked through the glass, Mr. Reynolds was on the bed surrounded by 3-doctors. He laid there effortlessly with his eyes closed. I could see the doctors cleaning up his wounds and inserting various machines in his body to speed up the recovery process, science was out of my comfort zone so I didn&#39;t really understand what they were doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been an hour madam &#34;, I felt a pat on my shoulder. The nurse tried to alarm me so that I could now move away and rest for myself. &#34;It&#39;s my fault, do you see his condition &#34;, I wailed loudly whilst hugging her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shush, it&#39;s fate. It&#39;s all destined. He&#39;ll be fine if it&#39;s in his destiny, no sobbing only praying &#34;, she hugged me back as she patted my back softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want him back &#34;, I cried even harder this time cursing myself because if he wouldn&#39;t have come safeguarding me, something like this wouldn&#39;t ever happen to him .&#34;I should&#39;ve been in his place &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything happens for a reason, love &#34;, the nurse sure was quite optimistic. She dragged me towards the closest seat which bypassed the room. I looked straight towards the ground lost in my thoughts hoping for positive news. I clenched my fists and rested my cheeks over them waiting for the arrival of the doctors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the doctor opened the door I ran towards him &#34; How is he, tell me ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He, umm &#34; he paused for a while and then continued after clearing his throat &#34; We&#39;ve got 24 hours to diagnose that, follow me to my cabin &#34;, he wanted to talk in private because revealing anything regarding his disease and condition was confidential and against the rules of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed him to his cabin as he took the lead, I avoided making any sound of my footsteps. The word &#39;disease&#39; echoed around my ears over and over again. I kept sane and positive just like the nurse suggested to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take a seat, Mrs Reynolds, do you want some beverage or plain water ?&#34;, he was gentle enough to understand my condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine, thanks &#34;, my mind revolved around the word &#39;Mrs&#39; but I didn&#39;t really clear his misunderstanding as he&#39;d tell me every minute detail of his condition if he considered me his spouse and if he happened to know our relation he wouldn&#39;t spill out any beans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So how long will it take for him to recover &#34;, I took a seat whilst furrowing my brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Reynolds, he is currently in an extremely critical situation. We have 24 hours to figure out that whether his body will respond to our treatment or &#34; I swallowed deep out of stress &#34; Or I think you&#39;re smart enough to figure out the consequences, keep him in your prayers as he is in need of them &#34;, I quickly wiped the tears which were enrolling through my eyes. &#34;Call all of your family members, the ones which are precisely close to him &#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I pay him a visit?&#34; I asked hesitantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more thing, you can examine his pulse through the electrocardiogram. Its currently moving slowly, there&#39;s a small check of the beats down. The moment you see any movement, whether a rise or fall, press the bell on the right-hand corner of the patient&#39;s bed. It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t have nurses for taking up this responsibility but since you&#39;re his wife I&#39;ll assume that you may want to spend the remaining hours of his life with him .&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remaining ?&#34;, I questioned startled no matter how much I wanted to punch him on his face for uttering that word out of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry, there&#39;s yet a 20% chance for his recovery. So sorry &#34;, he stated the obvious.</p>
