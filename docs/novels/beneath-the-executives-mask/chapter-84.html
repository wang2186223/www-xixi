                <p>Amanda&#39;s Pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sauntering around the campus , I noticed that guys and girls were looking at me , staring precisely. Was I walking with the dead ? Or maybe with some supernatural creature . Mr Reynolds didn&#39;t seem to care , he walked by my side leisurely without giving a flying fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chin tilted up just like his brown hair. His suit, tie and pants definitely didn&#39;t suit the college atmosphere but he was unaffected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also fake smiled at some of the girls around sarcastically. One thing I noted was, they didn&#39;t eye me. They only gawked at Mr Reynolds&#39;s direction . &#34;If you wanted to come with me, you should&#39;ve atleast picked up a college-going-casual-outfit &#34;, I leaned closer to him and murmured in a low tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whats wrong with this ?&#34;, he arched his brows .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Turn around for a while, maybe you&#39;ll find an answer &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe my ethereal face blew their minds, maybe &#34;, he winked sexily as he walked stiffly resting his hands into his pockets. Maybe, he was right. Maybe it was his personality and face, not his outfit. I shouldn&#39;t care, I should give no fucks at all .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Subsequently spotting Gina and Francis, we engulfed ourselves into a group hug which was our little tradition. Gina dramatically cleared her throat when she spotted Mr Reynolds. Francis went closer to him and shook his hands . &#34;Hey there, Mr Reynolds &#34;, Gina sounded fresh, lively and okay today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good Morning, Miss Gina &#34;, he gestured her with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my hand on Gina&#39;s shoulder and pleaded for help ,&#34;I literally don&#39;t know anything. Train me &#34;, she smiled solacing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On your service Ma&#39;am &#34;, she chuckled and continued &#34;Since it&#39;s a group presentation, you can present the first two slides which mostly deals with the introduction &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed the notes from her hands and started learning my part loudly. I was a loud learner, I couldn&#39;t memorize anything silently .&#34;What&#39;s France&#39;s part ?&#34;, I questioned Gina looking at Francis who stood by Mr Reynolds&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s going to say the last three slides. He has his palm&#39;s inked, don&#39;t worry&#34;, Francis showed me his palms which were filled with notes . Mr Reynolds peeped at it, his face was plastered with amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We headed towards the ground-floor&#39;s canteen, it was yet 30 minutes till the lecture. I glanced at Mr Reynolds, he was doing something on his phone. He neither looked at us, nor anyone around. He took the corner-most chair of our table. I lifted my ass up to order something, I was hungry .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Aaron, you&#39;d like some coffee? &#34;,Francis questioned him .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He drinks tea &#34;, I interrupted and later cursed my blunt nature. His eyes met mine as he chuckled , I quickly turned my face and body towards the ordering counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I traveled my eye-balls towards the menu, we always ordered our signature sandwich but when it came to deserts, we always experimented.I suddenly felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around to meet eyes with that person .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Susan &#34;, I greeted her . She was the most fake, dumb, attention-hungry girl of our college.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Long time no see&#34;, she pulled me into a hug , I could smell her cologne. It&#39;s smell was enchanting but on her body I felt like ranting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at me, my outfit. Her gang did the same, they also turned their attention towards Mr Reynolds whilst talking to me. I cringed for a moment, was it jealousy ?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So he&#39;s that hottie you&#39;ve been spending your nights and days with &#34;, she grinned like an idiot as she stretched the word &#39;night&#39;. Her group-mates repeated the sentence. I pouted in annoyance .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, that&#39;s not true &#34;, I objected lying. She didn&#39;t seem much convinced with my answer, she quickly unlocked her phone, typed something and propelled it towards my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I peeped in, I was more than shocked on reading the e-news. It read &#39;The mystery girl found comfort in Reynolds&#39;s mansion . Who is she ? The girlfriend? The mistress? The fiance ? The escort? &#39;, it also had a paragraph which followed the headline. I knew that these were only the perks of staying with the billionaire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t narrate the real reason to Susan, she&#39;ll make a scene out of it. I , also couldn&#39;t agree to this fake shit. I was lost in a maze which had no exit out so I decided to be a runner of this whole situation. I collected my tray and tried ignoring her group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me &#34;, Susan marched towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About what ? Have a life bitch &#34;, I cursed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved her fingers through my face, she made way towards my neck slowly. Such a bully ,&#34;so what do you really do to please that rich man? Give him blow-jobs? Surrender yourself roughly on the bed? Tell me baby, don&#39;t hide things from your friends. Let them have a share of his richness too &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me &#34;, I raised my voice in annoyance as she was raging my anger . How cheap was her thought. I saw Gina coming towards me through cornered eyes. I had to sort this before she arrives, Gina was the violent kind of a girl. She couldn&#39;t bare anyone&#39;s nuisance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck yourself and your jealousy filled tits&#34;, I turned my head away and marched towards our table. Not much to my surprise, everyone present were looking at me. I silently kept the food-tray on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After passing Mr Reynolds&#39;s tea in his direction, I took a bite of my sandwich. He didn&#39;t really show any interest in my fight with Susan but one thing was sorted, I was going to have a word with him about it the moment we exit the college premises. I didn&#39;t initiate the topic here because it was chaotic and I didn&#39;t really want to add flames to the fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On completing the meal, I revised my slide one last time and stood up ,&#34;I&#39;ll be waiting for you&#34;, Mr Reynolds looked at his watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t inviting you with me either. I&#39;ll be back in an hour &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See you Amanda Waters &#34;, I turned around as I walked besides Gina &#34;Wait&#34;, he called from behind, I turned my head in his direction and arched my brows waiting for him to complete his statement so that I could rush towards my classroom &#34;All the best &#34;, he nodded his head and smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t one of those gleaming smiles, but it solaced my heart and mind. Damn you, Richie Rich.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gina eyed me so I tightened my lips and pretended to straighten up my dress . &#34;That face eh &#34;, I turned my selfie-camera on to have a glimpse of myself .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing weird I can sense &#34;, I objected . I, later realized what she meant, &#34;Oh, no it&#39;s very complicated. Don&#39;t take it that way please &#34;, I narrated her the whole story whilst waiting for ma&#39;am . She was shocked and also confused .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Francis didn&#39;t dare interrupt any of us. After ma&#39;am arrived, we patiently waited for our turn and when it truly was, we tried giving our best. Gina was our backbone whenever it came to projects, assignments and presentations. We all have someone in our group who takes care of all the studios matters, right ?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Gina &#34;, Andrew came closer to us,&#34;Hey Amanda &#34;, he later wished me. He didn&#39;t wish Francis, I looked at his face and I knew exactly how cornered he felt. I couldn&#39;t laugh on his face so I turned around silently, he pinched me softly on my shoulder as he caught me making fun of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held back till his shadow disappeared and then continued &#34;What&#39;s up with his blush man ?&#34;</p>
