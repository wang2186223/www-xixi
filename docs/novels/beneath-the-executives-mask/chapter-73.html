                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made sure to avoid any eye contact with him whilst he drove the car . Moments before someone among us may have died , he was savage , once again . When he was busy driving , I cornered my eyes to gawk at him secretly , he looked ethereal .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His small lock of hair settled on his forehead , a blush escaped my lips , I looked the other way round at the window . To my amazement , a rhythm hit my ears . I analyzed the tone and realized that Mr Reynolds turned on the radio . One of my favorite songs was playing on the radio .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my Hunter Hayes &#34;, I stretched my lips humming to the tune . It was &#39;wanted&#39; , it had been my favorite song ever since I have heard it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanna call you mine , wanna hold your hand forever &#34;, I sang matching voices with Hayes , Mr Reynolds turned his head in my direction and chuckled . If I couldn&#39;t say the words loud , I made sure to sing them to the guy who was dumb enough to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a feeling that my tire&#39;s gonna puncture &#34;, he smirked focusing his attention on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me &#34;, I pouted and then laughed . He didn&#39;t reciprocate the laughter but smiled instead . The view was fifty shades of sexy . Now , I didn&#39;t even try to pour my heart out because maybe destiny didn&#39;t want me to . I gave it a shot earlier but it was nothing but trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed my body in his direction &#34;So, do you sing ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;never &#34;, his answer was a bit too obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh come on Mr Reynolds , start getting out of your stereotypical black life . There&#39;s colors everywhere around , you just have to see them , observe them and feel them . &#34;, okay , I did sound like some sort of counselor .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you see around , out of these windows or through the front-glass ?&#34;, he interrogated .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darkness &#34;, I answered &#34;Well, you can&#39;t trick me . It has to be black and dark , considering the fact that it&#39;s night &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly , there&#39;s always darkness after light . &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take it the other way around , there&#39;s always light after darkness . Try optimism rather then pessimism &#34;, I objected .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me for a while then answered &#34;Darkness dominates the light all the time , that&#39;s why we have eclipses right ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t at least speak geography to me &#34;, I chortled at his answer . He kept his hands on the steering and ignored my question . &#34;Hey , I never really got an opportunity to tell this to you &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He arched his brows &#34;Tell what ?&#34;, he questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;thank you , thank you for always saving me and safeguarding me . I would&#39;ve been dead by now if you weren&#39;t around . I know I am an idiot , I also am well aware of my clumsy nature . I can&#39;t thank you enough for having my back . &#34;, I gave him a smile when we had an eye contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled over the car and halted next to some vacant bridge , his attention was on me . &#34; I-I &#34;,he stammered while he talk &#34;You don&#39;t have to thank me , I owe you &#34;, he paused &#34;even if it causes my life,I&#39;ll save you&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tucked away the lock of my hair behind my ear &#34;When were you this dramatic last time? &#34;, I half smiled as I spoke the words . I didn&#39;t feel scared or shy to speak to him anymore . The atmosphere was now light . He exited the car , I followed him on his way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rubbed my shoulders when the cold breezes touch my naked skin. We were on a small bridge , our car parked in one corner of it . I kept my hand on the wall&#39;s ceiling ,trying to look down . Moon&#39;s light contacted the river making the reflection alluring .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So beautiful , have you been here before ?&#34;, his arms touched mine as he gazed at the river along with me . There were no streetlights around , we could see each other through the luminosity of the moon .I was having the moment of my life, I didn&#39;t really want it to end ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t part away , he curled his hand around my shoulder pulling me close &#34;I do , I have been here &#34;, he looked up in the sky , not once towards me .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for showing me this place then &#34;, I inhaled the fresh cool air . His hands were warm , warm enough to send tickles through my spine. I interlocked my eyes with his whilst having a contact , none of us broke the connection . We just gazed in silence at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His proximity towards me did wonders . Slowly and steadily , he started coming close to me . I didn&#39;t pull away but went with the flow. Our foreheads touched , so did our nose . I could feel him breathing . I bit my lower lip hysterically .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet staring in his dark blue eyes ,I found peace . Just one moment with him could make me forget about James , about the trouble he intend to cause me . I didn&#39;t need to worry because I had my knight in shining armor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped when he smoothly pushed away my hair from my forehead and made space for his lips to touch it .He placed a small peck on my forehead and kissed it again after a minute. I tried to control my blush but I couldn&#39;t , I just couldn&#39;t .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to talk to you &#34;, he finally broke the silence but didn&#39;t distant himself , I really didn&#39;t want him to. He locked himself in that position and curled his hands around my waist. His nose touched mine, our breaths collided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he feeling the same thing , does he loves me too ? If he&#39;s not confessing his love then what&#39;s it about ? Stop being such a mystery Mr Reynolds , let me unfold you -step by step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you&#39;ve to be a pretty calm listener &#34;, he took a deep breadth, I nodded to his sentence. &#34;So , probably I&#39;ve to ask you something and confess you the other thing . What first ?&#34;, he arched his brows towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sensed the seriousness in his tone and answered &#34;Maybe , you should speak up in the chronological order you just said. Don&#39;t worry , I won&#39;t judge &#34;, I winked solacing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I, uh-- I &#34;, he stammered &#34;I guess you will &#34;, he sighed . &#34;Can you move in with me , please ?&#39;, he questioned dissolving confusion in the atmosphere around. I raised my eye brows in confusion , &#34;Look , Miss Waters . I just want to ensure myself that your safe and sound. I guess that won&#39;t be possible at your root house. You&#39;re safe in there , with me in my mansion , I hope for a yes &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why----? , I um. All of a sudden ? I&#39;ll try being safe. I can&#39;t just stay with you &#34;, I offended distancing myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Staying together doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;ve to share the same room, not that I object to that. You&#39;ll have your own liberty there , separate room , precisely. We can think about a plan to destroy James in the mean time. You just have to stay there for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long does a while last ?, I stretched out the word while in my sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. Shouldn&#39;t be long , won&#39;t be long &#34;, he shrugged .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay &#34;, I awoke the Hazel Grace within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay &#34;, he repeated , a smile took birth on his lips.</p>
