                <p>The floor was a bit crowded so I couldn&#39;t dance comfortably and as a result, my body was restricted to a certain area. I decided to completely avoid Mr. Reynolds. I turned my attention towards him, he kept himself busy with the bottle of Bacardi and his phone. I playfully hit my head and turned in the opposite direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a push on my body again, I decided to push back this time so I tilted my chin up in order to have a view of the muscular person who was shoving me again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me &#34;, I tried pushing him while I danced. He didn&#39;t move, not even an inch. He tightly caught me by my wrist and yanked me away from the dance floor, towards the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was tall, muscular, and had great height. His face was tanned, his black eyes were scary as he gazed towards me. &#34;Get the fuck off &#34;, I screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding me tightly by my shoulders he pushed me towards the wall. We were close to the parking area, the place was quite vacant which set me off in fear and trepidation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you &#34;, I shrieked as I was totally unaware of the massive figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s your cash &#34;, I cornered my eyes as I sensed a familiar voice. My eyes widened in fear as I gasped on spotting James. He threw a signed cheque on the man&#39;s face. The man took a glimpse of it and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James had his focus on this man, taking advantage of this situation I took a step away. To my oblivion, he roughly pulled me closer to him through my waist. My heart almost plummeted on the floor and I gasped again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;le-let m-me go &#34;, I stammered as I formed the sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I brought you this close to me &#34;, I could feel his breath when he kissed my neck &#34;And now I should let you go ?&#34;, he raised his brows whilst chortling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please&#34;, I pinched him on his hand as an attempt to bail myself. He turned aggressively facing him, I swallowed while I looked at him in perturbation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His proximity towards me scared the shit out of me. My hands shivered as I pushed him away. On kissing the tip of my nose, he smirked. I rubbed his touch on my nose with my shoulders. My hands shivered when I pushed him away, as gravity pulled me closer again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Reynolds, where are you ?&#34;, I shrieked as I turned my head from left to right searching for him. To my disappointment, there was no one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No he&#39;s not coming for you this time &#34;, he tightened his grip over my arms. He mischievously smiled &#34;Aw poor baby, I warned you though &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to kill me ?&#34;, I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not so soon, I want you to die a slow painful death with your Mr. Reynolds &#34;, he laughed as he removed his pocket knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gawked at him as he started moving it over the naked skin on my neck, I cornered my eyes to places where his knife moved. He didn&#39;t insert any force on it, he was clearly scaring me. And suddenly he ripped off the sleeves of my dress through the knife and injected the knife in my shoulders on the naked area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yelled when I couldn&#39;t take the pain any longer. I could see the blood sinking in my dress. It hurt, it hurt very badly. &#34;Enough for today &#34;, he removed a huge handkerchief from the pocket of his jeans. He pursed it in between my lips and tied the knot thereafter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kicked him on his knees, it didn&#39;t work. In fact, it exasperated him more, he interlocked both my hands and connected a rope on it, preventing them to move any further. He picked me up and rested my stomach on his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My whole world felt upside down, I only hoped for Mr. Reynolds. Every time I was in trouble he rescued me. I didn&#39;t let any pessimistic thoughts to cross my mind. James walked steadily with me on his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On reaching a certain spot, he threw me inside. On turning my eye-balls around I realized that it was a trunk of some cars. He jerked it close as soon as he placed me inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness surrounded, I couldn&#39;t see anything even with my eyes. My eyes were paining due to the excessive flow of water from it. My tears dried naturally as I couldn&#39;t wipe it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried screaming out loud but no one heard me. To my relief, the car didn&#39;t move yet. I pushed the trunk lid continuously through my body but it didn&#39;t move too, not even an ounce of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat was parched due to my incalculable shouting attempts. My superior eyelid interacted with my inferior eyelid due to tiredness. I stayed that way for a long time and finally lost consciousness.</p>
