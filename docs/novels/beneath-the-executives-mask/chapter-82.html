                <p>Amanda&#39;s Pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my brows , neatly placed the folk on the table and wiped off my hands with the napkin as I prepared myself to question him in order to sort out the confusion which battled in my brain ,&#34;Why is your blood not boiling with anger , I literally locked you in my room&#39;s bathroom &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a bite of his sandwich , eyed me without breaking any contacts even for once . I turned my attention away for a while and then settled it towards his direction .I raised my brows as an attempt to expect an answer but to my surprise he was silent, very silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What ?&#34;, he chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me &#34;, fine , I was growing impatient .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The question is ?&#34;, he acted all holy . I wanted to stab him innumerable time. It was weird because he didn&#39;t shout or insult me even for once . He was acting all cool adding fumes to my anger .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fake smiled outstretching my lips a bit more than normal ,&#34;Why are you not mad at me , I locked you in the bathroom , I scored a point against you . Where is the ass-hole in you ? Did it die ? Or I should wait for uglier consequences ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled gulping his bites with a sip of orange juice ,&#34;Why would I be mad at you ? you turned me on , I got a chance to, you know, kiss you . I partly made love to you there , I don&#39;t regret anything , not even the consequences which you served me &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh , and now you&#39;re talking dirty &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just initiated it , I&#39;m just appreciating your actions with my words &#34;, I turned my head away , I felt embarrassed , very embarrassed . He was stretching the topic on purpose, to bring out the shyness within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should be rejoining office &#34;, I glanced straight in his dark blue eyes . His expressions didn&#39;t look much satiating to my last sentence . He didn&#39;t answer me , considering my question irrelevant . &#34;I can&#39;t just stay here doing nothing , take me with you . I&#39;ll die out of boredom here , please &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept a finger on my lips shutting me down ,&#34;Don&#39;t you ever talk about dying again . No one&#39;s gonna die , if death&#39;s gonna come than it has to encounter me before you &#34;, I gasped , my heart raced at his unanticipated reaction . It was suppose to be a joke, why did he take it to another level? why did he acted like my life was very important to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay ! &#34;, I breathed in, I didn&#39;t have anything else to say so....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Reynolds &#34;, I paused &#34;I mean Aaron &#34;, I interrupted the silence .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like it when you call me by my first name, it sounds sexy &#34;, he broke my words whilst continuing his sentence .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pouted annoyingly ,&#34;I&#39;m calling you by your firs--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah , because you don&#39;t respect me anymore . I&#39;ve heard that story a while ago &#34;, he cut my sentence and preceded his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poking him on his chest with my pointer finger , I warned him to shut the fuck up . Before, he didn&#39;t speak at all and now there was no off switch or maybe we seemed to take each other&#39;s place, let me minus my clumsy part first though .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After waiting for the atmosphere to calm down , I broke the silence ,&#34;If I&#39;m staying here , I&#39;m paying you for the expenses which are being incurred for my good . I-uh can&#39;t just stay with you without paying a penny , what will people consider me ? A gold digger ? your mistress? &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t seem pretty much convinced with my offer ,&#34;Maybe you should leave the thinking part on me &#34;, he looked at me with a poker face . I folded my hands firmly , making up my mind to not settle on anything rather than what I proposed for . Considering the fact that , whoever eats /drinks without paying for it , is supposedly a gold digger .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take money from a woman ? Really ?&#34;, he arched his brows &#34;You&#39;re hitting straight on my manhood ego . I know you&#39;re not a gold digger , okay ? &#34;, he pulled my chair closer interrupting the distance which kept us apart . I inhaled, my eyes widened in shock .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My side thighs almost touched his knees, there was clothing which came in between of course ,&#34;I am not taking any money from you &#34;, he propelled his decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed ,&#34;Fine , I am not staying here without paying you . &#34;, he nodded his head from left to right simply meaning a no . I was firm on my decision too so I picked myself up in order to leave his mansion but he had great grip over my arms . He yanked me closer to him which ended my ass on his thighs .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled away at once but his grip was stronger. Maybe, I should hit the gym.My cheeks touched his nose leaving me uncomfortable , my cheeks heated red and my heart raced. Was there an off switch over these happenings which took birth in my body on sensing his touch?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So ? Mr Pervert ? &#34;, I decided to skip straight to the topic without beating around the bush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already took a decision , I am not taking a single money from you &#34;, I felt a tickle in my stomach because of the warmth of his body , my brain cells ceased to function and so did my reflexes . Why was the most uncomfortable place blessing me with the comfort I desired for .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tucked away my hair-lock behind my ear, gazed straight in his eyes and continued ,&#34;You can&#39;t take money from me but you can atleast deduct it from my provident fund? You can, right? &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can but I won&#39;t &#34;, he smiled .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, the thought of some unknown paying for my expenses suffocates me, it hits straight on my self-respect &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unknown ?&#34;, he questioned in a low tone ,&#34;Yeah, okay! &#34;, he continued whilst settling me on the other chair again. He sauntered slowly towards the stairs, precisely his room . &#34;Aaron &#34;,I shouted his name , he turned around instinctively facing me .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I unseated myself and walked towards him, I halted when we weren&#39;t much away from each other ,&#34;I have a presentation tomorrow, in college. I can&#39;t miss it at any chance which means I have to leave this place in the morning. I can&#39;t afford to miss it, it&#39;ll reflect directly on my grades. I assure, I&#39;ll be safe &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After stating my decision , I took small steps towards my room . He neither replied nor answer me, he was back to being the old Aaron Reynolds who considered every statement of mine irrelevant.</p>
