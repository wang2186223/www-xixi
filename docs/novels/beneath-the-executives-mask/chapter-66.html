                <p>AMANDA&#39;S POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waking up to the phone&#39;s flashlight I closed my eyes again instinctively. My neck choked due to inefficient air in the trunk. I took a deep breath when I spotted Mr. Reynolds. Tears started to make way from my eyes through my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly loosened the knot of the handkerchief which rested on my lips. I parted my lips and took the air in through it. I felt choked and helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a baby, he slowly and softly removed me from the trunk of the car. He instinctively released my hands which were tightly gripped by the rope. Scars were clearly visible on my wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I straightened my legs as they were curled up inside. It pained, it pained so much. I couldn&#39;t explain. He tucked away from the hair which rested on my forehead, I pushed my head on his chest as I settled myself in him. I closed my eyes whilst he moved his hands through my hair as he pulled me closer. I could hear his heart-beats, they kind of assured me that I was safe now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wept as I wasn&#39;t able to possess control over my emotions. In his arms, I felt peace. I sighed as he caressed my back continuously. I didn&#39;t pull away, I stayed that way. In his arms, I felt secure. He tucked my baby-hair behind my ears again as he examined my wrecked face. He didn&#39;t say anything, neither did I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze rested on my shoulder which had a cut, I tried to hide it with my hand as it looked vulnerable. The blood which surrounded the area almost dried, covering the wound with his coat he gently stroked my chin. &#34;You okay ?&#34;, he finally broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmhmm &#34;, I nodded whilst smiling and crying at the same time. My body pained and so did the cut on my shoulder. I pulled him closer again and wrapped my hands around his neck, he hugged me back. I didn&#39;t intend to pull away but I did in a while, he stayed still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his attention settled on the handkerchief which lip sealed me, he picked it up instinctively. It had a message, Oh my lord. James was definitely playing a dirty game with us. It read &#34;Just a trailer &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, I realized the fact that the car was of no one but Mr. Reynolds. He buried me in the trunk of Mr. Reynolds&#39;s car. What even was playing in his mind, I didn&#39;t have any idea about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know I was here &#34;, I interrogated as Mr. Reynolds examined the handkerchief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There was a small note on the name-plate of the car. It read &#39;save her before she dies out of exhaustion &#39; &#34;, he showed me the note. &#34;I really had an opinion that you left the party and made yourself comfortable at the hotel so I didn&#39;t really come looking for you &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caressed my shoulder as the wound pained &#34;Someone just shoved me away from the club&#34;, I wiped off the tears which blurred my vision. I couldn&#39;t stop but rethink the whole scenario again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He definitely has something dirty planned &#34;, after giving me his hand, he helped me walk till the back seat. Did he just allow me to sit on the back seat ? &#34;lie down here, we&#39;ll get your wounds diagnosed once we reach the hotel &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay &#34;, I laid on the seat while he drove. The rest of the ride was silent, the only voices which were audible were of the innumerable horns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On stopping the car he unlocked the car&#39;s door. My legs shivered while I walk so I took shelter from Mr. Reynolds&#39;s shoulders. Curling my arms through his neck I felt at ease. He walked us to our room and helped me lay on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly called the room service through the hotel&#39;s telephone. &#34;Hey can you help me with a doctor&#39;s number &#34;, he noted down the number using a pen and inscribed it on his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, an old man entered our room. His shirt was surrounded by a white overcoat and round spectacles rested on his nose. His appearance could easily denote the fact of him being a doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He marched towards us with his small suitcase. On closely examining the wound, he first cleaned it up with an antiseptic. After applying the ointment he covered it with a band-aid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, here are the pills you got to take three times in a day &#34;, he instructed me about the medicines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh- oh, but you already cured it doc. I guess I&#39;ll do fine without medicines too &#34;, I objected. I, like any other girl, hated medicines so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No baby, you&#39;ve to take them in order to get well &#34;, what was the doctor considering me, a kid? I pouted in dismay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He handed me the glass of water along with medicines. I closed my eyes and gulped them without sensing its bitter flavor. After the doctor left, I removed my nightdress from my bag and made way towards the washroom. I paired my sleeveless tank top with my pajamas since the doctor advised me to wear a loose dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After having dinner, I comforted myself on the bed since it was my turn today. Without complaining, Mr. Reynolds fixed himself on the small couch. My body was small as compared to him so a thought bypassed my mind that if my tiny body had to face so many difficulties on that small couch then how will his muscular body make space there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I should share the bed with him or maybe I should sleep on the couch myself and let him have the bed. &#34;Mr. Reynolds &#34;, I broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; he questioned whilst opening his shirt buttons. I could see his naked torso which showed his muscular cuts perfectly. I tried ignoring it and continued my further sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gathered my hair into a bun &#34;You can take the bed &#34;, I looked towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, do you want to sleep with me ?&#34;, he mischievously smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! I want you to have possession of the bed. I&#39;ll make myself comfortable on the couch like yesterday &#34;, I crossed my legs and sat on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. We both made a mutual decision earlier, I&#39;ll stick to that &#34;, he straightened his legs, they didn&#39;t fit perfectly on the couch. We only had one huge blanket so as I was sleeping on the bed, I could avail of the blanket&#39;s facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned off the switch and concealed the room with darkness. It was getting cold so I surfaced the blanket on my body properly. I closed my eyes and decided to practice optimism. Today could&#39;ve gone wrong if James wouldn&#39;t have buried me in the trunk of Mr. Reynolds&#39;s car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why didn&#39;t he take me along and killed me that very moment? What exactly did the word trailer mean? Scared would be a small word in relevance to my situation, I was horrified, to be honest. I kept my eyes closed and buried my head on the pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When my eyes opened in the middle of the night, I turned on my lock-screen to have a look at the time. It was 4:00 am, I pushed the &#39;on&#39; button of the table lamp to see through the room as it was very dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds slept uneasily on the couch. His body was slowly trembling out of cold, he hugged himself through his arms as an attempt to create warmth. The cold didn&#39;t affect me much yesterday but he was definitely influenced by it. I felt guilty because he had to compromise on his luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up the bed-sheet and marched towards the couch. His face looked extremely beautiful, his well-defined jaw with subtle beards looked more attractive while he slept. I star-gazed at him for a while, I pushed the baby hair away which rested on his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thing which stroke my mind was, I could look at him forever. Forever was a long time but I didn&#39;t mind spending it by his side. I no longer felt the need to control my emotions as I began to respect them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gently covered his body with the warm bed-sheet and stroked his cheek with the back of my hand. I was careful about my movements because I didn&#39;t want to wake him up. The view was enchanting, I didn&#39;t really have the urge to go back on the bed but I had to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly walked to the bed on my toes so as to prevent myself from making any noise. I covered my body with my long scarf as it really was cold. Thinking about Mr. Reynolds, a smile escaped my lips, was it really love or just an attraction?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waking up to the smell of food was the best thing about this morning. I quickly brushed my teeth and pounced on the chocolate overloaded waffles with french toasts accompanied with a jar full of orange juice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds wasn&#39;t visible, the sheet was neatly folded and placed on the bed. I knew that it took me a while to wake up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stuffed the food in my mouth one by one as I was hungry. I gulped down the whole orange juice in one take. I slowed down my eating activity when I heard footsteps. I knew it was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly pushed the baby strands back into my hair so as to look presentable . &#34;good morning &#34;, I smiled as I looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, did you eat your medicines ?&#34;, he questioned. Oh hello, how about a good morning to you too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet &#34;, I answered.</p>
