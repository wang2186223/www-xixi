                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Gina, I already submitted my application for leave to the principal. I&#39;m planning to complete further studies through distance. I&#39;ll be there during exams and presentations. I&#39;ll pay you guys to visit whenever I have free time &#34;, I tried to convince Gina as she stood silent on the other side of the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re making decisions way very quickly ?&#34;, she didn&#39;t seem much convinced though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve thought about it for a long time. I&#39;ve already changed my mind, please don&#39;t make this decision difficult for me now &#34;, I paused as Gina didn&#39;t react &#34;I thought I could adjust my college life with office life, but I guess I am failing. We can&#39;t travel in two boats at one time, right ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it&#39;s your decision then I respect it . &#34;, she finally spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love you, Gina, bye for now &#34;, I pushed my chair inwards as I rested my chin on my table out of boredom. I didn&#39;t really have much work to do as Mr. Reynold&#39;s wasn&#39;t visible to me since the morning, he definitely was out somewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did peep several times in his cabin through the glass but the chair was vacant, I had this urge since the morning to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amanda, you&#39;re going crazy sweetheart. Stop fangirling over him so much &#34;, my negative subconscious spoke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what do I do ?&#39;, I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ignore him, do not confront him. You&#39;re losing your heart to someone who doesn&#39;t have it &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop, shut up &#34;, I pulled off my thoughts as I studied the piles of files that were on my table. I tried to divert my mind away from him so I decided to go hang out with either Sonia or Dan instead. I quickly stood up as I reached towards the accounting department where Sonia worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t give me details about yesterday bitch &#34;, she shook vibrantly out of shock, her reflex wasn&#39;t used to sudden meets I guess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;you have no idea &#34;, she hugged me grinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want the idea . Tell me everything in bits and pieces &#34;, I hugged her back excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He asked for my number after the dance, we almost chat the whole night &#34;, a blush escaped her lip. She looked happy, very happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could be made out from your dark circles &#34;, I teased her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;oh my God, do I have one? He asked me to have lunch with him in the canteen. Oh no Amanda&#34;, she looked so hesitant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am kidding &#34;, I laughed hysterically at her reactions. She hit me playfully on my hands whilst she sighed in peace. &#34;I should keep going, wanted to check you out as I couldn&#39;t resist last night&#39;s gossip.&#34;, I pinched on level 7 of the elevator at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I maintained my tradition as I peeped in his cabin, he was seated. He looked straight in his laptop, I stood there bird watching. As his chin tilted, his eyes met mine. Oh no, did he actually notice me staring at him? This was one awkward situation from which I couldn&#39;t turn away. I stood there silently for a while and then knocked at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He guided me in so I pushed the door as I made myself in. &#34;Good afternoon, Mr. Reynolds &#34;, he was stunned by my greeting as this was one of the rare days when I wished him. I am losing myself in front of him, what&#39;s wrong with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re okay, Miss Waters ?&#34;, he questioned me as he stopped doing his work. Maybe I should stop surprising him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went straight towards him, placed my hand around his neck as I rested my lips on his. Initially, I brushed my lips on his lips softly, but then I felt the urge to taste him so I bit his lower lip. He rested his hands on the back of my head as he lifted me up so I twirled my legs around his stomach as I gasped the moment we parted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without breaking our kiss, he placed me gently on the table as he sided his laptop. I caught his neck pushing him closer to me. Slowly, the kiss turned passionate as he started opening my buttons, I ran my hands through his back as I pushed him towards me again. Every time we panted because of difficulty in breathing, I had this desire to pull him in a kiss again. He was being irresistible or maybe I was being erotic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved his palms through my cheek as he cupped my face, he placed soft kisses on my nose, my jaws, my upper neck. He started moving towards my lower neck, I felt a tickle in my stomach as I stood straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Waters &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Waters ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Amanda Waters &#34;, he shook me hard this time. Oh my God, I was dreaming. It was a day-dream. Since when did I start having Day-dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you in your senses ?&#34;, he questioned me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am &#34;, I nodded as I yanked his hands away from my body. His touch gave me shivers which affected me so much. Maybe my negative sub-conscience was right, I should avoid him and not give much importance to his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What were the noises you removed lately? he chuckled. I looked away so as to avoid any eye contact with him but one thing I noticed was his change towards me, yeah he was rude but his behavior changed a lot since the day we came back from the James incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have work, I should keep going &#34;, I lied as I pushed my hair lock behind my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Start packing for the trip to Werttop, we leave tomorrow &#34;, he imposed his decision on me, he didn&#39;t ask me for once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My answer was obviously a no as I couldn&#39;t afford to spend the whole weekend with him again. I decided to avoid his presence as it was racking my brain and heart continuously. &#34;I am not coming with you. Sorry &#34;, I gathered all my courage as I spoke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t ask you. I commanded to which you have to obey &#34;, he threw daggers at me with his eyes, maybe Mr. Richie Rich isn&#39;t prone to the word &#39;no&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mom is very possessive for her first baby, she won&#39;t allow me to go on the other side of the country with some stranger &#34;, yeah, I addressed him as a stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you tell your mother when you were out for a long time, basically kidnapped ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That I was on a business trip &#34;, I replied instinctively as I held my mouth tightly realizing that he just fooled me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t trick me like that &#34;, I pointed my finger towards him as I pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See you tomorrow at 9 am sharp Miss Waters, it&#39;s not really warm in that part of the city. Carry some warm clothes along &#34;, he made his way towards his seat again as he made a phone call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth does he think of himself, I am not going anywhere with him but did I have any other option? I decided to avoid him throughout the trip. A part of me was very excited about the big trip and a part of me was scared of the consequences too. I knew that I was losing control of my feelings. I didn&#39;t want to think about him but every time I decided to think differently, he popped out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;May I come in, Madam ?&#34;, I heard a female knock at my door. I invited her in, I didn&#39;t look up as I was busy figuring out my feelings by resting my jaws on my knuckles which rested on my elbows. Sonia patted my head and took my attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t look fine &#34;, she made out from my facial expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you name a term when you lose yourself into someone. You feel vulnerable emotionally when you don&#39;t see the person ? When you make scripts in your mind and expect one specific person to follow it? When you dream about someone and expect them to stay in front of you when the dream gets over? &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sonia heard every word of mine very carefully . She didn&#39;t dare to interrupt as she examined every word which escaped my lips. &#34;You&#39;re highly attracted Amanda , it can turn into love any moment&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am ?&#34;, I questioned .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;you are &#34;, she answered .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do I avoid this feeling ?&#34;, I felt agitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You simply get under someone else to get over him &#34;, she chuckled &#34;Wait, who is him? Is he Mr. Aaron Reynolds, The Aaron Reynolds ?&#34;, she seem bewildered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded as I had no answer . I studied her face which was in complete shock . Did I really fall for the wrong guy ? Oh no this thought was devastating me. &#34;It&#39;s okay you&#39;ll get over him &#34;, she consoled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But for that I&#39;ve to get under him &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched me with cornered eyes as she grinned like an idiot &#34;Naughty , really naughty . Getting under him eh ?&#34;, she laughed continuously while I pouted in embarrassment throughout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just so you know, you&#39;re no help to me &#34;, I pulled the file closer to me and threw it on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch, that hurt &#34;, she yet laughed &#34;Do tell me, Amanda, when you get under him &#34;, she took a deep breath so as to control her laughter. She failed, miserably failed.</p>
