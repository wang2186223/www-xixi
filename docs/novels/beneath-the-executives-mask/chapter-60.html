                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was dark around as it was approximately 1 am. I couldn&#39;t see the surroundings much as darkness concealed the environment. It was cold, really cold. I rubbed my arms from my hands in order to generate heat as a quick shiver passed through my veins. My skin followed its tradition of becoming red when exposed to extreme cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if Mr. Reynolds removes his blazers and warm me up through it just like in movies? A quick blush escaped my lips on thinking about such irrelevant stuff. I bet half the girls made scenarios in their head with their crush. A crush?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Mr. Reynolds and Miss Waters, we hope to enlighten your presence here as much as we can. We&#39;ve made special arrangements especially for you &#34;, their senior-most welcomed us warmly and guided us to the hotel&#39;s lobby as we trespassed the garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for the warm gesture &#34;, I appreciated the arrangements which they made for us. A lady welcomed us with a rose bouquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry we had to change the venue from Paris to Werttop, I really apologize. After exploring this place, I and my team decided to start the redevelopment project here so we invited you at once &#34;, Mr. Reynolds pushed the strands of his hairs back as he didn&#39;t really care about his apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s very late right now, we&#39;ll catch you up tomorrow morning. You can rest, for the time being, I&#39;ve informed the room service to bring you&#39;ll dinner. &#34;, he handed us the keys as he continued to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Mr. Henry, we need two rooms. I&#39;ll book the other one by myself &#34;, Mr. Reynolds was as confused as me because the keys were of one room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Henry grinned at us &#34;Its okay Mr. Reynolds and Miss Waters, Cody informed us about your relationship status and suggested us to give you some space here. He was well aware of your condition to keep it private. No one will know about you or disturb the sweet couple here &#34;, he grinned harder this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh no, Cody</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my attention towards Mr. Reynolds, he had the same straight face as me. This time we were in trouble because of him as he was the one who wanted us to enact the fake relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We together bid Mr. Henry goodnight as he escorted us towards our room. No, we didn&#39;t talk with each other throughout. As soon as I pushed the door close, I landed my suitcase in the corner of our room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? &#34;, I looked at him as he was already staring at me &#34;You are the culprit now&#34;, I pointed at him making it look more dramatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Fine. I admit. I&#39;m glad--&#34;, I cut him off</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you&#39;re glad that you get to spend the whole night with me in the same room &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me complete Miss Waters &#34;, he objected &#34;I&#39;m glad that it&#39;s you rather than Mr. Cody. He&#39;s such an amazing guy undoubtedly but yet &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean I am savage? &#34;, I teased</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up already&#34;, he threw his Blazer on the floor. Hey, you&#39;re sharing this room with me, please don&#39;t fuck with the cleanliness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After freshening up and changing into our night wears, we called up the room service to send us dinner. It was served within 15 minutes from our call. After eating dinner, I quickly paved the way towards the bed so as to mark it as my territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, Miss Waters ?&#34;, he sided the food tray as he sat next to me on the bed. Oh my God, did he intend to take advantage of me? A simple touch and I&#39;d let him take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What ?&#34;, I arched my brows towards him unknowingly to what he was up to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Waters &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;yeah! I heard that. Tell me something rather than that &#34;, he smirked at me. I knew he was planning something cunning, I just had no idea what. I looked at him perplexed as he glided towards me, our arms touched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh no, did he have any hint of me staring at him while he was driving? Fuck you, hormones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds moved his fingers through the back of my hair and finally settled his hand in them. Within moments he squatted as he slowly moved his hands from my thigh to the back of my knee. His touch tickled me and my stupid mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no, bring me down at once &#34;, I screamed as he picked me up bridal style. I moved my legs up and down so that he&#39;d leave me at once because of annoyance. I hit him on his back as my hands were around his neck. I was just taking support because I didn&#39;t trust this psycho billionaire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hit him harder as he didn&#39;t settle me on the ground but instead he kept moving slowly. &#34;I&#39;ll file a suit for molestation against you. Get me down at once Mr. Richie Rich &#34;, yeah I just said his secret nickname in front of him. He looked at me, his face showed perfectly that he didn&#39;t like the nickname.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Molestation, eh. You want me to show you what that is ?&#34;, he chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After reaching the couch, he threw me on it. I&#39;m glad it was soft or I would&#39;ve broken my bones otherwise. Now I knew what was going in his mind, the thought of possessing the bed. I frowned when he made an eye contact, a small disturbed pout naturally took birth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cheated me &#34;, the couch was small, very small. If I had to sleep on it the whole night then I had to be very stiff and alarmed. A small move and I am down on the floor. Either I had to take shelter of my right arms or my left as I couldn&#39;t sleep straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a cheat. I marked the bed as mine &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You say that like you&#39;re a werewolf &#34;, he chuckled. His face showed fifty shades of amusement. He definitely was making fun of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a sitting position at once as when he threw me on the couch, my t-shirt got a bit lifted up showing an excessive amount of my stomach. I comforted my dress before continuing the argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I can&#39;t sleep here. What if I fall? The conclusion is I am not sleeping here. Why don&#39;t you sleep here instead ?&#39;, I questioned as he glared me. &#34;It was you who wanted us to act like a couple in front of Cody &#34;, I offended preventing myself to use a high pitched voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I have an idea. Try sleeping on the floor &#34;, he was so stubborn. I wouldn&#39;t mind sleeping on the floor if he&#39;d said those words in a low, sweet, and polite tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to negotiate or the next thing I&#39;ll do is tell Cody the truth. I&#39;ve had told it earlier to Mr. Linley, just so you remember &#34;, I outstretched my lips making it look like a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine&#34;, he agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; How long are we here for ?&#34;, I interrogated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;6 days &#34;, he answered instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we have a way out &#34;, I winked &#34;we sleep on the bed one by one alternatively, no one gets to escape the experience of sleeping on the couch &#34;, I signaled him a thumbs up.</p>
