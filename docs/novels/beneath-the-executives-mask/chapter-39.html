                <p>&#34;Fine but this game will be according to my guidelines. Explain to me how it is played &#34;, he finally agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YAY! &#34; I did a small happy dance by jumping whilst stretching my hands upwards. &#34;So since we&#39;re walking I just renamed it to A walk to remember, it&#39;s one of my favorite movies .&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;so the game is that you do the talking and I do the listening, more or less of it right &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop being sarcastic for once &#34;, I pouted, &#34;I say a word and you say feelings of yours towards that word without taking more than 2 seconds. Its originally called rapid-fire, I&#39;ll say words and you have to react to them. You can have your turn only if you want to ask me otherwise never mind &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carry on, I&#39;m in &#34;, he showed a bit interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused for a while then asked the first-word &#34;FEAR &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None now &#34;, he smirked which clearly meant he has overcome his fright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Favorite food ?&#34;, I readied my third question up already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Homemade food, I don&#39;t mind whatever it is. I like and prefer healthy as 80% of the time I have to order food from the restaurants&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just Mr. Reynold&#39;s things&#34;, I murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you say something&#34;, he pretended he didn&#39;t hear but my mutter was clear enough for him to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One person you live for ?&#34;, I asked without a full stop ignoring his last statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myself and the millions of people who earn their living because of my company &#34;, he slowed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow diplomatic and thoughtful &#34;, I never knew he had a good side too. I figured out one thing that he never mentions or want someone to mention his good side. He liked it closed and private. &#34;The person you hate ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh I-I think you &#34;, he winked at me &#34; Kidding, I don&#39;t hate you. I dislike you, the words stand out differently and have huge differences in their meanings. I hate James. I do&#34;, his face dimmed a bit so I tried to change the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Favorite actress ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None, I don&#39;t believe in fiction. Oh, wait. I have a thing for Mother Teresa, I respect her so much. She is my heroine. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feels like I am interviewing you as you&#39;re standing up in elections as your answers are so neat and diplomatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;that&#39;s who I am &#34;, he offended &#34;I am being honest eh. Enough of me, your turn &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me&#34;, I pointed at myself &#34;I am in, Thought you&#39;ll never ask me, yay&#34;, I clapped out of excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Favorite person?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, of course ! so obvious. Ask me challenging questions &#34;, I winked doing a quick hair flip. I could feel his level of annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you a virgin?&#34;, he cornered his eyes to check on my expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think this is kind of a below-the-belt type of question&#34;, I offended in a higher pitch and then resorted back to normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made a straight face &#34;Someone wanted challenging questions eh. Anyways you lose Miss Waters, this game is supposed to have a question followed by an answer rather than a question followed by a question&#34;, he smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God. I should&#39;ve understood your strategy. One last chance, please. &#34;, I knew I lost and wasn&#39;t getting any second chances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyways, I am definitely a virgin. A 20-year-old virgin in this modern world &#34;, I cleared my point purposely as I didn&#39;t want him to create any false opinions regarding me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look much convinced with my answer. He finally broke the silence &#34;I don&#39;t think so Miss Waters, I witnessed your make out with James for a second at Pallapora town with my damn eyes, I didn&#39;t want to eavesdrop so I left &#34;, he cleared his throat &#34;No one is really virgin among us Miss Waters, stop playing all nice and innocent &#34;, he was very confident regarding losing his virginity in the past, his words were indirect yet straight-forward</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me, if I told you the whole truth you won&#39;t believe it nor will you believe me &#34;, I tried convincing him about the truth because what he saw was only the half-truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to believe and I am guessing the game is over plus I&#39;d not like getting indulged in your personal space. It&#39;s your life after all &#34;, he was so stubborn. He wasn&#39;t giving me a chance to speak up for myself. This misunderstanding was affecting me so much, I didn&#39;t even realize why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me at least clear my point &#34;, I thumped my toes and caught his walking speed. Suddenly we heard the leaves moving like someone was stepping on them slowly and carefully. I examined our walking style to figure out whether it was ours but my mind was blown to the fact that it wasn&#39;t our footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ow, my leg &#34;, I acted like there was a sprain on my leg to check out whether we were being stalked. I cornered my eyes towards the direction of the noise and not to my surprise I saw three humanly figures behind the tree, not specifically their bodies but the shadows formed out of reflection from the sun. After talking further, I saw four more figures behind the back of the tree which was distanced from us but visible to some extent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart almost plummeted on the ground and then regained back its original position as an outcome of terror. I widened my eyes but then resorted back to normal trying to act sane. &#34;Are you doing fine ?&#34;, Mr. Reynolds inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. What will happen to me, I&#39;m fine, thanks&#34;, I stood up and stayed more active than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to tell Mr. Reynolds about it, I just had to think about a clever plan to explain the situation to him without making the hooligans aware. I pulled Mr. Reynolds extremely close to me and thought for a while to pick between hug or kiss. If I hugged him the hooligans would figure it with my lips moving. That just left me with the last option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our nose touched and our eyeballs met, I knew that he&#39;d definitely judge me for a while for this action but what mattered was him knowing the truth about this moment. I balled the back of his head with my palms making a movement with my fingers through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I uplifted my cheek as he was bigger in height. I pressed my lips against his lips without wasting a second. I could sense his astonishment, I made sure my face wasn&#39;t visible to the hooligans so I parted my lips away for like 0.000001 inches. &#34;They&#39;re here. We&#39;ve been spotted Mr. Reynolds &#34;, I whispered extremely softly, my lips collided with his lips after every movement of mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed my back towards the closest tree pressing his lips hard to mine. I knew he did this so that the stalkers didn&#39;t get the clue of us talking in between. He pressed his lips harder this time asking permission for entrance, I permitted. Our tongues collided with each other roughly giving us a feel of each other&#39;s mouth. His hand lifted me up as I twirled my legs around his waist continuing the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We parted away to breathe, I let out a small moan. He unplugged my back from the tree and slowly and steadily started to walk whilst kissing me harder every time. Yes, his kisses raced my heart like no one ever did before but maybe this time he was carried away with the moment and was charged to inevitable pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands moved throughout my hips. He parted his lips again and placed soft kisses on my cheeks, licking it a bit. I could feel my cheeks turning wet. He continued this action and pinned me towards the other tree which was pretty much at a great distance away from the old one. His hands traveled through my breasts. A little amount of moan escaped my lips, my eyes were straight in position with the hooligans who didn&#39;t dare to move after our make out as my face was in contact with their direction this whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sucked my neck, I pulled him closer to mine interlocking my hands against my neck. His lips traveled from the chin to my mid-neck. He pulled my dress a bit down which showcased half of my cleavage. &#34;Are they looking at us &#34;, he questioned while sucking the top of my cleavage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woah! yeah. &#34;, I signaled him. &#34;Let&#39;s move on to the next tree then &#34;, he came extremely close to me before kissing me down my throat after uplifting me again. We were now inches away from them, he pulled me apart and later on the ground. His hands were placed on my waist now, we kept walking slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;so, are you ready Miss Waters?&#34; he questioned moving his hands away and breaking his touch over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am&#34;, I turned a bit to inquire about them, they were yet very far away from us now. I took up the position of get-set-go and ran as swiftly as I could. Mr. Reynolds&#39;s speed was obviously faster than mine but I did my best to catch up with his. I took long strides than usual to match his race as best as I could.</p>
