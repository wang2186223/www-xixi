                <p>Aaron Reynolds&#39;s Pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sauntered around the party greeting all my business associates one by one. I usually hated to do such formalities but I had to .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noted one thing through out this party . Miss Waters wasn&#39;t around , she usually kept showing herself up after every couple of minutes but today she wasn&#39;t visible . It felt odd . I didn&#39;t see her from the moment we distanced from each other . I threw the mask to the nearest bin after separating myself from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is she in trouble ? Not again. I decided to inquire about her so I paved my way towards Cody . &#34;Hey , did you see Miss Waters around ?&#34;, I questioned breaking his intimacy with his partner. I don&#39;t remember his name so its better I term him as his partner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone&#39;s missing someone &#34;, Cody chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously ? Can&#39;t he think about anything apart from this topic. &#34;Yeah , have you seen her around ? &#34;, I tried resorting back to the question I previously asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not after you left &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks &#34;, I smiled sarcastically as he proved out to be no help to me . I needed to find her , to safeguard her . She could be in trouble , James was trouble. What if something bad happened to her ? What if I am not on time before something devastating happens ?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stroke away the negative thoughts which were taking birth in my mind. I decided to have a word regarding it with Mr Caleb . He wasn&#39;t in the party so I gave him a call and informed him to meet me in the hotel&#39;s technical room so that we could have a surveillance through the cctv camera&#39;s footage .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a seat while waiting for him . Yeah , I was given access to the confidential footage . I had 40% of the shareholdings of this hotel plus my name always did half the work . &#34;Hey , took you too long &#34;, I sighed on arrival of Mr Caleb .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded greeting me and entered the code as the hotel used encryption . &#34;hey look &#34;, he pointed towards a figure who was talking with Miss Waters whilst she was eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh No. Fuck no . Fuck him &#34;, I analyzed his outfit and realized that it matched mine . His outward appearance matched my look too . Someone disguised himself as me to take advantage over her. No, the question of someone doesn&#39;t arises . It was James , definitely James.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The pieces match , extend the tape to the place he&#39;s taking her &#34;, I peeped in closer to have a magnified view. The footage was unclear as there was an enormous crowd in the party .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move , move , move , he&#39;s at the terrace &#34;, I clenched my fists and took long steps towards the terrace . I didn&#39;t care if Mr Caleb followed me or not , I had to save her . She had a virus named James involved in her life because of me , I had to clean the system before any mishap actually happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took longer steps then usual but didn&#39;t run , there were a lot of people present in the party . I didn&#39;t really intend to create a Chaos . After reaching the hallway , I multiplied my speed of walking into running . I saw the bodyguards waiting outside the locked door .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you idiots paid for ?&#34;, I questioned breathing fast .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir , if you&#39;re here then who is he ?&#34;, one of them spoke , agitation could be felt in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Break the door &#34;, I ignored his question and signaled him to break the door . I held my breadth , I was scared . Not of James but for Miss Waters . She was trouble since the say she walked in , she affected me though . She has been affecting me since the day we met . I regret doing that in past , the guilt doesn&#39;t allows me to shake a friendly hand with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No , we weren&#39;t friends . Maybe we were more or less . I created trouble for her every time to make her strong , I wanted to abolish her feelings towards me . Every time she looked at me with those enchanting eyes , I felt guilty and miserable . I avoided her and also roasted her all the time because it was the best for both of us . I knew she cared for me and to be honest I did too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let her sleep in the cold as if I&#39;d surrender my priorities for her , she&#39;d mistook it as love . I didn&#39;t want her to love me . I don&#39;t deserve love .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After knowing the real truth she&#39;ll hate me , the thought of her hating me made me want to hate myself . I&#39;ve been hated by a lot of people in the past and also in present but I didn&#39;t want her to be an add on to that number .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the door fled open I saw James pointing a gun towards her , precisely he had it placed on her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Reynolds , go away . Please &#34;, she cried signaling me to move away . James looked at me smirking evilly .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down , James &#34;, taking small steps towards him I tried to stop him .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to examine the footsteps and to my delight it was Mr Caleb with his team of 5 inspectors . I redirected my attention towards James and Miss Waters . She looked scared , who wouldn&#39;t be ?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;go away , Mr Reynolds . Please , I beg of you &#34;, this girl is definitely lunatic . She has someone triggering a gun on her face and all she&#39;s doing is caring for me . No one has really cared for me this much after my mom left .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;let&#39;s focus on Mr Reynolds&#39;s death then &#34;, James turned towards me . His face was plastered with a deadly smirk , he had his gun pointed towards my direction through out. I raised my eyebrows at him amused by his decision . I already had a small plan set up in my mind . Today was James&#39;s end , the only person who&#39;ll die today would be James .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare &#34;&#39;, Amanda yanked the revolver from his hand and possessed it over hers . Who is this woman and what has she done to my innocent troublesome Amanda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She directed the revolver towards James , her hands shivered while doing the same . I could see her character develop in a much stronger and better way .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No , baby girl . You&#39;re born to play with barbies as you&#39;re one . Not with guns &#34;, James snapped an angry look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am the barbie you shouldn&#39;t fiddle with . Not with me , not with the people I lo----&#34;, she paused . Did she mean love ? I somehow knew that she liked me but was she secretly in love with me ?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t matters &#34;, her voice shivered and so did her hands .</p>
