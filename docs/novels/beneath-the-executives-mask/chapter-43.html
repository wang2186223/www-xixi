                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God, No&#34;, I wiped off the tears sniffling. I had no idea how to prove out to be a help to Mr. Reynolds. I lacked strength, presence of mind, and science of course. I caught his hands and rubbed it vigorously trying to emit some movement out of it but again I proved out to be helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cleaned his face starting with his forehead swiping off the blood, there were some droplets which took birth within minutes even after removal of the additional blood which was reciprocal in nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I do? What the fuck do I do to prove out to help to this man &#34;, questions flooded in my mind. I placed my hands on his chest to feel his heart beats, to my surprise they were even slower now. A small amount of sweat tipped off from my forehead because of anxiety. I was very scared as his situation was turning worst from bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey God! I swear I&#39;ll give a good amount of charity to the needy once I return, I won&#39;t lie to anyone. At least for a month. I&#39;ll be holy enough to visit you daily. &#34; I bent my knees and looked towards the sky &#34;Please save Mr. Reynolds, he&#39;s a good man though he doesn&#39;t showcase the good in him&#34;, I raised my hands in unison while making a wish. I was never really a holy person but yes I believed in the almighty and his power to dominate and protect the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;CPA, oh yes cardio pulmonary resuscitation, why didn&#39;t I think about this earlier &#34;, I hit myself playfully on the head. Mr. Reynolds yet didn&#39;t show any sign of being in an active state. His face looked divine in this state, I couldn&#39;t stop but gaze at the view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tilted his head lifting his chin until his teeth almost touched. I looked towards him and listened to his breathing which was slow or almost broke due to certain damage caused on his brain cells. I could see the deep injury through my naked eye too, they hit him hard on the head continuously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I then started compressing his chest putting my hands in the center of his chest, between his nipples. I placed one hand on mine on top of the other pushing them down with the heel of my hand around 30 times. I continued with 2 breaths followed by 30 pushes. I did it as per I was taught in college when in a seminar of quick aids. I hoped to see him move but he didn&#39;t show any sign, a part of me whimpered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This means that I got to move quickly to the third step &#34;, I thought to myself &#34; Come on Amanda, it&#39;s not that you haven&#39;t kissed him earlier. This time it&#39;s for saving his life. Pump him your breadths &#34;, the positive Amanda was taking charge a lot at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I, without giving it a second thought pinched his nose close and covered his mouth with mine giving it 2 full breaths making sure each breath took not more than 1 second. Apart from monitoring the exhaled breath, I checked his chest, in order to see the rise and fall of the same. I took intervals at a regular frequency and paused to take a breath myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled away with my eyes closed, waiting for something assertive to happen. I half opened my eyes to have a check on Mr. Reynolds, his face looked the same. His chest didn&#39;t move which clearly meant that his breathing didn&#39;t gear up. I suddenly heard a small cough, I closely examined him assuring myself that my tricks worked after some minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes unenclosed in a slow and gradual manner showing off all the pain he had been feeling in his body. The sun shined on his face making his shade tone a bit lighter than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, you&#39;re fine ?&#34;, I ran towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I am &#34;, he turned me down wryly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch ! should be thanking me for saving your life &#34;, my face rested in his direction causing a droplet of blood from my wounded forehead dropping on his. &#34; So sorry &#34;, I wiped off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to escape before they come checking on us &#34;, he commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But look at you, you are a wreck right now &#34;, I tried stating things which were obvious &#34; You need to rest. I can walk if I put some efforts but you&#34;, I pointed at him &#34;You can&#39;t even walk so lay there and let me find some help &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be a boss when I am around. I&#39;m the boss remember &#34;, his voice broke in between due to his agony no matter how much he showed that he was doing fine. He tried standing up but couldn&#39;t even resist himself in affording the sitting position. He truly was a wreck right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go, find help Miss Waters. Go alone. Go home. Stay safe . &#34; he made sure his sentences were clear enough &#34;Send my men addressing them the location then &#34;, he caught his arms tightly to stop the blood from flowing very hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay &#34;, I stepped back just like he commanded. I made my way towards the highway in rumination about Mr. Reynolds. I could see vehicles around after safely crossing the forest. Something within me was not satisfied with my act, it felt like every bone my body comprised of was objecting against this decision of mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, lift &#34;, I flung my arms in the air to make the driver of the passerby car stop. He showed no humanity as he kept driving without giving a second thought for helping an injured lady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked for a while missing Mr. Reynolds&#39;s company. I remembered how much my voice and words annoyed him but his annoyance never stopped me from talking anyway . I enjoyed irritating him, to be honest. &#34;What the fuck am I doing ?&#34; I questioned myself whilst walking . I cant run away from this situation alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were into this thing together, what kind of a human am I. I left the person back who troubled himself to save me from all this. My guile was making me feel vulnerable emotionally. I took a turn towards the way which led me to him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I marched as fast as I could, regretting my previous decision, and on the thought of how selfish I got lately. I, within moments, reached the very place and to my satisfaction, Mr. Reynolds didn&#39;t move away. He laid there, his eyes half-closed. I ran fast towards him in aghast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not close your eyes &#34;, I shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes met mine &#34; I t-told you to g-go &#34;, he stammered. His face looked more tormented than before. &#34;So stubborn!&#34;, he exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Learnt from the best&#34;, I taunted so that I could keep up with the fight preventing him from sleeping as it was dangerous for him in this condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be fine after I take a nap, come lay with me j-just like that night when we counted stars&#34;, he demanded sleep, I could sense it from his eyes which watered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dare you to sleep , you&#39;re not allowed to. I like it when you&#39;re a pain in my ass . Stand up now and annoy me , violate me , insult me and if that doesn&#39;t covers your hate than even hit me. You-get-it-clear. You&#39;re not allowed to even wink without my consent &#34;, I said in one full breadth without pausing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just got lucky, you know that right. If my body would&#39;ve been responsive then you know well what the circumstance would&#39;ve been now &#34;, my plan was working. I instigated him on purpose so that he&#39;d fight me back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come let&#39;s go, lean on me&#34;, I tried giving a helping hand to which he caught grip instinctively.</p>
