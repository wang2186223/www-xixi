                <p>&#34;Okay&#34; I tried picking up the chair, only to end up walking like a drunkard. What? The chair was quite heavy to lift, and Mr. Reynolds, being the gentleman he is, of course, did not help. Actually forget helping; he didn&#39;t even offer to help, not that I would&#39;ve declined though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping out of my train of thoughts, I carefully positioned the chair below the shelf and took the support of Mr. Reynolds&#39; chair to get on it. &#34;Careful Miss Waters&#34;, Mr. Reynolds shifted his chair as a safety measure. From what? Oh nothing much, just from me falling over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll try my best sir&#34;, I assured him. He started working on his laptop, again. Since the day I&#39;ve entered his office, he was always on his laptop working. He never took free time from work, despite being the freaking CEO! His dedication kind of inspired me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the shelf and tried my best not to move, because if I moved even a little, the chair would move; leading to very serious consequences (which includes falling on my butt and breaking it). So I just took a brief view of all the files and tried searching for the one Mr. Reynolds wanted. I placed all the files on over one another very slowly, and carefully made only necessary moves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then while I was placing the files on the shelf, I felt like something ran over my fingers. The color from my face vanished almost instantly after my brain registered the fact that there was definitely some creepy creature inside. I really didn&#39;t want to see it because that would do nothing other than me screaming. Keeping up my courage, I carefully piled up the last file systematically. And then, the horror of horrors, that creepy thing crawled onto my hand. If you&#39;re wondering why am I overreacting, well it&#39;s just that I have an extremely bad experience with these horrible insects.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up on my toes to see the dreaded creature, and when I did, I started shaking and so did the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mis-mis-mister Rey-no-nolds&#34;, I stammered/yelled with whatever might I had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Miss Waters&#34;, he replied calmly. &#39;Get the fuck up from that chair and get this thing off me.&#39; That was what I wanted to tell him, but I couldn&#39;t get a word out of my mouth anymore. Not gaining a response from me for like a minute (I guess it was just a few seconds though) he finally stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s it Miss Waters?&#34; he questioned boringly and I could hear him walking towards me. Yeah, I hadn&#39;t dare look away from the devil, you know, in case it went up to my sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A liz-liz-lizard&#34;, I stammered and tried moving it off my palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was scared shitless and began walking backward carelessly; completely forgetting that I was on a freaking chair right now. Obviously I slipped and lost my balance and began flying, actually falling, on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes and accepted that I was going to fall and break my butt or my leg. Actually that&#39;s what I thought at that moment because 1) the chair wasn&#39;t that high and 2) I really don&#39;t know how butts break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally felt myself land, I was surprised that I hadn&#39;t made contact with anything hard; rather it was quite comfy, and I wasn&#39;t even hurt a percent. When I opened my eyes, I was greeted with myself in the arms none other than Mr. Reynolds himself. And, to be more specific, I was in his arms in bridal fucking style; and obviously, thanks to instincts which work extra hard when you don&#39;t need them to, my arms went around his neck for support. Well, he had obviously held me that way for grip and things like that but that was super-duper awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart almost fell out and my face was red with embarrassment; but then again, he had saved me from falling on the floor (which would&#39;ve been much worse). Although it was awkward, it was comforting in his arms at the same time. I felt close to him as I rested my head on his muscular chest. I could feel heartbeats, breath, and touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t utter a word; silence was all that was needed right now, in this situation. He carefully placed me on the floor (yeah literally) and then went back to work on his computer. Seriously, what does he do on there? Nonetheless, I got up and straightened out my dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you&#34;, I spoke softly as I walked up to his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just protected myself&#34;, he answered and closed his computer (finally). Although I would&#39;ve preferred a &#39;you&#39;re welcome&#39; or &#39;my pleasure&#39; instead of his rude comment (which honestly didn&#39;t make any sense to me), I smiled softly and let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Complete your work quickly, I&#39;m heading for lunch.&#34; He looked at his watch and continued, &#34;You are not allowed to go for lunch unless you found my file.&#34;, and he just left the cabin leaving me alone. What the hell does he think I am? A robot, or machine? Like, don&#39;t I need food for energy? But I couldn&#39;t do anything about it; instead, I decided to finish my work quickly and get the hell out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started looking for the file in all the shelves but thankfully it wasn&#39;t hard &#39;cause all the remaining shelves were either my height or at ground level; the only tall shelf was the one behind Mr. Reynolds&#39; desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After looking at all the shelves, I was aghast by the fact that the &#39;Amar and Sons&#39; file was nowhere to be seen! I had checked all the shelves carefully; so there was no question of I missing it. I thought of checking the only place that I hadn&#39;t checked: Mr. Reynolds&#39; desk. After looking around the tidily kept desk, I found the file which read &#39;Amar and Sons&#39; stacked at the bottom of the pile on his desk. I felt tricked! Mr. Reynolds had made me work for the entire day to find a file that was in front of his face on his desk this whole time!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s it. I had lost it and yelled, &#34;Son of a bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you say something, Miss Waters?&#34;, Mr. Reynolds asked calmly and he entered his cabin with his perfect face; only it was accompanied by an evil smirk this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no. Nothing, really!&#34; I made a poker face. &#34;One last question, can I?&#34; I looked at him, and spoke immediately as he was about to do so, &#34;And it&#39;s really relevant&#34;, I completed my statement for him before he could classify it as &#39;irrelevant&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure&#34;, he answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you already knew where the file was, then why waste my entire day?&#34;, I asked angrily, raising the most relevant question of the day, or night, or of the entire fucking century.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I wanted you to clean all the shelves&#34;, he answered like it was the obvious thing in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a maid for fuck&#39;s sake!&#34; I was so angry at him right now!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes, I&#39;m aware of that Miss Waters. It&#39;s just that maids don&#39;t know anything about my business; they&#39;d throw away the necessary files. But since you work with me, as my secretary, you have better knowledge.&#34; He sat down on his beloved seat again. Seriously, why doesn&#39;t he just glue his ass to that fucking chair of his?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh wow! How thoughtful of you sir!&#34; I began walking back towards his door and continued, &#34;And since I&#39;m done with your &#39;cleaning work&#39; and it&#39;s time for me to leave for my house, goodbye!&#34; I banged his door as hard as I could, took my bag from my cabin, and took a taxi home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was desperately in need of some coffee; thanks to Mr. Reynolds and his split personalities which had annoyed the shit out of me.</p>
