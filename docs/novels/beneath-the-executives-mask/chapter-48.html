                <p>I saw a photo frame next to the bed, I took a grip of it at once. My eyes widened extensively on the view --It had Mr. Ashton along with his wife, his hands rested on his wife&#39;s right shoulders. There was a man who rested his hands on Mrs. Reynold&#39;s left shoulders, it was my dad. My grip over the picture loosened up but I at once caught it tightly so as to prevent it from breaking into pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s the man who visits him and pays his bills&#34;, the nurse pointed at my father&#39;s picture. &#34;Now if you&#39;re done investigating, I suppose you should leave &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I take the picture along? &#34;, I somewhere knew the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not allowed to. Besides, this is the only belonging of this man which can make him remember his identity when he wakes up. I apologize &#34;, she flung his hand towards the door signaling me to walk out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind was not only distracted at this moment but it also emerged a lot of negative thoughts within itself. My father definitely was somehow connected to the &#39;Reynolds &#39;. Suddenly, flashbacks crossed my mind from the very day I saw My father&#39;s name in his telephone directory to that day in the car when Mr. Reynolds told us we had a history .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was certainly convinced that we definitely didn&#39;t have some good family history and I now I understood the purpose of me, being employed as his secretary as his holy motive would be to torture me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the elevator as quickly after browsing his room once again as I could as I wanted to inform him that his father is upstairs so that he could pay him a visit. I knew that this action of mine will either lead to positive consequences or vice-versa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On reaching the floor, I outstretched my legs forwardly towards Mr. Reynolds&#39;s hospital room. My eyeballs didn&#39;t catch his sight so I took a view around, being unable to locate him I sat on his bed resting my back over the mountains of the super fluffy pillows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tore the packets of chips which was in the mini-fridge closer to the right side of the bed and ate it crunching them with my teeth. I loved the noise so every time I ate one I made sure that the voice grew louder but what I liked about this 5-star room was that everything was available in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I see a stalker &#34;, Mr. Reynolds changed the uniform outfit of this place, he wore a loose pink shirt which exposed all of his body, it was light cotton in material and turned my heart heavy making me want to stargaze all day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh -oh &#34;, I threw the packet of chips, actually his voice hit my reflex so it was not something I wanted to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down your nerves Miss Waters, I won&#39;t crunch you down &#34;, he had an amused expression which definitely gave me a clear picture of his mood. &#34;So why are you here again ?&#34;, he interrogated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh Damn, I was so enchanted with the packet of chips that I totally forgot the purpose of me being here. &#34;I was a-a j-just I-I &#34;, I stammered as I couldn&#39;t really phrase up my sentence. I was scared of the consequence plus excited for him to see his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must have tried to keep in touch with him but maybe would&#39;ve failed to trace him. I didn&#39;t know the family drama because at this instance I was concerned about knowing my father&#39;s role in their story which I&#39;ll eventually find out through my mother hopefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S-Speak Miss Waters &#34;, he tried mimicking me keeping up with the smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned &#34;I know you&#39;re not going to be satisfied with what I&#39;m going to tell you right now but I&#39;ll say it anyway &#34;, I looked away turning my back towards his face because this way it would be easier &#34;I saw your father today, he&#39;s upstairs. He isn&#39;t physically and mentally stable. I suppose you should pay him a visit .&#34; I didn&#39;t hear anything, silence plastered the atmosphere so I further continued &#34;I found a friendly picture of your parents with my father too, maybe they are acquainted &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cornered my eyes to take a gist of the atmosphere through the outcome of my words. Mr. Reynolds stood there calm, silent, and shocked. As soon as my eyes met his, he rushed towards me pinning me on the wall, taking grip over my arms violently. His actions were hurting me as well as the irrevocable wounds of mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the fuck did you go upstairs &#34;, he pushed me back towards the wall when I tried to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear I didn&#39;t intend to &#34;, I knew I was going to be in trouble but never imagined to this extent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Miss Waters, I don&#39;t believe in your ugly swears . &#34;, his eyes were cold and turned a shade dark by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need answers, why is my father with your parents. Why don&#39;t you visit him ever and why do you fail to attend all of the hospital&#39;s calls regarding your father? &#34;, I looked straight in his eyes covering up my fearfulness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because he fucking deserves this place, because he fucking deserves to stay insane &#34;, he pinched my arms with his hands causing me irresistible pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I don&#39;t fucking deserve to be treated this way and most importantly work for you as your secretary &#34;, I used the same cuss words . &#34;now I understand why you appointed me at first place&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t matter, you&#39;re already bound to work with me. You&#39;re legally in a contract with me, just so you remember &#34;, tears flew through my eyes, I wanted to act strong but I failed. The man I thought had changed a bit regained his original devilish nature, the man I almost made out with fails to even call me by my first name. I had this super cute illusion of mine which was now turning into an ugly reality check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we going ?&#34;, he loosened his grip from me and pulled me vigorously towards the door. &#34;I am not willing to come with you wherever &#34;, I stated whilst being exerted by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re heading home &#34;, this only three words escaped his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were now in the parking area, I was yet in the hospital&#39;s uniform. He let go off his grip over me, a small bruise appeared on my wrist because of being lugged by Inhumans. I blew air with my mouth over the bruise to stop the burning pain, there was no result though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>2 black BMW&#39;s came towards our direction, a man properly-suited opened the door for Mr. Reynolds, he at once took his seat. I tried getting in but I was stopped &#34;Not with me Miss, we&#39;ve already had our quality time. You can take the car at the back &#34;, I peeped him through the glass, he turned the pages of the economic times to study the market&#39;s fluctuations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed the car&#39;s door which flung open with my legs out of annoyance. He didn&#39;t dare to look away from his newspaper. I thumped my legs as I walked through the car and took the back-seat at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laid over the seat as there was no one in the car except for me and the driver. I closed my eyes trying to forget about today but my mind redirected me towards the picture I found in Mr. Ashton&#39;s room. Both the cars took off together, I decided to stay still and have a nap till I reach home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up to the deafening horn of the car. The driver was doing that on purpose to wake me so I gave him a frowning shut-up-or-I&#39;ll-kill-you look. He stopped immediately as I woke up. I banged the door making sure he realized my annoyance and walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the door slowly as it was dark already. &#34;Mom, I&#39;m home &#34;, I yelled out of my lungs making my voice echo at this peak time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My baby &#34;, Mom rushed instinctively from her room, and teddy hugged me &#34;How was your trip, love &#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trip? &#34;, I questioned pinpointing the last word of her sentence. Mom looked shocked at my reaction too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, the trip. The trip was one of the best trips ever. I learned so much, gave me life lessons. Worth my time &#34;, I remembered about the text message that James sent making my kidnap look like a business trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to eat something and why are these marks and bruises all over your body ? &#34;, She looked concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Had a little accident. No, I ate something during my way home so I&#39;m full. Thanks &#34;, I lied in both my answers. &#34;I&#39;m sleepy. Goodnight&#34;, I kissed my mom on her forehead avoiding all her questions and went upstairs to my room, pouncing on the bed after freshening up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s your coffee &#34;, its been three days now, I haven&#39;t left my room yet. I never felt like to step my toes out of my room. Mom gets me breakfast every morning, I walk down for lunch and skip dinner every night. The painful flashbacks keep striking me regardless of how much I tried to divert my mind watching Nicholas Sparks&#39;s movies over and over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, I need to ask you a question &#34;, I stuffed the first layer of pancakes, gulping it with orange juice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring it on &#34;, Mom nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is dad familiar with Ashton Reynolds ?&#34;, I kept my point straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. Amanda, you don&#39;t need to know about that. You really don&#39;t &#34;, she looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to. Please &#34;, I convinced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I don&#39;t really want to get into it in detail &#34;, Mom took a deep breath &#34; I am not sure about it but I guess your father cheated on me with Ashton&#39;s wife, he was Ashton&#39;s best friend at one time but then considering this fact I guess my doubt on him was irrelevant. My story on him is just what I assumed back then, its not confidential .&#34;, I furrowed my brows out of confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Dad said, he was not interested in you anymore. He wanted to spend his life with someone of the same gender as he claimed himself pansexual &#34;, I wasn&#39;t much satisfied with mom&#39;s answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did tell you that I have less idea of your father&#39;s life. He never really talked to me about his personal life &#34;, She sighed so I kept my hand on hers giving her comfort, &#34;All I can say is that Ashton, Emily, and your father had something in between, something very dark and violent .&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no&#34;, I covered my mouth with my hands symbolizing shock &#34;Which means there&#39;s something dark between our families which made Mr. Reynolds what he is today, which makes him hate me more than what I deserve &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did want to warn you before entering that office but I also didn&#39;t want to keep you in the bars. I wanted to see you strong and confident, I guess I failed &#34;, a tear traveled through mom&#39;s cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, You always win mom. You made a week little girl, a strong woman today &#34;, I engulfed mom into a hug and ended the topic right away as of now I decided the ices to take the shape as per the container which means that let the situation go as it is going.</p>
