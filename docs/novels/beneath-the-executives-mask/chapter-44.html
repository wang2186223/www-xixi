                <p>He held me through the waist and uplifted himself showing great courage. His current situation weakened me a bit, a tear rolled through my eyes realizing the pain he had been feeling lately. I turned my head around and wiped the tears dry so that he couldn&#39;t notice . &#34;does your head hurts too much?&#34;, he did see my tears but just didn&#39;t realize what were they for;</p>

                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t too but being a girl I&#39;m trying to. You are superior to me and yet you&#39;re so discouraged&#34;, I tried faking out pointing straight on his manhood ego.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t judge my patience&#34;, he scowled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am &#34; I pulled him again. His body was slow as compared, it felt like I was carrying some kid who was late to school and didn&#39;t really want to attend school but his mother which was me was forcing him too. &#34;don&#39;t sleep &#34;, I slapped him on his face slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened instinctively to my action &#34;You&#39;re crossing limits. Definitely. &#34;, he started from a high pitch but slowly his pitch reduced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We almost reached near the highway, his legs were shaking while he walked, they didn&#39;t have the strength to move forward. His courage and determination enlightened me and definitely gave me big life lessons. &#34;Can&#39;t walk anymore, take a pause &#34;, he interrupted the silence .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re right where our destination is &#34;, I consoled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;stop. what the fuck. Stop &#34;, I ran in front of the nearest car making sure Mr. Reynolds stood nicely. The car driver shifted the steering wheel in a rightward position avoiding me. I raised my middle finger in air clear enough for him to see me in his side mirrors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How the hell do we get outside this &#34;&#39;, I frowned. &#34;Maybe I have an idea &#34;, I pulled my dress downwards showing some of my cleavage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such cheap stunt is not going to work &#34;, his facial expressions showed fifty shades of his annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop judging, let me show you how it works &#34;, I winked and moved forward loosening up my hair turning it sexy. I stopped by and signaled the nearest car whose driver was around his mid 20&#39;s. He ceased to drive any more after my hand signal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, sexy! , looks like you need a lift &#34;, he unfastened his seat belt and pushed the door to have a word with me. His face was tanned, his black eyes shined brightly. His shirt fitted perfectly showing his well-toned gym body, I could see his cuts in his transparent shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned towards Mr. Reynolds raising my brows giving him a -see-I-nailed-it kind of look. &#34;I have a man with me, do you probably mind?&#34;, I questioned faking out the sweetest smile I could ever give.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He examined Mr. Reynolds carefully from head to toe, let me say he was not really in a presentable situation. &#34;I apologize sweetheart but I can&#39;t take the man along &#34;, he took my hands and gave a small peck before turning around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not ?&#34;, Mr. Reynolds interrogated with the man in his bossy nature. He looked gentle enough to smile at him before the start of communication rather than offending. He marched towards him slowly without uttering a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry brother. Seems like you&#39;re in great trouble but I can&#39;t get myself in trouble too along with. I can make out from your situation that this is going to be a police case sooner or later. I really don&#39;t want to involve myself in this drama, I&#39;ve been bailed out from jail for the third time this month. My dad has warned me that if I happen to get in trouble with police any sooner from the last bail, he&#39;ll take away the love of my life&#34;, he pointed towards the car &#34; he warned me that he&#39;ll take away this car of mine&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhmm &#34; Mr. Reynolds cleared his throat &#34; Aston Martin Vanquish, I must say you have a pretty amazing choice &#34;, I never knew Mr. Reynolds was in cars too. He wiped off the sleepy tears from his face so that he could have a better word with the passerby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Thanks, bro &#34;, he grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about a Lamborghini Aventador Coupe?&#34;, I knew exactly where this conversation was going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I completely love it, man, certainly in my &#39;to buy &#39; list &#34;, I could sense his excitement for the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Write to me your number and address as a text message on the number I am going to give you. Consider the car is yours, will be delivered to you at your doorstep&#34;, he chuckled maintaining the bossy attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whats the price for it cause I am willing to do anything then&#34;, he was instigated by his offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave me this car here since you&#39;re not keen to drive&#34;, he wasn&#39;t able to drive too so maybe he should&#39;ve been a bit pushy with this anon guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do I trust you?&#34;, he inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Aaron Reynolds just so the name helps plus this offer is something an ordinary person cannot give in exchange for such. It&#39;s a win-win situation as I&#39;ll return you this car too. Find yourself some traveling conveyance now without wasting my time &#34;, he started to cough. He caught his chest tightly. I quickly ran towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then gave me a You-don&#39;t -know -to-nail-it look through his evil smirk. He had this ideology that money could buy everything which was proving out to be true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The anonymous guy almost vanished as he kept walking. I pushed him up and made his way towards the car. &#34;Drive &#34;, he commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said drive, can&#39;t you hear that, now please don&#39;t tell me that you don&#39;t know to drive &#34;, his question had a portion of his answer too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did learn driving but never got the confidence to practice my skills on the road &#34;, I cleared myself as I didn&#39;t want him to consider me a pedo. &#34;I do know to drive but like I said I don&#39;t really have the confidence. It can risk our lives &#34;, I continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our lives are in risk already &#34;, he completed my statement after auto-correcting it. &#34;I&#39;ll guide you, don&#39;t worry &#34;, he took the passenger seat quickly after I comforted myself on the driver one. I pulled my seat belt and inter locked it quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw Mr. Reynolds with cornered eyes, his focus was towards the road through the front view mirror. This was one of the days when I was not mad at him for being stubborn or rude, I just wanted to hear about his well-being as time was flying and his situation was becoming critical. I pushed away my seat belt as I was feeling choked because of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way towards him, the car was small so I just had to give a small push to my body. I hopped out of my seat to wrap the seat belt across him ensuring his safety. Our nose almost touched, I could hear his heavy breathing. Our eyes met, it was difficult to break the contact but I managed it somehow . &#34;You&#39;re going to make through this , okay ?&#34; , I rhetorically questioned cupping my hands in his cheeks whilst giving him a small peck on his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m no kid Miss Waters &#34;, I realized that I was a bit more carried away in emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry &#34;, I got back to my seat giving a full stop to my sympathy. &#34; This car looks different than what I learned from &#34;, I analyzed the car. The car did look different but not complicated , I could understand what the parts were meant for . I just faked the drama so that Mr Reynolds could keep himself engaged in explaining and prevent himself from sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed in the clutch all the way while turning the key and selected the first gear to set off. &#34;I feel so tired already. Maybe I die on the way but ---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;shush &#34;, I cut him off</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me speak, I give you the responsibility to complete Pallapora town&#39;s project which is carried in my mother&#39;s name &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not going anywhere. We are going to the nearest hospital to do your check-up. You will be fine, okay? &#34;, I looked away from him &#34;Fine enough to harass me till the contract actually ends. &#34;, I smiled to cover up the sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slightly pressed the accelerator pedal using the ball of your right foot to increase the engine revs. Looking at the rev counter, I pressed the accelerator until the revs reach approximately 1500 rpm. This provided the engine with power enabling the car to move. I took charge of the steering confidently and moved accordingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Mr. Reynolds, you awake ?&#34;, he was silent for a while so I guessed that he might have taken a quick nap. I couldn&#39;t break my focus whilst driving so I looked straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;mmhmm, you always interrupt me when I am about to sleep. You&#39;re paying for this once we return back &#34;, his sleepy condition also was stubborn and demanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just shut up. You are not supposed to sleep. Tell me about the things you love&#34;, I tried distracting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not love anything or anyone rather than myself&#34;, his answer was expected and quick so I couldn&#39;t even give it a pull by re-questioning</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me what do you feel about me or my driving&#34;, This question popped out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re sick, stubborn, clumsy &#34; he paused &#34;annoying but an amazing human being Miss Waters. Everything about you is so different, I have met and fucked a lot of girls but you - &#34; now he was carried away and I was enjoying his confessions &#34;You could be special to me in a good way but you&#39;re special to me in a nasty way &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We never had a good history&#34;, I continued sighing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No ! the police complaint and the dog accident are not just 2 times when we&#39;ve met in the past . We&#39;ve been connected for a long time. You don&#39;t even have any idea about it. Your father was---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was utterly shocked by the fact that Mr. Reynolds knew my father personally. Flashbacks played in my mind of the day when I discovered my father&#39;s name on his telephone directory marked with red ink. I knew that he was a trouble for me because of some reason and now I wanted to know the reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father was ? he was what? tell me?&#34;, I questioned continuously but got no answer, when I looked towards him I saw that he already fainted. I stopped the car at once, his body was turning cold making my world turn upside down.</p>
