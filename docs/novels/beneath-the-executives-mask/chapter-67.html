                <p>&#34;Have them &#34;, he read the timetable through the chart the doctor has made. Picking out the relevant medicines, he handed them to me &#34;how do you feel ?&#34;, he questioned again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In lo---&#34;, Oh no-no. How do I change the topic now &#34;In a lot of better &#34;, he looked at me perplexed, my sentence was awfully confusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay!&#34; he exclaimed as he took a seat next to me on the bed. He did keep some distance in between.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Mr. Caleb &#34;, he raised himself up and shook his hands with the detective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, good morning &#34;, I greeted cheerfully. If only I&#39;d known he was going to come then I&#39;d change into a lot more decent outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here is the note and the handkerchief, he left last night &#34;, he handed the clues to Mr. Caleb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He examined them one after the other, he also looked at my wound closely. I am glad my top was sleeveless so I didn&#39;t have to push my sleeve down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The signs which he is showing emphasizes the fact that he has something big and dirty planned against you both &#34;, he cleared his throat and continued &#34;The word trailer as per my knowledge means that whatever he did was very small to something which he has planned. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped as my eyes widened &#34;He did tell me that he was going to lead me to a slow painful death . His sentence also included Mr. Reynolds&#39;s name &#34;, I looked in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This case is getting complicated day by day. I&#39;ve already assigned his picture to the local cops around. They&#39;ve started their search for him. I suggest you&#39;ll to leave this place and get back to your city--&#34;, Mr. Reynolds cut his sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not leaving this place because of him. I&#39;ll call my driver and allow Miss Waters to go home with him &#34;, he rubbed his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not leaving anywhere without you &#34;, I made a decision. I couldn&#39;t just save my life and let him be in danger. I knew James and I also was aware of how dangerous he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well then let me allocate some bodyguards for your safety. They won&#39;t interrupt you, they&#39;ll just watch from space and keep assuring me about your well-being &#34;, Mr. Caleb looked more of a police and less of a detective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his hands with both of us again and left the room. &#34;Who is he ?&#39;, I inquired about him for the second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A retired police officer but that doesn&#39;t matter &#34;.</p>

                <p>&#34;We have heard about the progress of Pallapora&#39;s town redevelopment program , that really created an urge in us to do business with you&#34;, Mr Reynolds smiled as Mr Henry praised him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tightened his tie &#34;I am glad you liked my work . I make sure to do it with perfection every time &#34;, his lips gave birth to a small smile and he continued &#34;I went through the town and I am quite convinced by its ethereal beauty&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s really a compliment for this small city &#34;, Mr Henry along with his group of associates started discussing about the do&#39;s and don&#39;t of the project . I wasn&#39;t really interested in their crappy business talks so I decided to make the most of my time aka stare at the guy I was crushing on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time I had an eye contact with him , I&#39;d focus my attention towards the wall which was behind him. Maybe I should tell him about my feelings or maybe I shouldn&#39;t. There was a tsunami of mixed thoughts which were confusing my already confused mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Waters, what is your opinion regarding this topic?&#34;, Mr Reynolds cocked his brow as he looked straight in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t really focusing at the question at first place so I had a blank expression plus I couldn&#39;t ask him to pardon the sentence &#34;Whatever your opinion is&#34;, I felt it the most relevant answer at the moment. I knew it was very dumb of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On hearing some people giggle I glanced at them , they stopped the very moment when they analyzed me eyeing them. I frowned at my own stupidity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I attentively heard the rest of the discussion and even asked relevant questions so as to cover up from my previous blonde behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So , we can wrap up the work by tomorrow afternoon and leave instinctively then &#34;, Mr Reynolds sighed . A part of me was happy to leave the place as it had been troublesome for me since we initiated the journey but the other part was sad because I was actually enjoying my time with Mr Reynolds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry but I guess you&#39;ll have to re-schedule the whole back-to-home plan&#34;, Cody interrupted .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we have a special masquerade ball arranged for tomorrow night . We are celebrating our hotel&#39;s 100th anniversary and we&#39;ll be honored if you could enlighten us with your presence &#34;, Mr Henry sounded so pushy .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be delighted to attend the same&#34;, Mr Reynolds accepted his invitation . I stood at one corner simply playing with my hair as no one really included me in their conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People started leaving the conference room one by one. I followed Mr Reynolds while he exited . We didn&#39;t talk, just walked . Leading our path he strolled towards a place which wasn&#39;t our room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey wait--&#34;, I tried stopping him .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we heading to ?&#34;, I questioned as I matched his speed . He halted for a while and paid attention to my dress before answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The garden&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The garden?&#34;, I was bewildered as he definitely didn&#39;t seem the type of guy to relax in the garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Am I not allowed there?&#34; he interrogated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course you are&#34;, I let him take the head again . I tried to avoid the thumping noise my sandal made on interaction with the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On reaching the garden he settled himself on the bench so I took the seat next to him . The place was the most liveliest throughout . Small kids were playing around, oldies had their whole different laughter club . I knew as I read the board which was placed in the area they sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight was dim , the breeze was cold . I tried not to react to it . &#34;I wish I could go back to my childhood&#34;, I looked at those kids who played and laughed carelessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I am better like this&#34;, I knew he had a rough history . I knew some part of it but I never tried digging out the whole story .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you just say better? Better which is the comparative form of good ? &#34;, I tried amusing him by mixing brows. I changed the topic because whenever the topic of childhood popped in , his face turned low and disconsolate . I shouldn&#39;t have started the topic at first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled on my statement but didn&#39;t answer. No one among us spoke for a while, silence spoke . &#34;When I first met you &#34;, I interrogated the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmhmm?&#34;, he inquired .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were a bad man , you aren&#39;t actually . You try to be hard. I don&#39;t know why &#34;, I shrugged &#34;But you&#39;re a good man Mr Reynolds , to be precise you&#39;re one of the best man I have ever met&#34;, I confessed a part of my feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not very close to or acquainted with good . I -I &#34;, he stammered like he wanted to say me something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You?&#34; I tried asking him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing&#34;, he cut my sentence . What was it though? I knew that this was one of his statements I had to enter in my book of &#39;unanswered questions&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay&#34;, I didn&#39;t engulf him into the topic as it was irrelevant. I was well aware of his stubborn nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;hey there love-birds&#34;, Cody sauntered towards us with a man who held him by his waist . I could figure it easily that they were into each other. To be honest their pair looked cute, very cute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see ha&#34;, I winked at Cody . He blushed at my expression and introduced us with the man he accompanied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meet David, my boyfriend&#34;, I stood up and hugged David in a friendly way . Mr Reynolds shook his hands without burdening his sitting position. Cody&#39;s eyes twinkled with joy in finding his partner.</p>
