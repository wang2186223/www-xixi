                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t break my ear walls with such loud music and simply irritate me, I didn&#39;t stop you when you played but then you had to increase the volume. Now cope up with the consequences of it &#34;, he didn&#39;t look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-but I love Ed Sheeran and his music so much, the volume was pretty low as compared with the basic volume we put when I and my friend&#39;s go for a ride &#34;, I tried to convince him knowing the fact that he won&#39;t change his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, If you don&#39;t play the music then I&#39;ll sing &#34;, I cleared my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You utter a word and you&#39;re out of my car, this road is pretty much empty all the time. You won&#39;t even get a lift &#34;, he warned. I didn&#39;t sing obviously as I was scared that he may actually mean what he just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned towards the back seat squatting as I disconnected the seat belt. I opened the chain of my bag as I only carried my clutch till the front seat. I turned my eyeballs towards the left to have a quick view of Mr. Reynolds. He had an I-dont-know-what-the-fuck-she-is-doing expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Collecting my pack of pringles, I hopped towards the front seat again. I liked eating during drives, it always enlightened my mood. I decided to offer it to Mr. Reynolds so I pushed the pack towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you stay still and sane for even 10 minutes &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can, I choose not to &#34;, I smiled awkwardly. &#34;So I am guessing you&#39;re not hungry &#34;, I placed my pringles on my lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scrunched as I ate one after the other. His face didn&#39;t really look subtle so I scrunched a bit louder &#34;Miss Wateeeeeeeers &#34;, he shouted banging at the steering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Reynolds &#34;, my voice was soft and calm as compared to him. Watching his annoyed face made me happy, he looked cute when he raised or furrowed his brows. Okay, he didn&#39;t look cute but very hot instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So can I play the music now, I swear I won&#39;t dance and keep the volume low ?&#39; &#34;, I broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And ?&#34;, he cocked his brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what ?&#34;, I didn&#39;t understand what he really meant &#34;Oh, yes! I won&#39;t sing too. Definitely not &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine &#34;, he permitted me to play the music. I decided to keep the genre slow, so I clicked on my romantic playlist and tapped the shuffle button as I was very bored to switch different songs time by time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was &#39;Cry with you&#39; by Hunter Hayes, the song always got me emotional. No, I didn&#39;t sing as whenever my lips parted a small flashback of his warning traveled across my mind. The rest of the journey was very quiet, I didn&#39;t utter a single word. I kept myself entertained with the slow music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking outside the window always paved the ways for various innumerable thoughts. Currently, the hottest topic I liked to think about was Mr. Reynolds. What if we ended up together? What if we never ended up together? I knew our situation wasn&#39;t perfect or normal and we were not really &#39;Made for each other types&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed my baby hair behind my ears and tried thinking about some different topics. I tried diverting my mind and welcomed thoughts which included everyone but Mr. Reynolds. Suddenly, I felt a tingle in my stomach. It felt heavy. I knew that I was in the urge of the washroom as I needed to pee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gathered all my guts to speak to him about it. But how exactly should I frame my sentence? I want to pee. No, that&#39;ll be to straight and awkward. Maybe, if I replaced the need with want then the sentence will sound a bit better . I need to pee, it didn&#39;t sound right too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Come on Amanda, you&#39;re acting like he doesn&#39;t pee at all. Tell him to take a halt in the nearest city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Reynolds &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing &#34;, I felt really shy. It was never difficult when I was with Francis, I could do anything in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Reynolds &#34;, I called him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For the second time, Yes Miss Waters&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you take a halt when you spot some hotel along the way, please? &#34;, I made a puppy dog face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why ?&#39;, he always had to question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to go to the restroom &#34;, I looked towards the window as I was embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay &#34;, he replied as he continued driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After reaching some decent hotel, he parked the car and directed me to go. He exited the car too but didn&#39;t really walk by my side. I asked the lady who worked there to guide me towards the washroom. She pleasantly smiled at me and directed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t see Mr. Reynolds anywhere around, maybe he was having lunch around or maybe he was freshening himself up too. I washed my face with water whilst looking at the mirror in the washroom after releasing the water of my stomach which embarrassed the heck out of me. I corrected my eyeliner as I gave a touch up to my lips as well with my gloss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After satisfying myself that I look presentable, I marched out of the washroom as it really haunted me to stay alone in a place for a long time. I did believe in ghosts and life after death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amaaaaandaa &#34;, my name echoed around. I turned around towards the direction where it came from, it sounded familiar. Very familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I figured out a man with a long loose coat and thigh-high boots, he had a beanie around his head which covered his hair. I followed him as he didn&#39;t stop. He just kept walking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, mister &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know my name ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait for me &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I triggered a set of innumerable questions at the unknown who now took longer steps. He placed a short note on the ground and ran away. His image disappeared, I did try to cope up with his speed but I failed. One thing was pretty clear that whoever the person was, he knew that we were far away from the city. He was either tracing us through the mobile network or following us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I collected the note which was placed by him on the ground, it was neatly folded 3 times. I dusted it before unfolding it. It almost slipped off my hand when I read the message which was written over it. My thinking power collapsed and my heart almost plummeted on the floor and later regained its original position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The note read :</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m back, stay cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>love</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\-J.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a while to get back to my senses, I sat on my knees with the note. After gathering courage, I stood up and walked back towards where I left off. My legs shook resulting in an unbalanced walk, I was scared. Very scared. I took longer steps, twice that of my original speed as I hurriedly marched towards Mr. Reynolds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds sat on a chair peacefully, his table was surrounded by delicious food. The atmosphere around was quite lively, tables and chairs were placed in open space. On stumbling towards his table, I quickly stiffened myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sipped his coffee after taking a bite of his sandwich &#34;What&#39;s wrong &#34;. He did figure things from my facial expressions, it clearly showed my anxiousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;th-this &#34;, I stammered. I handed him the note I collected from the ground. My eyes turned heavy as I gently rubbed my head which pained. My vision blurred due to the formation of tears &#34;He will definitely kill us this t-time &#34;, I rubbed off the tear which flicked through my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He won&#39;t, I&#39;ll make sure. Stop crying like a baby Miss Waters &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s dangerous &#34;, I remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree but definitely not more than me, you have to agree to that &#34;, he winked as he tried to assure me. His words were consoling, it felt like ice to the burn I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled slightly trying to forget about James &#34; Should we head back home ?&#34;, I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aaron Reynolds never leaves a deal incomplete &#34;, he buttoned his blazer from the middle &#34;Now will you eat ?&#34;, he questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to, I don&#39;t feel like &#34;, I rejected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t ask you, I commanded you . &#34;, he placed a spoon in my hand. The table was filled with delicacies which included sandwiches .pizza&#39;s, pasta&#39;s, pancakes, and flavored corns. I knew he ordered light less oily food on purpose because we had a long journey to travel. I filled a spoon with pasta and stuffed it in my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t really feel like eating, my stomach was filled with terror already. I stuffed some spoons of pasta and gulped it with Pepsi. On completing our meal, we walked back towards the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the journey was silent, I kept my eyes closed so as to disallow all the negativity to trespass my mind. I woke up to a push on my shoulder &#34; We arrived at our destination, wake up&#34;, I brushed my hair back and settled my clothes and face through the rearview mirror before exiting the car.</p>
