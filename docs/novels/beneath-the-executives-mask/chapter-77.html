                <p>&#34;Oh , didn&#39;t mean to surprise you Mr Aaron . I decided to call you with your first name considering the fact that this is not your office premises which basically means that you&#39;re not my boss here &#34; I paused &#34;, plus, I called you Mr Reynolds out of respect but because I don&#39;t respect you anymore , maybe I should stop calling you that way &#34;, I stated the truth .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pinched &#39;level 2&#39; and rested his back on one corner of the elevator after placing me down . His eyes traveled through my body , from head to toe. After reaching the desired level , he guided us out . I tried preventing myself from making undesirable facial expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That way &#34;, he pointed towards the corner-most room of the floor. The walls threw a shade of mint along with off white . I could only see 3 rooms on this floor , I had an intuition that he would allot me a room closest to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened in surprise on reaching the room he allocated me . The windows were huge , surrounded with velvet curtains . In the middle, was a king-sized fluffy bed concealed with white sheets and soft pillows . The luxury he was providing me could win anyone&#39;s heart but why didn&#39;t it cause any change in my views regarding him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried my best to unhate him, if only that&#39;s a word in dictionary but every time I diverted my mind by favoring him , his words echoed in my eyes . The past can never be changed or erased but only be accepted but why couldn&#39;t I accept him ?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look , please . Take me home , I miss my family so much . Mom will be so worried for me &#34;, I explained him in a calmer tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t react to my sentence but instead removed his phone and made a call . After making sure that the phone connected , he kept it on speaker mode . &#34;Hey Mr Reynolds , how are you ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh , what was wrong with my mom . Her tone was so sweet and pleasant whilst talking with this man . To my amazement , she didn&#39;t ask about my well-being but his . You&#39;re my mom , don&#39;t talk with this stubborn introverted human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine Mrs Waters , Amanda wants to have a word with you &#34;, he shrugged passing the phone in my direction .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey mom , I miss you so much &#34;, it felt light after talking with someone I trusted . It felt , that for a while all my pains were taken away .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I got this call , I was scared . On hearing the bell this hour of the night forced my mind to think negative stuff but I knew that my daughter was safe there , with Mr Reynolds . We had a talk earlier regarding your safety and it&#39;s best that you stay with him . He cares for you so much , could be seen through the way he talked with me regarding you &#34;, Mom sighed through the other side .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing my attention towards the phone , I ignored Mr Reynolds completely . &#34;Maybe , I&#39;ll talk to you tomorrow . Sleep well, sweet dreams. Love you , Mom &#34;, I canceled the phone bidding mom good bye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did the villain turn into a hero now?&#34;, he arched his brows .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No &#34;, I pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But your mom&#39;s on my side &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s my mom ,not yours. You say mom like she&#39;s yours &#34;, I made an air quotation with my fingers , &#34; I&#39;m sleepy &#34;, I faked a yawn closing my eyes . I acted as an attempt to push him away from the room , from my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just a door away , in case you require anything &#34;, he looked at me one last time and exited the door carefully turning the door knob .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey -hey Mr Reynolds &#34;, he turned around ,&#34;I mean Aaron ,only Aaron &#34;, I pinched myself secretly on my stupid behavior ,&#34;you left your phone with me &#34;, he marched in again , took possession of his phone at once. Our hands collided , I abruptly pulled my hands away from him and sat on the bed with crossed legs. I eyed his stiff back till he exited the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I settled my back on the fluffy bed, covered myself with the sheets and closed my eyes. A tear rolled through my eyes and got absorbed in the pillow. I never felt this helpless before . Every time I looked at Mr Reynolds , I felt helpless. A tsunami of mixed emotions drifted across my heart and mind .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;good morning beautiful &#34;, a red haired lady woke me up . I rubbed my eyes to have a clearer view of the lady after realizing that it was morning already. She was well dressed , she placed the trolley filled with food closer to my bed. &#34;You-uh . Oh My God , you&#39;re here &#34;, I opened my mouth in response to her unexpected entry .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Red -aunt , if I ain&#39;t mistaken . Never got an opportunity to inquire about your name in the past &#34;, I outstretched my arms to give up on my sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Rosaline , I&#39;m comfortable with Red Aunt though ! &#34;, she stretched her lips pleasantly .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed the tray of food on the bed carefully ,&#34;I thought he expelled you &#34;, I furrowed my brows in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even I thought the same but sometimes things don&#39;t happen how we expect them to be . There&#39;s a major difference between what we see and what exactly the truth is . He did expel me that day but then admitted me as this house&#39;s caretaker . He provides me shelter to live and also backs me up monetarily.Back then , I had an ideology that he didn&#39;t care about the person who took care of her in the past &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmhmm ?&#34;, I nodded waiting for her to complete the rest of her story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In fact he cared too much about me , he knew that I wouldn&#39;t be able to rest or relax in the office so he admitted me here . I am very happy with my working conditions , I just have to assist the fellow workers here without really burdening myself&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh &#34;, I exclaimed as I didn&#39;t expect such greatness from him , to be honest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not a bad man Amanda , he just masks himself as a bad man in front of every one &#34; , she mixed sugar in the cup of tea and passed the cup to me .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took small sips after taking the cup in my hands , &#34;How do you know my name ?&#34;, I questioned raising my brows .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because he specifically mentioned your name and commanded me to take special care of you &#34;, a small smile took birth on my lips .I tightened them as I didn&#39;t want Rosaline to know about my feelings for him , whatever they were .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hate and love were constantly having a battle , hate was overcoming all the love I had for him. I turned my phone on and sent a message on the group chat so as to enlighten my mood. No one was online by now , so I switched it off and placed it on the table again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosaline examined every move of mine carefully &#34;I don&#39;t really feel like eating anything , I&#39;m okay with tea, thanks &#34;, she kissed my cheek softly and exited the room . She left the food on the trolley guiding me to eat it whenever I felt hungry. I watched her leave my room .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he wasn&#39;t really a bad man . Today , I discovered something really unexpected about him . If I didn&#39;t have an encounter with Mrs Rosaline then I would&#39;ve mistook his image wrong, for lifetime probably . Who was he and why wasn&#39;t I able to unleash the true Aaron Reynolds.</p>
