                <p>&#34;Which dress?&#34; Gina inquired, raising both the hangers in the air at the same time. They both looked fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That one has too much exposure of skin.&#34; I made an instinct reaction on pointing at the dress which she displayed with her right hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A bit of cleavage is no harm for a sexy girl like you&#34;, Gina immediately cut my words then continued &#34;How about this second one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I eyed the collection of dresses she brought for me, but to my discontent, I didn&#39;t like any.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come naked then!&#34; Gina frowned, irritation could be sensed in her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t do this to me&#34;, I tried to make up for spoiling her mood by side hugging her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gina was such a sweetheart. She came with all her belongings at my place so that we could get ready for the party together. Let me mention, she had an amazing choice in makeup, it was all authentic and trending. I loved her so much, I wish I could express that to her. Yet, I was too dreadful at expressing my feelings for the people I loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, so what kind of dress would you like to wear Ammie?&#34; She questioned, furrowing her brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her and the collection of dresses she possessed. I tried examining each dress one by one but to my discontent, I couldn&#39;t find any which suited up to my expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gina picked up a red knee-length dress which had a covered neck but included a deep cut, alongside the shoulders, down to the arms. It showed off some amount of skin, which looked amazing, giving it a close yet, modern touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes! This looks perfect. I&#39;ll wear this.&#34; I finally decided after grabbing it from Gina&#39;s hands, adjusting the dress on myself in front of the mirror by suspending it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear if you would&#39;ve taken any longer, I would have left without you because it&#39;s already 6:15&#34;, she pointed towards her wristwatch, making a statement offending my nasty behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We quickly put on our respectable dresses. Gina wore a pink body fit dress which could clearly show some of her cleavage. She looked bomb, let me say that. We helped each other with makeup, thanks to those inspirational YouTubers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allow me to say that Gina did make me look different. Her makeup skills were no less than a professional. Her winged liner and everything was so perfect and on point. I, when tried putting on a winged liner always ended smudging my eyes black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I side-parted all my hair in one position and kept them open after applying the serum. Gina tied a messy bun which complimented her dress so much. We both took a mandatory selfie before leaving for the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We could clearly hear the horn of a car beeping. We ran towards the main door. We knew it was Francis. He wore a grey leather jacket over a white &#34;v&#34; necked t-shirt which showed his amazing and well-built body. He looked stunning, to be honest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waved us from the car grinning with all his teeth. I knew he was showing off because he was traveling in some latest Porsche. Francis had a rich and well-known family background. He was always urging to help me but I did not want money and self-respect to collide along with each other as the consequences could directly vary with our friendship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both took the back seat quickly. Francis was on the passenger seat with his driver. &#34;You guys look so intimidating. I&#39;m proud to enter the party with such hot ladies, people want one and I&#39;m paired with two, lucky me&#34;, he patted his own shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Says the basic flirtatious Francis&#34;, I cut him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gina pinched my arm turning towards Francis, &#34;You don&#39;t look bad yourself. Like I have to make an account of the girls who drop their jaws after looking at you&#34;, she sugarcoated my sarcastic tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I will go to each of them and secretly tell in their ears that Francis is gay&#34;, I winked at Gina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You whore&#34;, Francis made a nasty comment and later laughed to cover up for the look his driver gave him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like my best friends are&#34;, we all collapsed laughing at our irrelevant statements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We finally arrived. We got out and walked side by side. This party was a bit different from the earlier ones we had in high school. I could smell alcohol and the smoke lingered in my nose which was exhaled from cigarettes. I could see people making out in every corner, pass by with boys literally pouring out their tongues in a girl&#39;s throat. This party was not supervised by any teacher, which was one good thing that clearly meant no limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my God, I could sense us being in college&#34;, Gina twirled out of excitement after looking at the atmosphere around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes this party is so exotic&#34;, Francis made an instinct reply throwing his gaze at every girl who moved alone and was not accompanied by a partner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sadness concealed my face as I made another statement, &#34;I wish I could wait a little longer. I almost waited for this day for 4 years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let&#39;s make the most of it&#34;, Francis put his arm around me as his hands rested on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking towards the dance floor I realized that not many were really dancing, all they did was jumped either on the floor or on their partners, some even puked because of overuse of alcohol. Ew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey babe, wanna dance?&#34; A guy came towards Gina smirking and dang it, he was Samuel Smith, he had good looks paired with hazel eyes. He always used to try over Gina by complimenting her on small things like sometimes for good grades, sometimes for the dress she wore, and so on... We never noticed him much except his teeth. They were kind of yellow which could definitely make his look go from 100 to 20.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go for it&#34;, I and Francis signaled her. We both then moved our hands through our lips which meant that don&#39;t kiss that lips because of the teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gina hopped into the dance floor with the Samuel Guy. She seemed quite comfortable and easy with him. I and Francis started having a look at the party and commenting on everyone&#39;s dresses, walking style, partners, etc. We made sure that it was audible to only us because we did not mean to hurt any one&#39;s feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at that girl, she&#39;s continuously staring at you from top to bottom&#34;, I pointed towards the girl who was dressed in a black off-shouldered dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean Marie?&#34; Francis questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Go ask her for a dance and make the most out of it. She&#39;s so hot&#34;, I pushed Francis away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-but I cannot leave you alone Ammie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What am I? Three years old?&#34; I asked rhetorically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled and then went towards the Marie girl. I took a distanced view of the situation. They both went towards the open air space where the fire was lit from the woods. It looked more like a campfire which meant she definitely approved his proposal for the night. I was now alone. I looked at the watch, it was yet 8. I still had 15 minutes to pass time around this place so I wandered alone around trying to get the feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went near the dancing crowd and started dancing with the anonymous public out there. I really was enjoying my time as I never felt so alive before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alone?&#34; A guy randomly interrogated with a high pitch voice because the music was quite loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I mean yes, my best friends got their dates so probably yes&#34;, I shouted back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could not see his face clearly because of the innumerable amount of changing lights. But he had black eyes and was a bit shady in terms of skin. Three girls were hanging over him which definitely revealed his inner fuck boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I parted away after looking at the crowd as it was almost 8:15 pm so I had to leave. Gina was busy dancing so I did not disturb her and Francis was out of sight which forced my mind to think dirty things about him but it was quite obvious too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While walking on the road, I wiped out some amount of red lipstick as I had to look decent. I took the nearest taxi and finally reached the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was decorated in a very elegant way. It looked so sophisticated and classy at the same time. Since I knew the party was in the enormous ballroom which was on the underground floor, I first decided to drop my bag at my cabin which was on the seventh floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went through Mr. Richie Rich&#39;s cabin. He was busy locking the door of his cabinet. I looked at him and before we could make any eye contact, I changed my eyesight&#39;s direction by turning away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t create a chaos today&#34;, He unexpectedly spoke. I saw him examining me, my body, and my dress carefully. I could examine his gaze moving from my head till my toe.</p>
