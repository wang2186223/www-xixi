                <p>Within moments, I was tied to a rolling chair in some garage kind of dark place which smelled pathetic. I could feel my phone vibrate in my lap pocket so I kept silent and waited for the right moment. My hands and legs were tied to the chair tightly. They freed my mouth from the handkerchief and stuffed some pale bread in it, without my consent, and left, locking me in the garage alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stretched my fingers trying to free my hands so I could at least make a phone call. With great efforts, I could remove the rope&#39;s grip over my left hand. I wasn&#39;t a left-hand person but I didn&#39;t waste time freeing my right hand so I opened my call logs. It was Mr. Reynolds&#39;s missed call on the notification screen, so I quickly connected the call without wasting any more time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sleeping beauty&#34;, he sarcastically replied. &#34;Hold on for a minute, James &#34;, he stopped his conversation with James on the other side &#34;So when will you be here?&#34; he questioned me. I was alarmed by the fact that James was next to him, so I instinctively canceled the phone and tried connecting to Gina and Francis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one was able to pick the phone up so I tried to text them. I could hear the footsteps coming towards me, and I knew what it meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly send lined up messages, whichever was appropriate, in our fag group as Mr. Reynolds could or couldn&#39;t receive the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;napped&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;Please help&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those were the only words that actually hit my mind that moment, so I quickly sent the messages in a row. Till the moment, the hooligans already entered the cell. They took my phone and hit it hard on the ground, which consequently broke into pieces. I was not sure that my message was actually delivered because I didn&#39;t receive a delivery notification. An ocean of negative thoughts started drifting through my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>

                <p>&#34;Hi! can anyone h-e-a-r me&#34;, I emphasized the adjective in my sentence loudly but to my melancholy, it was just the non-living things which existed in the room, to whom I was basically audible too. I felt disconsolate and shattered, and I knew that I was now into something which had no way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow I had a small spark of positivity that maybe the message was delivered to the right people at the right time, and maybe my best friend&#39;s could unleash the Sherlock within them and give some serious reaction to the situation because basically half the time they thought that I was playing loose pranks which were something I didn&#39;t want to be mistaken with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eat something&#34;, a man came towards me with a pack of chips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go away&#34;, I shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do as instructed, cunt&#34;, he opened the packet of chips and stuffed them in my mouth to which I was grateful because I haven&#39;t eaten to my appetite ever since I got here, but to my discontent, they were tasteless and spicy. &#34;If I order something, you have to agree to it otherwise I know how to fulfill my wishes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spat all the chips after eating a bit which he stuffed in my mouth, on his torso, as he was in a standing position. I regretted so much that I couldn&#39;t spit it on his face. &#34;And I know exactly how to disobey your orders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came extremely close to me, our nose almost touching. &#34;We&#39;ll see to it, baby whore&#34;, he smirked and left without uttering another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was awakened from my quick nap when I heard footsteps coming towards me. The voice increased every consequent second which gave me chills through my spine, because the fact that I was staying locked with unknown men, made me question my virginity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was quite dark so the vision was blurry enough for me to recognize their faces, but, I somehow managed to arise the karate kid within me to offend the person who was coming in my direction, because the least I wanted was to be molested and lose virginity to someone who was completely unknown to me, not that I&#39;ll sleep with any known person. I believed in losing virginity to someone special, who I could count on, for the rest of my life. My thoughts were a bit of old fashioned, in this century.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person was just one hand distance away from me. I tried to push him with my face, which kind of rested harsh on his stomach. I kept hitting him twice, thrice, and continuously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not utter a word&#34;, my lips were pursed with the strong man&#39;s hand. His touch and voice felt familiar to me. I quickly paved my eyeballs towards him, but to my bewilderment, it was Mr. Reynolds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears of joy flow through my eyes. I couldn&#39;t wipe them off because my hands were possessed by a rope. &#34;Free me?&#34; I cleared my throat, wiping off the tears from my cheek with the help of my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t command Miss Waters&#34;, he instinctively started to unfold the rope by loosening the clove hitch. He then loosened each loop through the other loop making the operation a major success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears started to roll through my eyes because of the excess pressure that the rope possessed over my skin, which led to bruises all over my arms. My hands and legs developed a blackish and bluish color over my skin, due to lack of oxygen in the area of the bruises. Mr. Reynolds had saved me a lot many times but this time, he felt like family. Like someone, I would have never imagined being saved by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without considering anything else, I rested my face on his chest and extended my hands to his neck so that I could have a tighter grip on myself. Though, as much I wanted a friendlier hug, but the situation was already full of complexion. It felt like I had no energy in my body, which kind of gave me a feeling that my legs were paralyzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that I was overthinking about it, but my legs were unable to behold my entire body. It felt like they were frozen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You okay?&#34; Mr. Reynolds quickly supported me through his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not fine, to be honest&#34;, I tried not to be sarcastic but what kind of a person asks such a question. It&#39;s like asking someone to go on a world tour, who is on a ventilator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly lifted me in his arms and rushed towards the door &#34;Stay firm, don&#39;t keep moving&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded to his instructions and tried turning myself into a mannequin which was very difficult for me because I was habitual to making movements in my body every second minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tie both of them and wait for Boss&#34;, an ugly, tall, dark, and bold muscular man instructed his fellow hooligans, and alarmed towards us instinctively, after pushing at the main door harshly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds placed me softly on the ground over the grass straws and turned around towards the men extending his arms signaling them to stay backward. &#34;How much money do you want to get over us?&#34; he removed his cheque-book, after questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loyalty matters and we have already given our word to our boss, that we will keep the girl with us until he signals to free her&#34;, he turned and looked towards me and continued &#34; We were not going to harm the girl anyways&#34;, he marched towards Mr. Reynolds and caught him from his collars, uplifting him a bit &#34;We can&#39;t do any harm to you as instructed by our Boss, because he certainly wants o harm you himself, so we have to wait till then&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish loyalty mattered to your Boss as much as it matters to you&#34;, he contradicted his statement pushing him backward and punching him on his chest, followed by his stomach .&#34;Dare touch me again&#34;, he warned them by pushing him so hard that he directly got laid on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tall dark man came towards me after giving Mr. Reynolds an enraging look. He later tied me to the pole by giving me a push from his legs, which was one hand distance away from me. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare&#34;, Mr. Reynolds warned those men again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she your love interest? Because I am basically going to be rewarded by an oscar tonight, as soon as Boss makes an entry here&#34;, he removed a small pocket knife from his key chain &#34;which is probably going to be her&#34;, he ripped off my right arm&#39;s sleeves which exposed the skin. I tried to cover my thighs whilst stretching the skirt from my teeth, as I was wearing a cotton knee-length dress, which I was probably wearing for a week. Ew.</p>
