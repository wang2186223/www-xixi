                <p>I scowled at him and left his cabin. I took longer steps than usual and halted straight in the emergency room. &#34; I&#39;ll take up from this &#34;, I signaled the nurse to leave the room and she did as per instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the closest seat from the bed and sat next to him looking at his pale face and body. I took his hand in mine carefully so that I couldn&#39;t misplace the syringe which was connected to his upper arm. &#34;Are you going to stay like this forever &#34;, my waterline was already moist by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never knew that this man would affect me to this extent. I&#39;ve always wanted to put a full stop on his cruel sarcastic mouth but when it was happening actually, I was losing my senses. All I wanted at this moment was to hear negative comments on every dialogue of mine, to hear sarcasm, and to be judged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;hey, wake up. You&#39;ve got more than 5 months to torture me. I am looking forward to tolerating them as I&#39;ve signed those contract papers and successfully completed a month from that day .&#34;, a tear traveled through my chin and took its place on the hand I was holding. I wiped it with my bare hands and kissed it softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed at him and the electrocardiogram turn by turn for a while expecting a movement, there was none. With every passing moment I lost my hope to have him back but I had faith in the almighty as he wouldn&#39;t let me regret this for the rest of my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want from me God ?&#39;, I looked up knowing my behavior was childish but I practiced it anyway. &#34;I&#39;m not going to answer him back rudely, arrogantly, harshly, and wickedly. Just make him fine and I&#39;ll never speak badly to him till he recovers &#34;, I thought for a while &#34;Okay for a whole month. I tried bribing God whilst making an agreement with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was drowsy as I myself didn&#39;t recover perfectly, my head hurt and every joint in my body felt weak but I&#39;d almost forgotten every pain of mine after looking at his condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I placed my head close to his hand without shifting my sitting position. My head started to feel heavy, maybe because of stress and crying so I kept my eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I felt a little movement in my hair. I raised my head once to check out on him. His fingers moved a bit, I quickly turned my direction towards the machine and to my surprise, there was an increase in its movement too. I pressed the warning bell innumerable times until the doctor and his staff arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woah ! not less than a miracle &#34;, the doctor remarked focusing his attention on the electrocardiogram. &#34;Wait for us outside Miss Reynolds, we&#39;ll inform you once we&#39;re done. &#34;, the doctor then gave clear instructions to his team about the surgery. I made my way towards the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you now have to believe that destiny has a plan which included you two together &#34;, the senior nurse once again came and sat next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t even know what do we have &#34;, I rested my chin on my fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I can make out things from your part at least &#34;, she looked in my eyes and smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s like one moment we&#39;re having a happy time and the other moment we&#39;re fighting. He puts me in trouble all the time and is the first one to help me escape the troubles of my life too. He shouts at me all the time but can&#39;t resist when I&#39;m being shouted by a hooligan. I don&#39;t understand him and I guess, I never will &#34;, yes I was blabbering out these things to a complete stranger, though she felt familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave it on time and fate and let things happen as they&#39;re destined to be &#34;, she suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for listening to me &#34;, I felt relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But certainly don&#39;t ever lose up an opportunity just because you think there is zero possibility for it to arise. Fight for the things and people you like regardless of their thoughts. I&#39;ve had real bad memories, I don&#39;t want you to experience the same &#34;, I heard every word which escaped her mouth carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I side hugged her for comforting me and advising me, it felt like I was acquainted with her and I had no idea how.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat there still looking at the red light over the door of the emergency room. It was almost 2 hours but there was no sign of the doctors. As soon as the light dimmed, the senior doctor marched out and came towards me. I stood up at once showing him respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s out of danger, will be conscious anytime now &#34;, I hopped out of excitement and hugged the doctor. My hugging reflexes are yet to be trained so as to stop pouncing on any unknown person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations Mrs. Reynolds, your prayers paid well. I suggest you yourself should take some rest now but first eat something &#34;, he smiled gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I will, thank you so much &#34;, I shook his hands and turned towards my ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sipped tea after eating biscuits. I didn&#39;t really feel like eating anything heavy no matter how much the doctor suggested me to. I took my medicines with water without making any excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he awake ?&#34;, I questioned the nurse to which she nodded which clearly meant a no &#34;Can you please have a look and notify me? &#34;, I asked for a favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, of course &#34;, she turned around and left the room. After a couple of moments, she was back &#34;the nurse there said to me that he gained consciousness some minutes ago, he&#39;s resting again now &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go look over &#34;, I skipped the sweet lime juice she bought for me and paved my way towards him. I peeped through the door, his eyes were closed so I took slow and soft footsteps than usual. I took my old place and sat there observing him for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up and went closer to him, there were pipes connected through his nose. I pushed away from the tiny hair from his forehead, his face was now clean and properly bandaged from all the wounds. I gave a small peck on his forehead continued by his nose and later on his lips. I just felt the desire to do this, I didn&#39;t intend to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I then heard footsteps so I regained my original position. The doctor showed up again as he examined the condition of Mr. Reynolds. He gave me a quick smile to which I smiled back. In a while, I saw Mr. Reynolds opening his eyes slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome back Aaron &#34;, the doctor greeted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh My God Finally! &#34;, I sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must say, you&#39;ve won the biggest battle of your life &#34;, the doctor encouraged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never lose &#34;, he stated, now I could feel him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got a wonderful woman, never let go off her. She&#39;s been here and prayed for you until you were out of danger &#34;, the doctor now was making my situation critical as I didn&#39;t really want him to know that I cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MM-hmm ?&#34;, he looked at the doctor with surprise in his eyes, he later focused his attention towards me and raised a brow. I didn&#39;t understand what it clearly meant but it really felt awkward now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll now give the husband and his wife some space &#34;, the doctor gave a sly smile and left making the situation more worse as I now definitely owed him an explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, Mr Reynolds, it&#39;s not how it seems. Only family members were allowed to know your well-being and condition. They assumed me your wife so I just added up to that assumption by keeping up with Mrs. Reynolds. Sorry &#34;, I said all the lines in one breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never asked you for an explanation. You&#39;ve played my wife earlier eh &#34;, he surprisingly didn&#39;t mind. I was astonished at his reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you take your medicines ?&#34;, I asked, cutting the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did . how about you ?&#34;, he questioned. A part of me was shocked because the bad-ass boss was inquiring upon my well being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did &#34;, I answered with a pleasant smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you should rest, you don&#39;t look well yourself &#34;, I nodded and left his room.</p>
