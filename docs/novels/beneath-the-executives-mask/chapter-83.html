                <p>I straightened myself on the bed , covered my body with the sheets and closed my eyes to relax. Days weren&#39;t as hard as I expected here .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up the moment my alarm started ringing, sunshine beamed through the window spreading light everywhere . No matter how much I wanted to stay in bed, I couldn&#39;t. After encountering a parcel on the table which was closer to my bed , I pulled it towards my direction and opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had a note over it, it read &#39;To Miss Waters&#39;, I knew who was it from.There was only one person in this world who was hesitant to call me by my first name. I don&#39;t know which century he belonged to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories relating to parcels drifted across my mind , how he sent me the waitress uniform when he wanted to annoy me, how he sent me a classy dress when he doubted my fashion sense . A part of me didn&#39;t want to open the parcel and the other part was curious too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly unwrapped the parcel after taking possession of the box . It wasn&#39;t heavy but it wasn&#39;t light either. It was neatly wrapped with a professional brown paper . To my astonishment, there was a white shirt with black trousers within it . It also had a letter &#39;thought you had nothing formal to wear&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile naturally took birth on my lips, I tightened my lips so as to prevent myself from blushing anymore. It had a &#39;A&#39; inscribed at the bottom of the letter , I couldn&#39;t really figure out what it denoted, Aaron or Amanda ? The main question was, since when did he start to think about someone who wasn&#39;t him .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rushing towards the bathroom, I quickly showered , fixed my hairs after drying my body . I covered my body with the formals , it fitted me perfectly . I analyzed my reflection in the mirror , gathered my hair in a ponytail, applied some lip gloss and left the room . I wasn&#39;t really prepared for the presentation but I knew Gina would brush me up at the end moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After strolling towards the exit of the big-long mansion, I eyed around to catch a glimpse of Mr Reynolds but to my content or maybe discontent, my eyes couldn&#39;t locate him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my joy, after a long long time I was going to college all by myself without any bodyguard . I breathed in cheerfully whilst exiting the door . There&#39;s a very famous proverb in English ,&#39;Speak of the devil and it arises&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, You &#34;, I fake smiled . He observed me from eye to toe, I matched my eye-balls with his as an attempt to inspect that whether something was wrong with my clothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good Morning &#34;, his hands were dug in either side of his narrow-fit pants which were paired with a black coat . His shirt&#39;s white fabric could be seen through, a tie added cherry to his formal look .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I doubt on that since you wished me&#34;, I took small steps completely avoiding him . I could hear the steps which followed me. On totally ignoring him , I removed my phone from my clutch to book an Uber . On succeeding on my booking, I tried getting in as the driver parked right next to his gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt obstructed, I couldn&#39;t move further as I felt a grip of someone&#39;s hands on my right wrist. I was pulled aback when my body got locked in his direction. &#34;Stop acting all violent for once&#34;, I stated annoyingly .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t need your ride , I&#39;m ready to pay though. Here&#39;s my card &#34;, he propelled his card towards the driver, he redirected the card to him whilst pushing it in his direction again . He entered his pin, removed the card and nodded looking at the driver whilst bidding him farewell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re coming with me &#34;, he commanded dragging me towards his car . He opened the door for me, I hopped in instinctively without debating further. I didn&#39;t want to spoil my mood and my day .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I draped the seat-belt across my body, I looked towards the window and avoided his existence completely . He didn&#39;t interrupt a word either . The remaining ride was silent and boring. All I could hear was the sound caused due to the brakes and horns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning my head a bit around for a while , I had the most embarrassing eye-contact with him. Was he shamelessly staring at me ? Well, for an instance, I was too. On reaching my college, he pulled the brake .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long will it take ?&#34;, he interrupted the silence .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know &#34;, I shrugged . Even if I did, I didn&#39;t intend to tell him because why would I want to give up on my freedom, even for a while. But to be honest, I didn&#39;t have an answer myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exited the car all by myself, he followed my actions after he carefully parked his Jaguar. I had no interests in cars, I just knew them by their brand names. &#34;Its my college &#34;, I pouted &#34;You can&#39;t just follow me everywhere &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirked looking at me &#34;I know , right ? What makes you think I am gonna enroll my name in the student&#39;s list ? As decided, I&#39;m going to accompany you in your way in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t agree, Oh wait , it isn&#39;t even a mutual decision .&#34;, I offended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I decided on both of our behalves . Come, show me your college now &#34;, he crooked his elbows, I totally neglected his actions and straightened my hands . I wasn&#39;t going to catch him whilst walking anyways.</p>
