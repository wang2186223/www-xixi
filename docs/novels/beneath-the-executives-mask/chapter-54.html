                <p>&#34;Why do you have to be so annoying?&#34;, I pouted and turned his head towards My boss&#39;s direction. Gina who was busy with Samuel concluded her romantic talks and shifted her attention to us. &#34;Show me how does he look now, last time he looked dope in the party &#34;, she sounded excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel clearly seemed jealous but being in a relationship doesn&#39;t really obstruct people from eyeing at hot people, I object if people believe in it.  Did I just call him hot? oh no, what&#39;s wrong with me. &#34;I don&#39;t find anything hot in him, Samuel take proper charge over your girl &#34;, I clearly lied and instigated Samuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gina pinched him on his arms and eyed at Mr. Reynolds, &#34;How did you not fall for him, even after a sexy make out ?&#34;, Gina questioned, I warned her to stop as Sonia was present at the moment too and I didn&#39;t want her to know things as she wasn&#39;t a really close friend to me plus what will she think about me now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She already had a shock plastered all over her face, I smiled shrugging. &#34;That was just a spur of the moment, nothing really intriguing &#34;, she didn&#39;t look much satisfied in fact I could sense the hunger in her eyes, hunger for gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell you everything but promise me it&#39;ll remain a secret &#34;, I warned as she sat clenching her fists and resting her chin on it showing her excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I take the pledge , I won&#39;t speak about it to anyone &#34;, so dramatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I kissed him like &#34;, I started to think to have a numerical count on my fingers.</p>

                <p>When I was gazing stars with him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we tried to fool the hooligans</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I gave him CPR</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he was in the ICU.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;4 times, I kissed him 4 times &#34;, my cheeks started to feel warm, I was aware that I was blushing no matter how much I tried to hide it. I didn&#39;t give Sonia details of each kiss, I just said her everything in numerical format.b 4 was a big number, I felt shy and awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grinned continuously, Francis was silently copying her expression but I didn&#39;t laugh at this scenario, I just avoided him. &#34;Was it just a kiss, I mean did things proceed ?&#34;, she wiggled her brows sounding curious as fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not more than that I guess &#34;, I lied but it was partly true too. &#34;I hate you, Gina, get some control over your mouth .&#34;, I slapped her playfully on her head spoiling her hairstyle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly settled it without complaining &#34;I love you too &#34;, she winked at me and then at Samuel confusing me that who were the three magical words for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s not talk about my rude, arrogant and stupid boss now&#34;, I tried changing the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please add &#39;hot&#39; in your innumerable adjectives for describing him &#34;, Gina was definitely distracted today, Sonia agreed with Gina. Oh my God were they a team now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess I should leave now &#34;, Samuel stood up and waved all of us goodbye, I was so happy about the fact that he&#39;s leaving. Everyone hugged him except for Sonia she shook hands with him considering the fact that she was new, I found her action relevant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t even pay his share before leaving &#34;, I frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll pay for him &#34;, Gina objected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up already, don&#39;t you understand the difference between taunt and joke ?&#34;, I didn&#39;t actually lie but covered my last sentence by labeling it as one. I took the last sip of wine and side hugged Gina &#34;I am sorry, I should be more friendly with him. Next time, I promise &#34;, I felt bitchy so I apologized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Ladies and Gentlemen &#34;, a man in his mid 30&#39;s suited in black stood in the middle, a beam of light circled him so that everyone focused towards him. &#34; I&#39;d like to invite you&#39;ll towards the dance floor, let&#39;s add sparks to this evening. I want every one of you to come dance with me &#34;, he instructed the musician to play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Francis stood at once, pulling me along with him &#34;Go away Dumb ass &#34;, I pushed him and took the seat at once. Sonia accompanied Francis, they seem to match each other&#39;s vibe. Not as life partners but maybe as weirdos, their behavior towards each other was very friendly, I really thought they were going to have lovey Dubey chemistry but I was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dance brought memories, every time I thought about dance it was him who was the first person that popped in my mind. Damn, I was getting obsessed. &#34;Let me pay first, we&#39;ll divide our shares later &#34;, I paid the bill through my credit card. I was glad that it wasn&#39;t much as per my expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I and Gina looked at Francis and Sonia &#34;I guess you should join them &#34;, I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way, he&#39;s literally dancing. No, he&#39;s not dancing, he&#39;s doing everything which is not connected to dancing. Look at your Sonia, she compliments her &#34;, She laughed continuously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seems like the man and the lady are the only ones in a crazy mood, Come on everyone. Join them &#34; Francis went closer to the host and murmured something in his ears, suddenly the Beam light was focused towards our direction</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way, Gina I am not leaving him once we get out &#34;, I facepalmed. Gina&#39;s look was full of amusement. I turned around to look at Mr. Reynolds praying hard that he didn&#39;t notice me here but I was wrong, he looked towards us. Everyone did. I hate Francis, I&#39;ll go tell every girl in his account that he is gay as revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gina didn&#39;t want to create a scene so she joined them on the dance floor, many people followed her. It was basically me who kept seated, an old lady who was in her wheelchair and Mr. Reynolds with one of his mate, his companions joined the dance too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The music got louder, I murmured to myself the lyrics in sync as an attempt to forget his presence. I cornered my eyes, without turning my head to have a look at him. The only person who accompanied him also joined everyone on the dance floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught me looking at him, why was he so smart. Oh no, what do I do now what if he considered me a stalker? I pushed my gaze towards my crazy bunch of people, I clapped at their weird dance. I removed my phone and took a quick video of them, just in case to blackmail them if they uploaded any ugly picture of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t gather enough guts to check him out again, no matter how much I wanted to. He was smart enough to trap me plus I didn&#39;t want to create an expression of &#39;fangirl&#39; in his eyes. He&#39;ll have another reason to be arrogant about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, Miss Waters --- &#34;, I heard a sexy whisper in my ears. I turned around and interlocked my eyes with a pair of dark blue eyes.</p>
