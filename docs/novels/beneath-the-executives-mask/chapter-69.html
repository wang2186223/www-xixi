                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Latching the main door of the room, I zipped the sides of the gown as per my fitting . I let the tassels flow through my sleeveless skin . I am glad I kept this extra clothing in my bag . I wasn&#39;t prepared for the masquerade ball at first place , if I had any idea about it then I would&#39;ve definitely carried a proper exotic outfit . Though , this one wasn&#39;t bad .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a floor length flowy dress which showed off my curves till the waist . I surrounded my neck with a simple chain so as to give it a decent effect .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chose small heels over the outfit as the gown was a bit too long for me to handle. I puffed the compact powder all over my face so as to maintain a balance over the uneven pores .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twisting my hairs into a bun I let off the small strands out giving it a messy look . Mess was hot , right ? . I gave a smokey effect to my eyes and applied a nude shade on my lips .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually I didn&#39;t like to get ready but today I wanted to look different . Good kind of different , in his language . I tried blushing red to my cheeks as the thought of him had done half of it&#39;s work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want t-to confess something &#34;, I stammered &#34;I like you , I mean I love you . I can&#39;t deny the fact that I have started feeling for you . I don&#39;t expect the same from you, I lo-love you and I really do &#34;, I pouted whilst practicing with my reflection in the mirror .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tapped on my head as I was reciting the lines but never once I found it overwhelming and perfect . Shut up Amanda , just go with the flow .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at my reflection one last time I exited the room . I took deep breadths as I marched towards the hall room . The place was royally decorated with white curtains all around . The carpet was red . There were small tables around which had an orchid bouquet over each . The ceilings were vaulted with light blue lights . The decoration was very impressive .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I twirled my eye balls around to find Mr Reynolds as he wasn&#39;t visible . &#34;Who are you searching for , Miss Waters ?&#34;, I felt a touch on my earlobe when I heard a murmur .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You &#34;, Mr Reynolds wore a black fit tuxedo over a white shirt. His perfectly toned torso showed his perfect body . My eyes widened in awe and amazement . I shamelessly gazed at his perfect face for a while , the moment my reflexes passed a message to my eyes , I turned away as it felt quite inappropriate to stare at someone without sunglasses .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;yes , me &#34; , he stepped closer as he examined me from head to toe. I pursed my lips tight to avoid the smile which was taking birth. Come on Mr Reynolds I have wasted whole 30 minutes of my life to get dolled up , compliment me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look amazing &#34;, I regretted the words which escaped my lips . I tried to look away but his eyes were interlocked with mine .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always do &#34;, he smirked . The waiters moved around the hall-room with trays which were filled with different kind of masks .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me &#34;, I called him and covered my face with a red mask . Red went well with the color of my dress . I knotted the ribbon of the mask through my hands . Everyone had their faces covered so it was quite difficult for me to locate the few people I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you going to wear one ?&#34;, I questioned as he didn&#39;t collect his mask from the tray .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not a firm believer of such balls . I don&#39;t think I should attach a mask to my face &#34;, he contradicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I insist please &#34;, I picked up one silver mask for him .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay , not because you insisted &#34;, he took the mask and wore it over his face . The mask covered three fourth of his face , his pale pink lips and sculpted jaw were yet visible . I smiled as he did something I asked him to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love birds &#34;, we heard a familiar voice . Without even guessing I could say that it was Cody . David was latched with him . I hugged them both warmly , Mr Reynolds greeted them with a nod , I always wondered why he distanced himself so much from every one .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed his hand on my waist and squeezed me closer to him, I gasped in astonishment, &#34;Make yourself comfortable Miss Waters , I&#39;ll see you around &#34;, he looked at me one last time and disappeared in the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am glad I finally have some people to talk with, Mr Reynolds is so silent all the time &#34;, I sighed looking at Cody and David &#34;So tell me how did you confess your love to each other ?&#34;, I wasn&#39;t just intrigued but was trying to secretly take tips .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They smiled looking at each other , David was the first to speak up &#34;Though , it&#39;s been only a day of us as official but I feel he&#39;s my soul mate already &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We didn&#39;t really have to confess our love to each other . We had those sexy eye contacts , unbreakable ones . Eyes speak , they do --&#34;, Cody cut his sentence .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course they do &#34;, he caressed David&#39;s hand. &#34; I just couldn&#39;t resist my desire to kiss him and to my delight , he kissed me back . We had our thing ever since &#34;, they looked at each other and kind of got lost .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh , he kissed me and I kissed him back. Not once , not twice but a lot more than that . We should be having a thing then . No , their love story definitely didn&#39;t prove out to be one sort of help in my situation . I didn&#39;t really intend to interrupt their cute moments so I distanced myself away from them .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled cheerfully when we had an eye contact . This party was monotonous for me , It would&#39;ve been relishing if I had Gina , Francis and Sonia along . I went towards the buffet , filled my plate with delicious delicacies and took a seat at the nearest table .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Food kept me sane , Mr Reynolds was no where to be seen . The lights were dim by this moment as more then half of the people gathered around the dance floor. Food kept me satiated .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On sensing a gentle touch on the wounded area over my shoulder , I gasped and turned behind to have a look at that person . It didn&#39;t take me much long to personify the human figure . Knowing the fact that he was Mr Reynolds , I refocused my attention in the direction of my plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did he touch me on my wounded area and caused me affliction ? . He has tortured me , insulted me , passed sarcastic comments but never once caused me harm . In fact he was my knight in shining armor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What ?&#34;, I questioned , noodles swooped down from my folk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer me , was he numb ? He instead propelled his hand in my direction . Was he escorting me till the floor ? Oh no no . I chewed the food and gulped them with coke . My hand&#39;s weren&#39;t dirty but I yet wiped it with the tissue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laced my hands with his and accompanied him to the floor . The touch didn&#39;t electrify my nerves , it didn&#39;t question my sanity . I peeped as I turned my face towards his direction to cross-check . He had the same suite , same mask and the same ruthless attitude . He was definitely my Mr Reynolds .</p>
