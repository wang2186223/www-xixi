                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sang the birthday song once again. I slashed the chocolate cake carefully without spoiling my fingers much. I gave the biggest piece to Francis, he always demanded one. I, then distributed the rest of the pieces to everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Gina was formal enough to feed me with a piece too. Sonia took her piece and smashed it on my face, I did the same. Everyone joined in. We laughed hysterically whilst looking at each other&#39;s faces. This moment could stop forever and I wouldn&#39;t complain at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I definitely should take a shower&#34;, I climbed out of the bed, collected my floral knee length shift dress and rushed towards the bathroom. I was the birthday girl. I should at least look presentable as I knew I was going to be on everyone&#39;s social media account&#39;s stories. On exiting the bathroom, I saw huge heap of pizzas and coke placed on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m the birthday girl, treats should be on me&#34;, I pouted as it didn&#39;t feel right. I should be the one paying for their food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did all the formalities come from?&#34;, Gina watched me with cornered eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Through Mr Aaron, oops Mr Reynolds&#34;, Francis laughed whilst mimicking me. He did actually spoke in a female&#39;s accent and voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slapped him playfully, took possession of my slice of pizza and gulped the whole bottle of coke. &#34;So, how are you Amanda &#34;, Dan interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better now &#34;. I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly and steadily, the door flew open. We watched the shadow appear silently, without a doubt anyone could guess that it was Mr. Reynolds. He arched his brows, examined us for a while and then broke the silence ,&#34;So, a birthday party is going on, who is the one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pinched Gina, and warned Francis and Sonia by widening my eyes, Dan didn&#39;t look towards me, he also was quite distant in terms of spaces. &#34;It&#39;s Da---&#34;, Dan cut my sentence the moment I was going to fake his birthday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amanda&#39;s birthday, don&#39;t you have a clue about it, buddy &#34;, Dan pointed towards me. I pouted looking at him and then replaced my expression with a fake smile. I didn&#39;t want him to know that it was my birthday. He already did his part of spoiling it anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh &#34;, he sighed, looked at me one last time. &#34;Have fun everyone&#34;, closed the door silently and exited the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, made sure that he exited the room first and focused my attention towards everyone. &#34;He didn&#39;t even care to wish&#34;, Gina&#39;s face was plastered with annoyance. She knew what I felt for him, though it was in past tense. Maybe, a part of me denied but even presently the feelings weren&#39;t completely vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dan Attrey , If you weren&#39;t Sonia&#39;s boyfriend then maybe I would&#39;ve punch your nose by now&#34;, I looked at Dan angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged and replied, &#34;Did I do something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She didn&#39;t want him to know about her birthday &#34;, Gina explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t wish either, doesn&#39;t makes a difference&#34;, Dan sorted his point of view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the hour, I had small fights with Dan. Don&#39;t blame me, I was annoyed. We ate pizzas and fought for the last piece and Francis shared his hilarious experiences which I missed. After every 10 minutes, Sonia and Dan would begin with their little make-out session and to be honest they looked cute, really cute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I knew, why he was in my birthday party. Not that I dislike him, he&#39;s a nice man and most importantly took care of Sonia and loved her tenderly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time for gifts&#34;, Gina propelled a huge box in my direction. I, carefully opened it, I side-hugged Gina thanking her for such a beautiful gift. The box included makeup from all the top brands including Mac, Kyliecosmetics, HudaBeauty, Nars etc. I could even open a small retail shop with the help of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My turn&#34;, Francis placed a small box on my palms which was neatly packed and decorated with a ribbon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A titan&#34;, I wasn&#39;t much surprised, it was a beautiful watch which had diamonds studded on its belt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that you&#39;re on time&#34;, he winked and I punched his stomach playfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you like it, It&#39;s from Dan and me&#34;, Sonia passed a Vero Moda bag in my way. I grabbed it from her and opened it. It was a beautiful off-shouldered black shift dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love it, thank you&#34;, I thanked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gina looked at the watch , &#34;2 am. Maybe we should leave. I hope you have a great day Amanda. We love you&#34;, Gina hugged me and later everyone joined in. I wanted them to stay but I couldn&#39;t force them to. I was well aware of the fact that Gina had strict parents and a group meet was pointless without the presence of even one member.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched them leave the room. I took a closer view of the gifts once again. It&#39;s so strange that some people who we name as friends can make us forget about every ongoing drama in our lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rested my back on the bed, closed my eyes but I couldn&#39;t sleep so I decided to try out the stuff they gifted me. I unzipped my dress quickly and then covered my body with the off-shouldered black dress Sonia gifted me. It wasn&#39;t much long. It was 4 inches above my knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I twisted Francis&#39;s watch around my wrists and pinched my cheeks with pink blusher. I decided to go for a bold shade, so I coloured my lips red. I messed my hairs a bit, I opened my front camera to upload a birthday selfie because I knew that I was not getting any chance to leave this mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That person came in , inquired, arched a brow and left. He didn&#39;t even care to wish me. Heartless would be an understatement for him. A part of me expected his wish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I come in?&#34;</p>
