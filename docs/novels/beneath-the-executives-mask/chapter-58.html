                <p>My frown deepened at her expressions, why do friends have to be so unbearable? &#34;just like you suggested Sonia, I should get over him and get under someone else. I should give Dan a try, what do you think ?&#34;, it was my time now. I smirked doing a quick hair flip .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t do that &#34;, she pinched her nose making a puppy face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t of course &#34;, I laughed at her face, her possessive nature. She laughed along too, it was not much time when I met her but she already matched my vibe. I liked talking to her and pouring my heart out to her, Gina got busy with Samuel but God gifted me a new bitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my open hair into a bun and connected a bobby bin to it so as to set it tight &#34;I&#39;ve to leave for Werttop with him tomorrow, I don&#39;t want to lose control over my feelings and make a joke of myself as he certainly doesn&#39;t feel the same about me &#34;, I sighed distressing the atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;hey-hey , you&#39;ll do fine. I believe in you . You&#39;re strong just don&#39;t allow him to make you weak &#34;, she stood up as she came towards me &#34;As I said, I do believe in you &#34;, she placed her hand on my shoulder. &#34;Keep me updated, I need every minute details &#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Focus Amanda Focus , I turned my laptop on as I re-read every mail after Sonia left, she was such a sweetheart. I needed a friend in office and I got one to which I am extremely grateful. I suddenly realized that I had to shop for the trip as I lacked fancy clothes, without wasting a second I locked my cabin&#39;s door and walked out of the office as I already completed the work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked straight into the mall alone, I read the tag 50% off on one brand. I quickly walked in as it grabbed my attention. Which kind of girl won&#39;t like this tag? I pulled out some fancy clothes and haphazardly placed them on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sided my eyes as I realized the burden I was carrying along so I marched towards the changing room and tried each one of them quickly. There were like 4 clothes which included a shrug, a black knee-length dress, and two jackets. I had some clothes in my closet at my house which I could carry along too so I decided to buy these four only for the five-day trip which included the slaughter of my weekend plans with my girl gang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes took a halt at the black lingerie, it was lacy with deep embroidery . It looked so beautiful so I decided to buy it at once . But why do I need to buy lingerie, I kept moving as I wasn&#39;t really in need of it and I didn&#39;t really show my body to anyone so it didn&#39;t matter as I was so single. If Gina would&#39;ve been here she&#39;d definitely purchase it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can buy for yourself, you don&#39;t need to shop for the world but yourself &#34;, my heart was commanding me to buy and even I had the urge to so I decided to buy it at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up my loaded suitcase, I went towards my mom to bid her goodbye &#34;Take care Mom, I hope Sam&#39;s home by afternoon. Don&#39;t worry much about me. Love you&#34;, Mom kissed me on my forehead and gave me clear instructions regarding the trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t go roaming alone at the vacant place&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay in a group with your office colleagues&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have your meals on time, don&#39;t skip any&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed at mom&#39;s concern towards me and got inside the taxi which I booked earlier. Reaching upon my office, I guided the taxi driver to pick aside. I paid him the exact change and exited the taxi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds could be seen from far away, his face looked a shade lighter because of the sunlight. His black sunglasses complimented his black blazer, he wore white v necked t-shirt inside his blazer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waved at him grinning when his eyes met mine, he didn&#39;t react. I pushed my bag towards his car, I&#39;m glad it had wheels beneath so I didn&#39;t have to carry the weight because certainly, my stuff weighed more than me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there no one who&#39;ll come along? &#34;, I inquired questioning as I stood facing him, our eyes met, I had to push my head up while we talked as he was taller than me. Not that my height was small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, do you see anyone else ? &#34;, I twirled my eyes around to check upon. There was no one, not even his driver. Is he going to drive? oh no it felt like a long journey already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly took the back seat of the car after settling my luggage in the trunk. He took the driver&#39;s seat in a while as he shifted his sunglasses on the top of his head but he didn&#39;t drive, he just settled himself comfortably after attaching the seat belt over his torso. He sat still as he waited for someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you waiting for someone? &#34;, I questioned. He gave a quick nod which certainly meant a no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why aren&#39;t you driving? &#34;, I questioned again perplexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you certainly consider yourself my boss or do you take me as your driver ? &#34;, he frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, wait. Where did that come from ? &#34;, his frown deepened, I didn&#39;t really realize that I was seated on the back seat but that certainly doesn&#39;t make him look like a driver or maybe it does, he did really believe in that stereotypical condition where bosses sit on the back seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh, whatever&#34;, I banged and opened the door of the passenger seat. I surrounded my eyes with sunglasses because it was quite sunny plus now I could easily have a quick nap while he drove because I didn&#39;t expect him to chit-chat with me during the drive</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What now ? &#34;, he was staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seat belt&#34;, he raised his brows, I connected the seat belt around myself. Within moments he started the ride as he completely ignored my presence. I looked at him in between but he kept his focus on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I removed my phone from my clutch and connected the aux wire to it as I didn&#39;t want the awkward silence to take over the car. I leaned in to change the song as the wire was a bit small so I placed my phone at the small hollow place there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the music concealed my ears, I laughed and clapped when the singer sang my favorite lines. I didn&#39;t dare to look at Mr. Reynolds as his scary glares would spoil my trip mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Push and pull like a magnet do &#34;, I shouted as I swayed my hands in the air. Loud music did something to me, it ceased my power to think. I would&#39;ve jumped like an idiot if I wasn&#39;t seated in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am in love with your booooooooody &#34;, I increased the volume.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Waters &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh - I oh-I Oh I Oh -I &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Waters &#34;, he squealed. I stopped my actions at once as I looked over at his face, anger plastered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was bewildered at his sudden change in mood. He turned the music off as he disconnected the aux wire from my phone. &#34;You can&#39;t just do that, I can&#39;t sit here for 7 hours straight without any entertainment &#34;, I offended.</p>
