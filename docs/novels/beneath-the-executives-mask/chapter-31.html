                <p>&#34;W-WHAT? I didn&#39;t invite you here. You see I don&#39;t even have my phone. They broke it. It took a 3-month internship for me to purchase that phone&#34;, I tried keeping my point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously Waters. All you care about is your phone. How very impressive?&#34; he fake smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to be here. I did all this for my family. For...&#34;, I paused for a while &#34;For you, Mr. Reynolds&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds looked at me for a while with a straight face and then replied &#34;I got a call from a guy, who addressed him as your best friend&#34;, I nodded waiting for him to continue &#34;We decided upon a place to meet and talk. We were joined by a girl too, at the gathering. She had evidence&#34;, he looked towards the ground &#34;evidence about someone who I claimed as my brother, and who was the sole person I trusted upon&#34; I could feel his voice turning low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Mr. Reynolds, it&#39;s okay!&#34;, I tried consoling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And no one gives you permission, to risk your life here, for me Miss. Waters&#34;, anger could be felt from his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I - I&#34;, my mouth just felt short for words, so I paused for like minutes and continued &#34;My sister was included into all of this&#34; I narrated him the whole story of perverted James, explaining to him briefly about every incident that happened before being kidnapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you didn&#39;t even consider talking to me about it&#34;, he yet sounded angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I tried&#34;, I cut his sentence &#34;I tried, but then got into this &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should&#39;ve texted me&#34;, he opposed my sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thought a meeting would be appropriate&#34;, I kept my point &#34;So how does James know about you knowing everything&#34;, I questioned interrupting the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your phone call gave him a clue, God Damn it. He was suspicious since then. I somehow tried to fool him by calling it a business meeting of me getting away, from town, but then I was caught up by the guards&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you inform the police about it?&#34; I interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was going to, but then, I didn&#39;t want to alarm James about it. I just hope that your friends call the cops&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I ask you one last question?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t stop anyway. Carry on&#34;, he nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know that I was here and why didn&#39;t my friends come to save me instead?&#34; I raised my eyebrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suppose you wanted one answer&#34;, he raised his right eyebrow and continued &#34;Because I am Aaron Reynold&#39;s. I have one whole technical team&#34;, he started to flaunt his rich identity &#34;I warned your friends to stay away from this situation. They looked quite innocent too&#34; he looked towards me &#34;In fact, they were so innocent that they even tried to contact your mom and tell her about it&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did they?&#34; I questioned expecting a positive answer which favored my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I stopped them and assured them that I&#39;ll get you home safe. There&#39;s one whole contract whose conditions you have to satisfy, and I couldn&#39;t let you run away from it yet &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t some joke Mr. Reynolds&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly&#34;, he frowned &#34;this could&#39;ve been easier if you would have shared things with me earlier&#34;, he contradicted my statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought I could manage to save my family and&#34;, I inhaled deeply &#34;and you, of course, you have helped me all the time. I&#39;m always in trouble. My clumsiness has always created problems for me&#34;, a tear rolled through my eyes. I turned around because I didn&#39;t want to act weak in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So now if you have all your answers, Miss. Waters can we try to find a way out?&#34; he tried to make the situation lighter and tried moving but the rope was tightly gripped to his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe I can try harder&#34;, I tried moving a bit, since I could do a bit of movement. I took charge of my neck chain from my mouth and caught it tightly between my lips and rubbed it over the cord to and fro for a couple of minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You even think, this is going to help. Your chain isn&#39;t sharp enough&#34;, he sounded so disinterested in my plan but I kept trying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After like 10 minutes there was a cut on the rope &#34;keep doing&#34;, he cheered out of excitement. I so wanted to do a quick hair flip but I tried to be focused on my goals. After applying continuous pressure, the rope got chopped. I freed my legs by unfolding the rope and crawled towards Mr, Reynolds as I was yet unable to stand accurately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Impressive&#34;, he helped me untangling himself from the rope force. We were both free now. Mr. Reynolds started to look around so that we could possibly find some way to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh look there&#39;s a small window there, behind the exhaust fan&#34;, he pointed towards the fan which was covered with dust and was almost invisible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took Mr. Reynolds&#39;s hand and caught him tight so that he couldn&#39;t move any further. &#34;Please listen to me for once&#34;, I instinctively replied so that he couldn&#39;t think any negative about me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MM HMM &#34;, he nodded which clearly meant that I should speak without wasting any more time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do me a favor. Please-Please let go of me, don&#39;t take me along. I can&#39;t really walk or run nicely. It can create a problem for both of us, so please GO Aaron. Please&#34;, I exaggerated the word &#39;please&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds looked into my eyes for a moment and then started to march towards the window. He quickly unscrewed everything and pushed the fan out with the help of a stick. He hopped up to see if there was anyone closer to that space and whether it was safe for him to sneak out. He then turned around and came running towards me and uplifted me through my thighs resting my stomach on his right shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;stop right now&#34;, I tried not to shout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make me&#34;, he pushed me up with all his strength &#34;Try not to make any noise. Just jump&#34;, I did what I was instructed about. My legs did hurt me after the jump but that pain was nothing more than the thought of being sexually harassed by unknown men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds jumped at the moment after me. &#34;I&#39;ll try walking&#34;, I took shelter from the wall and tried standing up. It did hurt but I had to show courage. I couldn&#39;t just be troublesome to Mr. Reynolds for being a complete gentleman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With this speed Miss. Waters, either one of us is going to die. I am the one they&#39;ll hunt for sure&#34;, he came closer and picked me up with both of his hands. &#34;Careful&#34;, he signaled me as my balance shook for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t thank you enough&#34;, I looked at him but didn&#39;t get the courage to thank him loud because I knew he&#39;d give a sarcastic reply no matter how much he&#39;d be meaning the same thing.</p>
