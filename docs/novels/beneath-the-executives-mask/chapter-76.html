                <p>&#34;You&#39;re forcing me to . I don&#39;t want to really do this but I can&#39;t help it . I know if I don&#39;t do this , you&#39;ll run away . I&#39;m just doing this for your benefit , for your safety . You&#39;re well aware of the fact that James is dangerous . and-- &#34;, he paused .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And?&#34;, I arched my brows at him in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And , I don&#39;t want to lose you &#34;, he laced his fingers with mine . I gazed at our intertwined hands thinking how everything could be perfect if he didn&#39;t engage himself in those shitty activities. I knocked myself out of my thoughts and tried loosening up my fingers .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled away that very instant and rested his hands on the steering wheel again .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Failing miserably at an attempt to open the door knob got me exhausted. He swayed the remote in the air showcasing it to me and then simply slipped it inside his pocket . A smirk took birth on his lips . I couldn&#39;t resist on my desire to punch him so I leaned closer towards him and with great force rested my fist on his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try harder&#34;, he inserted the key in the hole and turned it around . I could hear the engine , slowly , he accelerated the speed to the fullest . I turned away facing the window , it was dark as it was midnight . Focusing my attention on the moon , I tried diverting my mind .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A part of me cried , the other part was solacing me to act stronger . I deeply inhaled the cold air from the A/c . I looked at my naked hands , they were turning a shade of red due to the cold temperature and also because of overthinking. I shut away the conditioner ahead of me and fixed my attention towards the window again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The radio played all types of slow romantic songs . I turned channels in the sense to get a rhythm of the rock music and then finally turned it off because the playlist was overrated . Love was overrated . I now knew why Francis never got into it , why he always did casual relationships.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr Reynolds tried initiating a conversation a lot many times. I ignored every question of his and didn&#39;t even face him directly .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look , I know what I did was wrong but stop over reacting &#34;, he pulled over the brake and unbolted the seat belt around his body whilst looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Over reacting ?&#34;, I repeated .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can say &#39;sorry&#39; once again if that heals . Amanda , please. At least , talk to me &#34;, he acted like he was affected by my ignorance .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I faced him , looked into his dark blue eyes and continued &#34;It&#39;s Miss Waters for you &#34;, I didn&#39;t intend to cry but I couldn&#39;t stop . I couldn&#39;t digest the fact that he betrayed me for this long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine , Miss Waters . We&#39;ll talk about this the next morning &#34;, he pushed his hair back forming a spike out of it . No, I didn&#39;t fantasize his little actions anymore . They say that whenever a person does any bad to you , they degrade their values from your heart . This was happening with me right now .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just keep driving &#34;, I rested my head on the seat and closed my eyes as an attempt to sleep . Throwing out the garbage of my thoughts I kept my eyes shut . Hearing another brake , I woke up instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He unwrapped the seat belt from his body and leaned closer to me , our nose touched when he attempted to remove the belt . He on purpose slowly leaned more , his jaw touched my chin . I pouted hesitantly but couldn&#39;t push him away because my hands were locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re home &#34;, he exited the car from his side and opened the door for me. Don&#39;t be a gentleman please.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you&#39;re home. I am not &#34;, I angrily replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Its we for a while now. &#34;, he helped me exit the car . I tilted my chin up to have a look at the grand mansion . Though it was night but his mansion was light enough to illuminate the atmosphere . It looked immensely huge from the outside .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least , take em off &#34;, I raised my hands in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not before you get in &#34;, he crooked his hands around my waist and helped me walk inside the house. The watchman greeted him to which he just nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked through the long driveway with long palm trees alongside ,a huge fountain was situated at a distance from the huge main door made of beautifully carved wood. A long pool near the walkway headed the entrance . His hands were curled around my waists which sent shivers through my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two of his workers opened the huge door after spotting him , I could see them watching me through cornered eyes as our proximity towards each other could make anyone wonder about our relation . It was more of a palace then a mansion .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I twirled my eye balls around to have a look at his place . Beautiful would be an understatement , it was exquisite . I tried having control over my heartbeats as his touch did irresistible impulse of me to go lunatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many white pillars surrounded the entrances , each situated at a huge distance from the other. The flooring was of marble , its white color was clean enough for me to have a reflection of myself . He guided me towards the huge spiral staircase , the walls had carved statues of every beautiful place of this world , namely the seven wonders .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laced my fingers with his whilst directing me to follow his lead . I tried pulling my hands away but couldn&#39;t as my movements were obstructed by the handcuffs .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was so perfect and alluring that I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off from this place . I got lost every time I observed every thing in detail . Who was he ? A king . His place was even prettier then any museum I ever visited .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Waters ?&#34;, he alarmed me bringing back to reality whilst shaking me from my shoulder gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah ?&#34;, I questioned back after being alarmed by his instant reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me unlock your hands &#34;, pulling my hands closer to his body he attached the key and unlocked my hands and freed me .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Mr Aaron Reynolds &#34;, I stretched every letter of his name word by word, I pushed him towards the floor after reaching the last stair . Yeah , I didn&#39;t like him much at the moment but I obviously couldn&#39;t do anything which could cause him any type of harm .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not again , Miss Waters &#34;, he stiffened himself after standing up . I descended the stairs with full speed and ran towards the main door . &#34;Stop right there , don&#39;t act smart &#34;, he rushed towards me in an electrifying speed. I gasped when two muscular men closed the door instinctively after spotting me .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thumped my feet and took steps backwards in trepidation when they forwardly marched towards me .My back suddenly collided to some body , I turned my head around to have a look at that person .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our heights didn&#39;t match , my forehead touched his chin .My whole world came to a standstill when my eyes interlocked with his .I gasped and took a slow step back realizing that I couldn&#39;t run away from his place .His expressions clearly showed that he was secretly laughing on me .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t just trap me here &#34;, I pointed on his chest and complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Precautions are better then cure , look at these people around &#34;, he turned me in all directions by taking support of my shoulders , &#34;Every one is going to keep their eyes on you and also mark every action what you do &#34;, he smirked picking me up again, bridal style .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His right hand rested on my ass and his left hand were crooked around my neck . He looked straight whilst he walked , my attention rested on his perfect sculpted face. He didn&#39;t stroll towards the stairs but towards the elevator. Oh , this place had an elevator too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This place was more or less like a mall , the deeper you go the more you explore. &#34;Maybe you should consult a nutritionist &#34;, he smirked giving birth to a hole on his left cheek . Dimples were my weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you just call me fat ?&#34;, I pouted in annoyance &#34;Place me down , I can walk Aaron &#34;, I outstretched his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh &#39;Aaron&#39; , I didn&#39;t see that coming . This surprised me more then your any clumsy acts ever did &#34;</p>
