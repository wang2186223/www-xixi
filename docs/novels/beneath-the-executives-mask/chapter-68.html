                <p>I pointed towards the vacant chairs which were close to our bench &#34;have a seat &#34;, I smiled at them . They rested themselves on the seats . I peeped at their fingers which were laced with each other &#34;Awe you guys are really cute&#34;, I complimented them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Says the girl from the cutest couple &#34;&#39;, a quick smile escaped my lips. I tried to hide it as I looked away. Realizing our distance , Mr Reynolds shifted himself closer to me. Our arms touched which allowed a shiver to pass through my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see you maintain a lot of distance when in public&#34;, Cody shrugged as he giggled .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re just a very very introverted couple &#34;, he curled his hands around my waist . His proximity towards my body made me believe in butterflies. Oh my Lady Gaga, they definitely existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled as I rubbed the back of his hand &#34;True &#34;, I agreed to his sentence &#34;lets go baby &#34;, he pecked my cheek unexpectedly turning my natural blusher on. Why were his actions so unanticipated, I pouted as we walked towards our room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I placed the tub of chocolate ice-cream on my lap and turned on NetFlix. I entertained myself with adventure movies back to back till night, his attention was focused towards the laptop . I did check on him at regular intervals .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After having dinner I made myself comfortable on the couch as it was my turn tonight . I was alarmed from my sleep when I heard loud footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly opened my eyes and saw the man in agitation. I yelled out of my lungs on recognizing the figure, I at once uplifted myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James pounced on me with all his might , he had a revolver in his hand . He kept it on my head as he yanked the top of mine furiously. &#34;Mr. Reynolds, wake up&#34;, I screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hola bitch &#34;, he punched me in my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Reynoldsssss&#34;, I shrieked again. &#34;Aarooooooooon , wake up&#34;, my voice was louder this time. On sensing the consternation of my loud pitched voice he woke up and came towards me , his eyes were filled with dismay .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So let&#39;s kill Mr Reynolds first &#34;, he smirked as he pointed the revolver towards him . I tried punching him but my push didn&#39;t affect him a lot . He threw me on the couch when I tried pushing the revolver away from his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I saw him triggering the revolver I stood on my feet hurriedly and ran towards him &#34;Aarooooooooon&#34;, I shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a continuous slow tap on my cheek , I opened my eyes realizing that it was a dream . I wiped off the sweat from my forehead . That dream felt so real and horrid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could literally hear the thumping of my heart , I took deep breaths to calm myself down . I had my fingers intertwined with Mr. Reynolds&#39;s. He sat next to me on the couch and rubbed my back unceasingly with his other hand. I placed my temple on his forehead and found peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;you okay?&#34; he interrogated slowly as he wiped of the tears and gently stroked my cheeks with the back of his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am now&#34;, I tried controlling my tears but I couldn&#39;t. I held him tight and refused to let him go away. He didn&#39;t fail to solace me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw James &#34;, I took a deep breath &#34;What if the dream comes true ?&#34;, I looked at him as tears rolled through my eyes constantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t. Shush&#34;, he kept his fingers on my lips &#34;Sleep on the bed, I&#39;ll take-over the couch&#34;, he helped me stand up and walked me till the bed. After assuring that I laid comfortably he covered my body with the blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The filthy dream kept replaying in my mind again and again . Our fingers were yet intertwined and I denied to let go off it . &#34;don&#39;t go&#34;, I pulled him through his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t ever &#34;, he sat on the bed as he patted my forehead whilst tucking away the baby hair . I sighed as I felt safe because he was around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can have the bed&#39;s other half &#34;, I interrupted the silence , my voice shivered as I was yet in shock . He straightened his legs on agreeing to my proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes as an attempt to sleep, I felt a smooth touch on my forehead . He kissed me , he thought I was unconscious or unaware. He didn&#39;t know that I wad yet awake. I tried avoiding all the negativity and bad thoughts. I couldn&#39;t sleep so I just kept my eyes closed and relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr Reynolds had his hands on my stomach , he didn&#39;t keep them intentionally . I knew because when I cornered my eyes I saw him busy sleeping . I placed my hands on him and consoled myself through his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On slowly opening my eyes in the morning , I perceived that my head rested on his shoulder while my right hand sheltered itself on his chest . He had his left hand on my waist and his right on my shoulder. I gave my body a bit push to untangle myself from the cuddling position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t, I had to wake him up for that. He slept peacefully and I didn&#39;t really intend to wake him up. I gawked at his exceptionally alluring face for a while, he was flawless and I wanted him all by myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, I wanted him. There was no denying in it .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I should confess about my feelings to him, even if he doesn&#39;t reciprocates it . I was ready for the heart-ache even at the cost of rejection . I didn&#39;t really want to keep my feelings to myself . It&#39;s not necessary that when you give love, you get it back. Sometimes fate and destiny doesn&#39;t intends to bring people together but that shouldn&#39;t stop you from loving someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chuck Bass once said &#39;You don&#39;t give up on people you love&#39; and I was a firm believer in it. I refused to give up on the fact that I loved him. Tenderly, dearly and totally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today , at the masquerade ball I&#39;ll say my heart out . It would be easier because we&#39;d have our masks on so it won&#39;t be much of a difficult task. A quick blush took birth on my face as I virtually pictured out the scenario.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he opened his eyes, he was startled as my nose touched his chin. He let go off me slowly, I refused to make any eye contact as I was already embarrassed for pulling him in the bed with me. I marched towards the washroom and didn&#39;t turn behind even for once.</p>
