                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cornered my eyes whilst secretly looking at Mr. Reynolds. He was busy jotting down the points he considered important. He played with his pen when doing the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brought my awareness of the projector screen as soon as his eyes met mine. Why does he has to be so cautious all the time, don&#39;t be so attentive Mr. Richie Rich?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked straight in the direction of the man who was giving the presentation. Every time I had the urge to look at him, I&#39;d bring up an act like pushing my chair or viewing the surrounding through the window, yeah my actions were strange lately but I didn&#39;t have any control over them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You look different, Mr. Reynolds&#39;s words echoed in my ears. I tightened my lips so as to prevent myself from smiling and making a joke out of myself in front of so many people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I should compliment him? Don&#39;t be a fool, Amanda, he&#39;s busy focusing somewhere else. Stop acting like a fan-girl all the time and including the fact that the topic already ended a while ago, you&#39;ll have a tube-light moment. Train your reflexes instead. I was going mad and to be honest I didn&#39;t mind it at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The speech continued boring the shit out of me, thanks to the fact that I knew how to sleep with eyes open. I had no one to talk with so I decided to stay still and wait for the meeting to get over. I brought my attention in place when everyone stood up and shook each other&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a deal then &#34;, Mr. Reynolds shook Mr. Henry&#39;s hand. I stood in one corner without disrupting anyone. I greeted Cody when he came towards me and stood next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone started leaving the conference room one by one. The only people who were yet present were me, Mr. Reynolds, Cody, Mr. Henry, and his wife. Mr. Henry&#39;s wife looked beautiful in her maxi-dress. Her age was almost in the late 30&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are here and you no go for sightseeing, let me take you &#34;, her accent was Russian, it sounded so cute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello! Mrs. Henry &#34;, I greeted her &#34;Well--&#34;, I couldn&#39;t think of an answer. Sightseeing was actually a good idea but I knew that Mr. Reynolds would certainly be uninterested in it so I decided to tell her a plain no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah Aaron, why don&#39;t you take Amanda out &#34;, Mr. Henry tightened his tie as he spoke &#34;We&#39;re done with today already &#34;, he continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re fine, I guess &#34;, I replied instinctively as Mr. Reynolds didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;you both should definitely explore this beautiful place, its more like a village but it has an alluring scenic beauty &#34;, the couple smiled looking at each other &#34;We met here for the first time, I&#39;m glad life bought me here &#34;, he side hugged his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess Amanda wants to stay in the hotel &#34;, Excuse me, Mr Reynolds, you should ask my opinion first. I want to go out, I do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fake smiled at him, he knew what exactly it meant. The inner me wanted to start a fight this very moment but I had great control over my nerves. &#34;Plus, you&#39;ll have a gist of the place and the project once you watch it yourself &#34;, Mr. Henry was being pushy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did hit the right exact spot at the perfect time, Mr. Reynolds would never actually say a no to something which is related to business. I saw his facial expression and I sensed a &#39;yes&#39; already. He pushed his sleeves up &#34;fine, I&#39;ll take her &#34;, he concluded as he left, I followed him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, he didn&#39;t allow me to freshen up, I&#39;m glad I carried my purse to the conference room. It included my compact powder so I fixed my look whilst looking at the small mirror in my compact. We got into the car, I took the passenger seat and attached the seat belt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you should use GPS&#34;, I shrugged as I knew that he may not have any idea regarding the roads of this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need it &#34;, he cocked his brows at me and continued driving. Can he actually listen to me for once? One moment I wanted to kiss him and the other moment I had the desire to punch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the drive was silent, I didn&#39;t play music as I wasn&#39;t in a mood to. I looked outside the window, everything was so green and clean around. This place was silent, there weren&#39;t many vehicles on the road. I loved the silence which the atmosphere possessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time his thoughts clicked my senses I&#39;d indulge myself in thinking about different and way more beautiful things which included Nick Bateman, Francisco Lachowski, Zac Efron, etc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped the car unexpectedly, I almost pumped away from my seat. I&#39;m glad that I had my seat belts on. On taking a closer view I realized that Mr. Reynolds was already out of the car. I opened the door and followed him in his way out. I stood afar as I observed his actions, he was shaking hands with a tall muscular man. He had his sunglasses on, his body was huge. Very huge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Waters &#34;, he called me closer. I moved towards him at once and stood next to him. I looked at him, I am sure that a question mark would&#39;ve been visible from my facial expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s my personal detective, Mr. Caleb Stone &#34;, he also had a Bluetooth device connected in his ears. He nodded looking at me, I nodded back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Miss Waters, you still have the note which James dropped ?, Mr. Reynolds questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t, it&#39;s in our room. If I was to be informed, I would&#39;ve carried it along &#34;, I tried defending myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked straight in my eyes for a while and then focused his attention towards Mr. Stone &#34;I&#39;m glad I took a picture, I was well aware of the fact that my secretary was careless &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pouted feeling disappointed by his last line, I controlled myself so as to prevent myself from getting into a debate. &#34;Do you have any picture of that man ?&#34;, the detective questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t click pictures and keeping pictures of other people doesn&#39;t include in my interests as well &#34;, he was prone to complicating the sentence as a simple &#39;I don&#39;t have his picture&#39; could do justice to this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do &#34;, I grinned on thinking about the fact that I had something which Mr. Reynolds didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This &#34;, on swiping the innumerable pictures in my spam folder I stopped at a picture of me with James. I did regret a bit as I should&#39;ve shown a decent picture. Mr. Reynolds looked at the picture continuously, I pulled it away from his hand and handed it to the detective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, we weren&#39;t making out in the picture but his body was extremely close to mine. His hand rested on my stomach as he tightly held me closer to him. His chin was on my shoulder and he was smiling like an idiot. He forced me for this picture when we were in Pallapora town, I should&#39;ve not allowed him to use me so much back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With thoughts like these, I wanted to stab myself. I was such a fool, I maybe was so desperate for love that I agreed to trust the wrong guy. I was glad that I stopped him from taking the wrong step that night on the terrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This will help &#34;, he snapped the picture from his camera. &#34;The person who left the note yesterday, was he James ?&#39;, he questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, maybe. His back faced me &#34;</p>
