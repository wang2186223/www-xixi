                <p>&#34;Sorry, Sir!&#34;I apologized with a smile, just as Gina and France suggested. They believed that only sugar could cope up with the burns on the tongue due to chilly flakes. Their dialogues were lame yet hilarious. I secretly laughed in my mind whilst thinking about it. I tightened my lips so as to prevent myself from being showcased as an idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s your directory and phone sir, you can cross-check. All the contacts are precisely entered and are very accurate&#34;, I started walking towards him. My mind couldn&#39;t stop thinking about last night. I so wanted to ask him the question that why was my father&#39;s name marked with red while other contacts were just formally entered, but I just didn&#39;t have the courage to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood straight from his chair and took tiny steps towards me. I stopped walking at that very moment. I was just saving myself from the collision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give them to me, let me go through it&#34;, he grabbed the directory from my hand and the phone too after placing the directory on his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>SEDUCE HIM AMANDA, a voice came from my inner conscious but I just couldn&#39;t do it. I first needed to gather courage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least, question him about your father, I guess my subconscious was commanding way too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, can I ask you a question?&#34; I finally gathered courage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only if it&#39;s relevant enough&#34;, he smirked. The &#39;relevant&#39; word was getting a lot on my nerves lately. It always reminded me of my first day</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is my father&#39;s name in your directory?&#34; I grabbed the directory and opened the last page. I pointed towards the name and propelled it towards his direction so that he could have a clear view of the name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a brief view and replied &#34;Confidential information cannot be linked&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? I&#39;m no outsider to this company&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone except me is&#34;, he raised his right eyebrow, tore the page from the directory, crumbled it, and threw it towards the nearest bin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this means that I&#39;m not getting the answer &#34;, I obviously felt bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fair point well made &#34;, he smirked again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated his gut, I now knew that I didn&#39;t want to work in his company at all and I was definitely going to work over with Gina&#39;s and France&#39;s plan because this guy was emotionless and working with him was definitely not giving me any sort of mental peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chained up my bag and started walking towards the exit. I turned around and smiled cheerfully after looking at him. I was pretty sure that he was quite confused with the smile as his expressions denoted everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t stop but grin at the fact that Mr. Reynolds was already annoyed, like at least a bit, and I was 0.001 % successful in my mission. I informed Gina and France quickly about it. Rather than patting my back on my little victory, they replied, &#34;Don&#39;t be happy with the basics&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to think about another excuse, so as to make my entry possible in his cabin again, so as to irritate him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I completed eating my lunch meal as soon as possible and grabbed out a file from the pending work-slot, marked some lines with a marker, and made myself a bit presentable before entering his cabin again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I come in Sir &#34;, I knocked. I just hated asking him permission every time I wanted to enter. It felt like walking towards the path of being insulted again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Twice for a day, Miss Waters &#34;, my existence definitely affected him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked towards him slowly with a smile and carefully placed the file on his palms till he got a grip of it. I made sure he could feel my touch so I slowly and seductively separated my hands from his. The file was obviously a big hurdle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds had an expression which could be easily figured out. It went like WHAT-THE-FUCK-IS-THIS-GIRL-DOING</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re here for an afternoon walk so that you don&#39;t get a tummy tuck after eating more than required &#34;, Mr. Reynolds made a sarcastic comment. My closeness with his body was bothering him and was rejoicing me from within but a part of me was yet scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I am here for these contractual papers, I had to write letters to shareholders regarding it as decided in the annual general meeting but I couldn&#39;t understand these lines so I decided to grasp all the necessary information and knowledge from you&#34;, I paused for the time being and grabbed those papers, opened the page in which everything was marked, and came intimately close to Mr. Reynolds, our cheeks almost touched. I looked in his eyes and continued the statement &#34;For a brief conversation&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was really bad at making eye contact or maybe his focus rested on my lips. After every 2 seconds, his eyes traveled towards it, Francis once said that &#34;when a guy wants to kiss you passionately, he cannot stop adoring at your lips&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll explain to you&#34;, he departed himself and made the &#39;inch&#39; gap from 1 to 10 real quick. He was trying to refocus very hard. &#34;Why don&#39;t you sit on the chair Miss Waters &#34;, he signaled me towards the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, that&#39;ll create trouble for us to look at the papers together&#34;, I glided the vacant chair besides Mr. Reynolds&#39;s chair. No matter how much he tried to detach himself from me, but his tricks failed to work, every time. The game was totally on my favor today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This line&#34;, I pointed towards the line, pushing my body towards the file. During this process, my arms touched his arms and I could feel his good build body, it was hard and perfect. He pushed himself a bit away and I pushed myself closer to him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay give me a moment&#34;, he replied while reading those marked lines carefully. I stared at his face which was beyond perfection. The sunlight fell on his eyes and it shined bright. This time, I was the one who was distracted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is just simple English, Miss Waters &#34;, he faced towards, maintained some distance as he cleared his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, it&#39;s quite technical for me to understand&#34;, I looked straight in his eyes and not once broke the connection. The only question which took birth in my head was, am I turning into a local whore. But, then my inner self had a satisfying answer that, everything is okay in love and war and this was war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds looked towards the paper and read the line out loud &#34;Shareholders are entitled to a dividend only on their share capital invested by them wholly and not on the bonus shares unless they&#39;re issued before 12 months&#34; he looked towards me and explained &#34;This is a simple concept Miss Waters, the dividend is to be provided only on the share capital invested by them initially&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and acted like I understood the whole concept when in reality I knew it too. My acting skills were improving since I joined this place. Maybe, after getting removed from this place, I could be some leading female protagonist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed those papers again. Accidentally, my hand slipped by mistake and all the papers got scattered on the floor, this was not a part of the plan and I was annoyed because I had to go running around after every corner of this cabin to pick up those papers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly stood up and ran towards the papers. I took those papers and filed it carefully and then when I looked at Mr. Reynolds, I saw him observing me, maybe he was laughing at me from inside but trying hard to control or maybe he was just frustrated with my clumsy behavior because every day I did something or the other for which he had to pay for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m assuming you understood everything that I explained Miss Waters&#34; Mr. Reynolds questioned while working on his laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Thanks a lot! &#34;, I tried appreciating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked towards the main door with the files in my hand and then I heard &#34;Miss Waters&#34; again, I turned back and saw the devil&#39;s evilest face with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-what sir &#34;, I stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next time come with a better excuse Miss Waters&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pretended that I didn&#39;t understand anything so I questioned again &#34;I did not understand sir, pardon me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve read your CV. You&#39;ve done a course on the Share market. It&#39;s impossible for you to deny that you didn&#39;t understand that simple line&#34;, he raised his brows and continued &#34;Your grades are appreciable and so are your acting skills&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was really facing minor problems for understanding that concept&#34;, I defended myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not expecting any answers regarding any explanation about what made you lie, but next time stay careful as I am me and you are you&#34;, he started looking at his laptop again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may leave now&#34;, he stopped while doing his work and signaled me whilst pointing his fingers towards the exit. I hated his arrogance plus his inhuman nature raged my blood.</p>
