                <p>I then started looking towards everywhere at his place &#34;Let me help you with the tour of my small house&#34;, he exaggerated the word small. We both knew that he was just hyperbolizing the statement because his house was big enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure&#34;, I smirked. I then started walking beside him. He marched forward and I trailed him from the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my kitchen, I don&#39;t know how to cook but this place is very important&#34;, he opened the fridge, removed some chocolates, and threw it towards me. I caught them quickly and started eating it. They were extremely tasty. There was some sort of Arabic written over it so I figured out that these chocolates were imported.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you&#34;, I appreciated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Always&#34;, he pulled me closer and wiped off the chocolate which rested on my chin with his left hand seductively in a slow motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled dramatically stretching my lips forcefully. I then apart away from him, without creating much of a fussy moment, as I didn&#39;t want to add on my series of clumsy moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So are you planning to give me a tour of your gigantic house or are we just going to eat chocolates in your kitchen?&#34; I questioned while pulling him away from the kitchen, well, it wasn&#39;t one of those physical pulls. I tried pulling him out through my words. No, wasn&#39;t interested to make out with the-bad-guy-James, I just wanted to stalk the hell out of his house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or we can skip the house tour part and I can directly show you my bedroom&#34;, James smirked giving a hint of naughtiness on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How very intimate&#34;, I was straightforward enough to pull him down along with his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or maybe just romantic!&#34; he drew me closer through my arms. A thought escaped my mind, of skipping directly to the bedroom rather than wasting any more time in his house, so, I pulled the collars of his shirt and made my body touch his. I could feel the look on his face. He was definitely high, high on sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bedroom, eh...?&#34; I questioned by lowering my voice seductively and running the strap of my dress off the shoulders showing off a bit of cleavage. I could feel his sexual desires being charged up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course baby girl&#34;, he lifted me up in his arms and walked straight upstairs without stopping for a minute. I was scared and worried at the same time. I wanted to give up on this plan, but I also wanted to know the exact truth, to know that what actually was wrong with this guy, who is such huge deceit, and who is planning and plotting against the people I care about. I did care a lot about Mr. Reynolds, though he&#39;s been a pain in the ass lately. He&#39;s saved me when I required me and he certainly owed me a lot. Maybe, now was my time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the door of his bedroom, which had a massive bed with posters of bands and semi-naked girls. I twirled my eyes around and did quick breathing exercises in order to calm self down. He finally lifted me down carefully and without waiting for another second, pushed the dress down. His hands traveled from my arms to my waist. Only my black bra could be seen which showcased a huge amount of cleavage. He planted small kisses on my neck, on my collarbone, and sucked the upper part of my cleavage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation was gross, intimate, difficult, and uneasy. Whatever I intended to do had to be quick. I coughed dramatically, &#34;Can I have water?&#34; I questioned him. I first analyzed the room and made sure that there was no bottle or jug of water. After assuring myself, I brought up this act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James was alarmed by my coughing, so he stopped his hand gestures which were now making way towards my intimate areas. &#34;I&#39;ll get you water, easy baby girl!&#34; James started walking towards the kitchen which was downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept coughing but also looked around everywhere in his room for clues. I saw some papers after lifting the cushions of his bed. I quickly snapped each picture from my phone&#39;s camera and decided to read it after reaching home safely. After capturing each of those papers, I quickly placed them the same way as they were and turned around to see if I could find anything else which could help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a while, James was back with a bottle of water and an empty glass. He quickly emptied the water and gestured it towards me. I gulped the whole of it and took a seat on the bed. I placed my hands on my head pretending I was in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You okay, baby girl?&#34; he caressed my back and rubbed it continuously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest, I&#39;m not. Take me home, please. I guess I am having low blood pressure&#34;, I looked down and refused to make any further eye contact with him. His touch yet lingered in my body. The first thing I intended to do after reaching home was to wash my body thrice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay! Come on&#34;, he helped me with my moves so that I didn&#39;t collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry for spoiling this night&#34;, I made a guilty face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be&#34;, the rest of the journey was silent. I did spoil his horny mood after all. We reached my house after a couple of minutes. I waved him goodbye with a side-hug. He was sweet and cunning at the same time. I would&#39;ve definitely felt that love kind of feeling if I would&#39;ve been unaware of his evil double face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hopped on my bed after having a shower, as I mentioned thrice. I put on a comfortable nightgown. I placed my head on my pillow for a while to stable my position which was uneasy after being touched by that pervert. The touch wasn&#39;t one of those normal ones. It was one of an intentional one on my intimate areas, precisely my breasts and um, the part I shouldn&#39;t be talking about. I quickly detached my phone from the charger and decided to go through the pictured I discovered under James&#39;s cushions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was utterly shocked after looking upon my notifications. It read &#34;25 missed calls from Mr. Richie Rich&#34;. I quickly called him, realizing the trouble I was going to face paired with a 10-minute long sarcastic lecture. Finally, he picked up after it ringed three times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Miss. Waters, it&#39;s so good to hear your voice. You&#39;re definitely getting an incentive&#34;, I could sense the sarcasm from the other side of the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Sir! Is something urgent?&#34; I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, all those 25 calls contain good night messages for you, right Miss Waters?&#34; I knew that a straight answer was definitely not coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I apologize again&#34;, I kept silent for a while so that he gets some space to state reasons for the urgency at this hour of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you dating James?&#34; his question shook me because this was personal, plus I never thought Mr. Reynolds would actually care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me&#34;, I coughed &#34;this is personal&#34;, I offended.</p>
