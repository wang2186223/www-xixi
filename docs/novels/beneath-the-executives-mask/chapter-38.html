                <p>&#34;This water is quite muddy though &#34;, I filled my palm with some water showcasing the mud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If being a billionaire, I can have it for survival purposes then why not an ordinary girl as you drink it &#34;, he never failed to blab about his wealth but this time he actually made sense but I didn&#39;t want to express that to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That doesn&#39;t mean ordinary girls drink muddy water &#34;, I filled the water in my palms and took a sip of it &#34;To every ordinary girl &#34; I tossed. The water tasted salty but fine enough to compromise for the condition. I smirked at Mr. Reynolds and drank another sip of it . &#34;can I confess something honestly ?&#34;, I interrogated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes &#34;, he nodded signaling me to carry on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you hear some noise ?&#34;, I generally questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. What does it sound like ?&#34;, he questioned back so I pointed towards my tummy &#34;You hear the growl, do you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His facial expressions turned worse from the bad . I definitely needed to work on my lames when in Mr. Reynolds&#39;s presence. I never ever thought before speaking until it created serious circumstances . This quality was passed on to me from Francis, Gina always objected at our lames but ended up laughing anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you can shut up for a minute, I can think something &#34;, he wiped off the sweat from his face. The weather was very humid and moist, the sun shined brightly on top of my head causing it uneasy for us to walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;yeah, take up the lead &#34;, I directed him to move ahead. &#34;Don&#39;t forget I am hungry &#34;, I confirmed first that my face was turned towards his back before commenting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked for a while but then I stopped &#34;Oh my God Mr. Reynolds, look up there &#34;, I grabbed his hand preventing him from walking anymore. He looked towards the tree where red apples were hanging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re way too up &#34;, he tried jumping to behold the apple but failed miserably. He continued doing it but there were no successful results obtained through his actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me try &#34;, I jumped along &#34;Ouch &#34;, I shouted the moment my feet hit the ground, the pressure exerted doubled my pain so I just sat on the ground straightening my legs. Mr. Reynolds sat on his knee closer to me, he rubbed my legs warmly. It was effective indeed, the sprain on the joints of my toes reduced, I kept calm for a while and then stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about a team effort?&#34;, I raised my brows &#34;and thanks by the way &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I don&#39;t have the power to pick you up again so don&#39;t mention it and YES I know exactly what you mean, just stay calm, okay &#34;,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will&#34;, I nodded. Mr. Reynolds sat on the ground lowering his head. I parted my legs on either side and sat on his shoulders, my dress lifted up showcasing my upper thigh which touched his cheeks on either side. &#34;Careful please &#34;, I kind of doubt on his balancing skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move, unless told &#34;, he slowly and gradually stood up. I balanced myself trying hard not to move. Yes, our plan was effective . &#34;gotcha &#34;, I stretched my hands and plucked the nearest apple from the tree and threw it on the ground softly. &#34;Turn left &#34;, I commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you command Miss Waters &#34;, he warned me and later turned left after a few moments. I plucked two more apples jointly one by one. &#34;A little more left please &#34;, I asked him to shift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was infuriating which could be felt. I tried stretching my arms so that I could have one last apple too. I wasn&#39;t greedy for apples, I just wanted to pluck as much as possible to suffice our hunger for the rest of the journey until we reached home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A bit more please &#34;, my hand didn&#39;t reach that spot with much ease, as a result, I pushed my body towards the left side which resulted in the quivering of my balance. My legs glided through his back falling on the ground, exerting force on his body too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We fell down together as his head rested on the ground whilst mine rested on his chest. I could hear his heartbeats which got fastened up due to my clumsy act. I gathered all my courage to lift myself up and face him, I was shocked to see that Mr. Reynolds laid on the ground with his eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I at once parted my body away from his and examined him further closely. &#34;Maybe his head hit the ground with great force so he probably fainted, he will get back to his senses soon &#34;, I consoled myself. I rubbed his hands with mine, I basically didn&#39;t know what effect it has on someone but I couldn&#39;t think of a better option too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited near him for minutes placing his head on my lap and wiping off his excess sweat from the leaves which were scattered on the land as the leaves had water in it, so it had a soothing effect on one&#39;s skin plus excess heat could turn out to be dangerous causing serious issues such as lowering one&#39;s blood pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Mr. Reynolds, wake up please &#34;, tears started to roll through my eyes as I was the one solely responsible for this gloomy condition &#34;I even promise that I won&#39;t pass any more lame jokes or cause any trouble purposely &#34;, my voice shook while speaking because of my wail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do promise, eh ?&#34;, he slowly opened his eyes. I helped him to uplift himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re okay &#34;, I trailed my fingers through his messy hair slowly touching his cheeks. &#34; I am so glad that nothing happened to you &#34;, I pulled him closer to me into a hug caressing his back, our bodies touched. I suddenly realized that maybe I just got carried away a much more than normal after knowing he was fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey shush, I am fine &#34;, we parted and it was very awkward for me to behave in such a way for him. &#34;Why do I care ?&#34;, I questioned myself expecting an answer but there was none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest Miss Waters &#34;, he cleared his throat &#34;I was just kidding, nothing really happened to me. I kept my eyes close for a while but then you took the situation another way round so decided to playfully act in it &#34;, he stood up &#34;but then things got really intense with you panicking so I decided to speak up &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is to a completely another level &#34;, I punched him on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yet didn&#39;t match with your level of lames ha &#34;, he picked up the apples and gave half of them to me &#34;Now eat them, I can hear the voices from your stomach &#34;, I laughed on his humor to which he just smiled, cannot expect more too. I could feel our knots loosening every consequent day as I got to learn a new side of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where to, CAPTAIN ?&#34;, I took a bite of the apple, it was very sweet and juicy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How Melodramatic &#34;, he frowned faking a smile. &#34;Let&#39;s keep walking with a hope that we find the highway &#34;, he continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, let&#39;s make this walk interesting then. Let&#39;s play a game &#34;, I tucked my baby hair behind my ears &#34;The game is, A walk to remember. I am the host of course but we can play turn wise &#34;, I peeped at his face to figure his facial expressions whilst walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not really playing any games with you &#34;, he responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please -please -please &#34;, I set the word &#39;please&#39; on repetition mode. &#34;So is that a yes ?&#34;, I made a puppy face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No obviously &#34;, he raised his brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, then I won&#39;t walk anymore&#34;, I stood still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop behaving like a 4-year-old &#34;, he made eye contact &#34; plus you can stay here, I&#39;m unstoppable .&#34;, he kept walking without giving a damn about me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you &#34;, I ran to match till his speed &#34;I am so bored, what&#39;s wrong with being entertained though &#34;</p>
