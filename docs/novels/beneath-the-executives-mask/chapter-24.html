                <p>AMANDA&#39;S POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried my best to walk with ease and not mess up the white dress I was wearing. I felt grateful for not being on my periods as that could&#39;ve spoiled such a lovely dress and my mood could go from 10 to 0 real quick. I always dreamed about uncertain things like what would happen if the penis spilled off blood monthly but my thoughts were irrelevant, of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tussled up my gown and caught it firmly from my thighs pushing it a bit up so I could walk comfortably. I walked steadily towards Mr. Reynolds&#39;s cabin. It took me great efforts to walk in the long maxi dress. The lower material of the gown tangled up with my heels which caused my balance to shake every time I advanced my feet in the process of walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, after reaching Mr. Reynolds&#39;s cabin, I asked for permission. &#34;Can I, sir?&#34; I had no power to go back again and re-ask for permission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in Miss Waters &#34;, he was struggling with his tie too. I opened the door carefully and marched in, Mr. Reynolds looked more than perfect in his grey suit which he paired over a sky blue shirt. His dense dark blue eyes reflected the color of his shirt. His dark brown hair has partly highlighted a shade of blonde, precisely the upper part of his spikes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look at me as he was busy wearing his tie. He went towards the mirror after a while and modeled for some tiny seconds and then unfolded the tie and threw it towards the chair. He opened the top buttons of his shirt and looked at himself for a while and smirked. He looked extremely sexy, and I couldn&#39;t control my amorousness which arose within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned around towards me and we had the strangest eye contact. Our gazes locked with each other and no one amongst us dared to look away. It felt like I was stargazing, in a night where only the best stars twinkled. I was the first one to look around after an awkward moment. Mr. Reynolds yet stared at me, his eyeballs twirled around my body from, head to toe. I felt uncomfortable because a part of my cleavage was visible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You -you look p-p-p &#34;, he was stammering on the word p. My mind revolved around all the adjectives which could begin with the alphabet p, the first which came to my mind was pretty. He looked towards me again and continued &#34;Different, you look very different Miss Waters&#34;. I knew that saying the word &#39;pretty&#39; was something he&#39;d never do plus all kind of amazing adjectives weren&#39;t a part of his dictionary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look different too Mr. Reynolds &#34;, I returned the compliment which was not even a compliment but maybe it was kind of some good word in our extremely formal world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mess up&#34;, I knew it was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know! I won&#39;t&#34;, I assured. &#34;But since I have no idea about this modeling thing, it may take some time for me to register it in my mind&#34;, I continued after pulling my off shouldered dress up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go with the flow &#34;, he reassured. I nodded along and waited for him to come beside me or at least a bit close so that we could move on together towards the ground floor auditorium, when he was close enough I started walking along after catching my gown a bit upward again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were in the hallway walking towards the elevator silently. No one amongst us uttered any word. I was struggling with the dress and I knew that this problem could be only sorted if my balance was proper. When some baby hair rested on my temple, I let go of the grip of my hands over the dress and tried moving the unnecessary strands of it backward without spoiling the hairstyle much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the extra-long gown rolled through my toes because of the flare, I couldn&#39;t balance myself because of which there was a sudden call of gravity flow from the floor to my body. I was about to fall and desolate everything but something good happened, I was sheltered from my stomach through Mr. Reynolds&#39;s hands, they had a firm grip over me. He twisted his hands and bounced me back through his right hand whilst catching from the left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a basketball&#34;, I was yet in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But this dress and hairstyle sure cost a little more above your level &#34;, he talked monetary stuff again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pfft&#34;, I stood straight making that fussy noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s move a bit faster&#34;, he caught me through my arms so that I could catch my gown properly and walk without creating any more scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you &#34;, I looked towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer me and kept walking. We reached the auditorium within 10 minutes and I could already see a lot of shutterbugs. &#34;Help her&#34;, Mr. Reynolds handed me over to a long skinny girl who immediately caught me after listening to his orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds went towards some people and greeted them politely. I was taken to the green room by the tall girl. &#34;More makeup?&#34; I was shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, just some touch up&#34;, she puffed some amount of compact powder on my face making it look fresh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look amazing &#34;, she stared at me for a while &#34;and this broach at your back looks exotic&#34;, she kept complimenting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you!&#34; I smiled &#34;this broach is supposed to correct the flaws of this dress but um I&#39;m glad it looks attractive &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was signaled from outside, she told me to hurry up. I immediately got up from my place and prepared myself by doing some quick inhale-exhale yoga exercises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You okay?&#34; she finally questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be&#34;, I started walking towards the crowd. Mr. Reynolds looked at me and made some kind of facial expression which meant that I should go towards him and stand along with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept quiet for a while and stood silent next to Mr. Reynolds without interrupting a word. Mr. Reynolds was busy talking with the people which belonged to the media. He was asked all sorts of questions, his answers were witty and on point. He was very careful with the selection of his words because he was well aware of the fact that Electronic media could have good as well as ugly consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat was parched but I couldn&#39;t afford to move even a bit away from him, even for the purpose of drinking water, because I knew that my clumsiness and bad luck never left me alone and wherever I went, a wrong thing was sure to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So are you the new model of this company&#34;, a man came towards me and handed me the mike. Mr. Reynolds watched me through cornered eyes. I was confused by the question and I had no idea about the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I um &#34; I cleared my throat and looked towards Mr. Reynolds. My facial expressions could be read easily, they were &#34;HELP&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since me and my company truly believe in women empowerment and progress&#34;, Mr. Reynolds pulled the mike towards him&#34; I wanted to be showcased in the cover -magazine with someone who had sheer knowledge about this company and not just some good-looking model&#34;, I sighed out of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So who is she?&#34; the person questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you guys seeing each other&#34;, another person from the media questioned tending to make it breaking news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never heard of her before&#34;, a girl looked at me whilst traveling her eyeballs through my dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can the questions come out in a systematic manner&#34;, Mr. Reynolds almost locked their mouth. I couldn&#39;t stop but stare at him, his half torso could be seen from the side as I was standing right next to him. It was strongly responsible for diverting my attention towards other people</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Point No 1 - she is my secretary, Point No 2- it was always professionalism what has impacted my growth so personal questions are subject to remain unanswered. Point No 3 - she just started working&#34; he looked at everyone around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So how is it working with him?&#34;, a man questioned me with his eyes focused on my cleavage, I wanted to cut his eyeballs and feed them to the goats but I somehow controlled my discomfort and anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s a pleasure working with him. I have never seen a man so focused and motivated on his goals in my entire life &#34;, I looked at him while answering, everything I said was true, I later continued &#34;He not only leads us but also guides us in the humblest manner, he respects all of us, and never disrupts our personal life&#39;s space&#34;, I lied clearly with the latter line and gave a cute smile looking at Mr. Reynolds, he looked impressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled me closer towards him asking for my hand, I did the same as soon as possible without any hesitation. &#34;We are done for tonight &#34;, it was a signal for them to pack up and leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed because I cleared level one successfully and now I was admitted to Level 2. Level ups are meant to give us bipolar feelings. We become happy because we succeed and sad because another level turns out to be more difficult as compared to the initial one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An entire stage was set up for us, there were lights focusing in the middle of the stage. The background was amazing enough to turn lunatic for. It had amazing paintings across it. Mr. Reynolds came close to me and his lips almost touched my ears. He whispered, &#34;All the best &#34;. Every time he came close to me, I felt something strange, I felt some creature tickling in my stomach and I refuse to take those creatures like butterflies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a guide present there to help us with positioning in front of the camera. His extra colorful dressing was exotic, and he seemed gay, he was one too. I could figure that out because he was leaning on Mr. Reynolds&#39;s body more than me. He was getting extremely touchy with him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stand still &#34;, he ordered me and I positioned myself that very moment. He placed a chair in the middle of the stage and told Mr. Reynolds to sit on it comfortably. Mr. Reynolds obeyed his directions precisely. He pulled me towards Mr. Reynolds and placed my right hand very gently on his shoulders and the left hand was occupied by the back portion of his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was scared, but I definitely tried to hide those facial expressions from my face, I acted calm and pleasant like I was chilling out in Hawaii. Hawaii was one of the favorite places I always longed to visit. My head was positioned just a few distances away from Mr. Reynolds&#39;s face, my nose almost touching his cheek.</p>
