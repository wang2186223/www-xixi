                <p>I was alerted from sleep at 10 am because of the continuous beep from the alarm clock. I shut it down by pushing off the stop button. Yeah, after losing my phone I managed to take a new one at an affordable price. I ported the same number by lodging a complaint at the customer care, I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t much of a procedure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, I&#39;m sorry I lost all my contacts. May I know who&#39;s this ?&#34;, I picked up the phone which vibrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh ! This is supposed to be the person you totally forgot about. How long will it take for you to recover, I&#39;ve been through the same state as you but I joined the very second day after returning. I guess you really want me to cut down your salary &#34;, anger could be felt in his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh! Mr -- &#34;, I paused for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah! Mr. Reynolds &#34;, he sounded angrier now &#34;Oh that&#39;s me wow. Come straight to the point Miss Waters, do not think about an excuse in the meanwhile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I punched my pillow out of anger and continued &#34;I&#39;ll see you in a while---&#34; I heard a beep, taking a quick view I realized that he already hung up. I frowned and saved his contact as &#39;Mr. Richie Rich&#39; and hopped in the bathroom for a shower as it was the time to flush away the wrong happenings of the past and focus on the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wore a brown shirt and paired it with beige skin-fit jeans. I twirled a scarf around my neck as it was very cold out. I pushed some raw sandwiches in my mouth before taking an exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck &#34;, I yelled due to the immense pressure on my body by two torsos. On examining closely I couldn&#39;t control my grin as it was Gina and Francis. I hugged them back tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woah, paying me a visit this early. Quite impressive &#34;, I was being sarcastic no doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We inquired about you, your mother suggested us to stay away as she wanted you to have your lone time during rehab. Yet, I apologize &#34;, Gina sounded low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, I totally believe in you. Tell me what all I missed this week &#34;, we walked towards Francis&#39;s car as he took over the driver seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cars are turning out to be scary for me now &#34;, my mind escaped in a flashback and then fell back to normal. &#34;Drive slowly and safely &#34;, I advised Francis as I and Gina took the back seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;tell me everything I missed &#34;, I tried diverting my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gina&#39;s cheek reddened &#34;I - um got official with Samuel &#34;, a smile escaped her lips and she looked towards the window blushing. I coughed paving her out of her thoughts so she continued &#34;he decided to let everyone know as we took another step already &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Another step umm &#34;, Francis mimicked making her embarrassed. I pinched him on his arm so that he&#39;d stop teasing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was your first time pleasant ?&#34;, I was curious now, Gina focused on my questions nicely now. I could feel her happy like very very happy. They say your face glows when in love, now I know why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Gina&#39;s third love interest, not that I am judging her. I had proposals in the past too, some were very interested in me and I liked some of them too but I ruined every opportunity because of my stubbornness and ego. Now is the time when I don&#39;t believe it may be because of my last love interest. &#39;Stupid story&#39;, I pinched myself getting out of my dream world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was kind of funny, he couldn&#39;t locate the c-c&#34;, she stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The clit ouch, I told you that I&#39;m good at bed but you had to do it with him &#34;, his voice sounded like a dramatic neighbor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Francisssssss &#34;, Gina&#39;s voice echoed in the car, it was so loudly infuriating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess I&#39;ll shut up now. So how did he manage after locating the clit &#34;, he sounded curious in a bad way so that he&#39;ll burst out in laughter on her next sentence but to my surprise, he didn&#39;t. We listened to the rest of the story without passing any judgment. We did laugh at times but it was okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough of me, tell me about you now. What did you do when you were apart &#34;, Gina looked puzzled, I couldn&#39;t sense Francis&#39;s expression as he was driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that it was my turn now so I initiated from the start and told them how he rescued me from the garage kinda woody house, how we ended in the jungle, and how we roamed around searching for a stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cut it, tell us did he get cozy with you &#34;, Francis never left an opportunity to speak dirty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was coming to that, can you just zip your filthy mouth and listen to my story &#34;, I narrated the whole incident, Francis was so desperate to capture my expressions that he stopped the car and parked it on the left side of the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just like a fairy tale prince &#34;, Gina&#39;s mind was revolving around one princess tale by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you know fairy tales are overrated &#34;, I contradicted her statement &#34; and just so you know that he was back to being the old he on our return journey to home so whatever feelings I gained for him terminated that very second.&#34;, I sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming to the tragic part I added seriousness to my tone and then recited everything which connected his father to mine. Their facial expression defined agitation and confusion but they managed to plaster it with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let things go how they are destined to &#34;, Gina suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just what I thought &#34;, Francis pushed the music button on so as to calm the seriousness in the atmosphere. He dropped me to my office minutes later and they both waved me final goodbyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I straightened my shirt and tucked the portion which loosened a bit, I folded my scarf as smallest as I could and zipped my bag after placing it in. I was scared to enter the office, not that I haven&#39;t been scared earlier but this was supposedly different. A shiver ran through my spine on reaching the elevator, it reminded me how I met James here for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scared me more than lizards if that explains my fright towards him. I pushed the &#39;7&#39; button so as to reach upon the floor. I folded my arms and stood stiff waiting to arrive at my destination. I marched out at once reaching the floor, threw my bag in my cabin, and penetrated out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;can I come in ?&#34;, I knocked on the door slowly waiting for a reaction. I still remember how he told me to re-enter when I forgot to knock so asking permission was now turning into a habit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get in &#34;, I heard a seductive voice so I just let out my sensuous thoughts and walked in.</p>
