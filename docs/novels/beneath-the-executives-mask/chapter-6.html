                <p>I felt a bit uneasy so I examined myself too. Let me really make this statement that, Mr. Reynolds looked highly intimidating in his hot black suit paired with a white shirt and a black tie. His hair was spiked a bit, and his blue eyes shined. He had those Greek God looks and ugly nature. Mom always said that what mattered in a person was always his nature and not looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw him turning apart. I quickly went towards my cabin. There was a parcel on my table. I went closer to it for further examination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a huge box. I figured out that there may be some kind of clothing in it. After opening the parcel, I was not shocked being that there was a dress in it. A white well-ironed shirt and a black pencil skirt. It looked quite elegant and professional but also boring. On the topmost right portion of the shirt, there was a batch that included my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly removed my knee-length red dress and kept it on the chair and wore the dress which was in the box. I pushed my skirt a bit up so that it looked fashionable too. I didn&#39;t really want to wear a dress but I had to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After carefully pinning the batch near my chest, I tied a ponytail out of my hair which made my look neat as the outfit did not really match my previous hairstyle, which was kind of casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thoroughly took a view of my look and marched fast towards the ballroom, I made sure I balanced myself properly on my 3 inches high sandals. After revolving around the place, I realized that there were some girls who were wearing the same dress as me. I knew something was suspicious and my boss was definitely up to something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Amanda&#34;, the new receptionist came towards me, waving. She looked lovely with a cute pink tee and a red pleated skirt. Many questions were arising in my mind, &#39;WHY isn&#39;t she following the same dress code as me as if she was to be the employee in the same firm.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something at that moment knocked me down. Something which made me felt awful, inside out. Something because of which I could not make eye contact with anyone present in the ballroom. I for a moment felt ashamed for taking up this job in which I didn&#39;t fit in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the waitresses at the party were wearing the same dress as me. I was surely monetarily unstable but my mom would never want me to do this, now I knew that I had to. I respected every variety of professions, no offense but this was not something I was paid for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly made eye contact with Mr. Aaron Reynolds. He evilly smirked after looking at me because the word &#34;smile&#34; was something that had no place in his dictionary. I knew that it was his plan to insult me so loud in public so that I couldn&#39;t look in my eyes when facing the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did expect cheap traits from him but never expected him to start them this early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, an old man came and handed me a tray, full of glasses of liquor and that&#39;s not it, he even scolded at me by saying &#34;You aren&#39;t paid for standing still and looking at pretty faces, you coward&#34;, his scream was loud and clear enough for people to hear. I looked down, towards the floor as I felt ashamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not paid for this job anyway&#34;, I said to myself and took that tray from his hand. I could&#39;ve offended. I chose not to. I knew that these were the very first days of my work. I had to go through everything and make a mark. He was testing me or maybe irritating me, I just had to pass with good marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey girl, Get me a glass!&#34; Some nasty rich brat ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here, sir&#34;, I gave out one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unquestionably, I wanted to hit him right in his head because everything he was doing was examining the size of my boobs. I felt uneasy of course but I maintained a grip at my temper too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Far from my place, I saw a man, his vision to me was blurry but when I could clearly see him I was so sure that they were my friends, my best friends. After seeing them my whole world started collapsing because the least I wanted was them to see me dress up completely like a waitress and do the job of one too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started taking long steps, increased my walking speed to make sure I was totally and completely out of sight from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then dang it! My balance with the tray shook up and all the glasses collided with the floor breaking instinctively with liquor spilled all over the floor. No matter how much I tried to balance out things, everything in my life always got out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not have the courage to raise my head and look at Mr. Reynolds, Francis, Gina, or the innumerable crowd present in the ballroom. When I finally gathered the courage to look up, unsurprisingly, everyone was already looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Francis and Gina were coming towards me and Mr. Reynolds didn&#39;t seem to care. He had this face which said: &#34;I-WAS-EXPECTING-SUCH-KIND-OF-MISHAP-FROM-THIS-GIRL&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned over to some vacant place and no, I did not pick up the mess off the floor. I had some self-respect after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see my best friends coming towards me. The closer they came, the more emotional I got. I hated to display my emotions but I could not control them too. Then, when they were just inches away, my eyes started watering. I wiped them away before they could travel through my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, hey, hey! It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s okay. Shush, it&#39;s just us baby girl&#34;, Gina wiped out the remaining tears and Francis removed his handkerchief and offered it to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you doing this Amanda? I thought you were appointed here as a secretary?&#34; Francis questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am! It&#39;s one of my boss&#39;s dirty tactics to annoy me&#34;, I reverted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dickhead, I&#39;ll go and cut his balls right away&#34;, anger was clearly felt in Gina&#39;s tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you guys here?&#34; I changed the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father had an official invitation and we thought we&#39;d surprise you&#34;, Francis answered, his eyes met mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awe that&#39;s so sweet of you both but I&#39;d be happier if you guys could go and join the fresher&#39;s party again as I would not be comfortable working as a waitress in front of your eyes&#34;, I pushed them away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gina kissed my cheek, &#34;Remember we love you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yea, yea we do&#34;, Francis kissed the other one, and then they left. I watched them leave and I did not stop them as personally I wanted them to enjoy their time at the freshers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved towards the bartender&#39;s corner to pick the tray up. This time I was more careful than before. I took every step carefully. A man in his mid 30&#39;s called me from the right corner of the ballroom where there was a lesser crowd. There were hardly any people out there. I went towards him and offered him the tray so that he could pick up a glass of his choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On grabbing the whole tray from my hand, he kept it on the closest table. I wondered what his intentions were but whatsoever they were, I could figure out he had something dirty running in his mind. He fetched my wrist with his right hand and rubbed his fingers on my palm. I knew what this sign meant. Francis had told me about this, it meant: Can-you-have-a-nightstand-with-me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get away you pervert&#34;, I pushed him away screaming. He came extremely closer to me. He grasped my wrists and pulled it whilst dragging me away from the ballroom, towards the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not now baby, you have this beautiful face and body. I&#39;ll help you make the most of it, just wish on an amount and it&#39;s yours. All you have to do is be pleasurable tonight&#34;, He grabbed me by my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could not move an inch. He held me hard against him, I tried pushing him away. The harder I pushed, the closer he tugged me to him. &#34;I&#39;m not a sex slave, I work here. Please let go off me&#34;, I begged of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not today. I promise you&#39;re gonna enjoy it as much as I do&#34;, he started dragging me away from the crowd. We were out of the ballroom by now and there was not one person nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just inches away from me. His body was held tight against mine. He was about to place his lips on mine when suddenly someone punched his face. My vision was blurry because I was crying at the panic of being raped, because of the anxiety of not having my first time as per my wish, and also the fear of losing my virginity to someone unknown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I wiped my eyes I saw that Mr. Reynolds was the one. He scolded at that man whilst pulling him towards his direction through his collars. He punched him on his face. The pervert&#39;s nose started bleeding and a part of me wanted to dance from inside on seeing his wreck. Mr. Reynolds pointed towards the outside door which was a signal for that man to leave the party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go home now, you&#39;re done for today&#34;, Mr. Reynolds turned and looked at me for some seconds and then started walking towards the ballroom again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I synchronized with his walking speed and held his hand from back. He then turned around towards me. I intertwined both of my hands with the fingers of his right hand and appreciated him by saying &#34;Thank you, sir!&#34; and left the ballroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds was a person with multiple personalities. He hated me, created trouble for me but yet saved me. His actions and words confused me. My head started aching after what I faced today, I had to sleep and flush off all the thoughts I had in my mind.</p>
