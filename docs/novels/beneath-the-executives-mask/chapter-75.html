                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes trying to avoid the humanly figure which stood in front of me. I refused to tilt my chin up and have an encounter with the person. I dried my face with my palms and took a deep breath to prevent myself from crying anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please , don&#39;t do this to yourself&#34;, he leveled himself by sitting on his knees along with me. I declined to make an eye contact with him , I didn&#39;t have the power to , anymore. I took deep breaths to keep my nerves in control .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned away , diverting my body and attention. Why couldn&#39;t he just leave me alone like this . I needed to stay alone and cry my heart out. I didn&#39;t want his attention anymore . I stayed numb for the meanwhile and looked at the sky . My throat was parched , I needed water .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said , I wasn&#39;t involved with him after realizing you weren&#39;t substandard like your father. I tried stopping James . I couldn&#39;t , I apologize, Miss Waters .&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, You&#39;re apologizing now . Wow . Just wow&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do whatever it takes&#34;, his reply was dim .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah , you helped someone rape my sister ,take her innocence . In the age where she should&#39;ve abort lectures , she&#39;s aborting her child. Because of you. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For fuck&#39;s sake , it wasn&#39;t rape . Samarrah agreed to it , it all happened with her consent . I know she was hurt , any girl would be who&#39;s madly in love with someone , who carries a child of some person and then that individual just leaves her. I realized my mistake sooner or later. On knowing the fact that why I did it , you&#39;ll consider me less of a culprit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I warned James but he had some other thing planned which you&#39;re well aware of. &#34;, he paused &#34;Now , the least I expect is a silent treatment from you, speak up .&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly do you want to listen . Want me to say those consoling words to you , well then , your bad. LEAVE ME ALONE &#34;, I pulled myself up and started walking towards the opposite direction of the car. After all this nuisance I couldn&#39;t go in the same car with him . I didn&#39;t care if James traced me down , he was the same type of monster like him anyways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking longer steps then usual I tried running away from the situation, from him . I was ceased to walk any further by my wrists , his hands were curled around my arms and he endeavoured me to face him .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even attempt&#34;. I tried yanking away his hands from my upper arms, I failed because my strength didn&#39;t match his but that didn&#39;t stop me from pulling away so I recontinued my effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled me closer to him , rubbed away the tear which rested on my cheeks with the help of his thumb. When I looked in his eyes, I got lost . They didn&#39;t seem truthful to me anymore. I was devastated by his lie , every nerve in my body was electrified by hate because of his gypped act in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What now ?&#34;, he interrogated tucking away my hair lock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get off me , asshole &#34;, I attempted to get away from him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re out of your mind , it&#39;s okay &#34;, he assured me in a calming tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Out of my mind . Fuck yourself . You&#39;re a complete dick and a prick . I hate you , I hate you so much . Never knew how the antonym of some adjective could switch places with the former one this easily&#34;, I yelled in annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The antonym of hate ? Miss Waters ?&#34;, he tightened his lips to avoid himself from smiling . I could see it clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate you , that&#39;s what matters. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t .&#34; he paused for a while &#34;No , you don&#39;t&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do. I hate yo--- &#34;, he didn&#39;t allow me to speak as he rested his lips on mine after cupping my cheeks in his hands. He pulled me closer and shredded his fingers in my hair . I couldn&#39;t move , he was the obstruction I couldn&#39;t move because of. He compressed his lips on mine slowly , he sucked my bottom lips and asked for entrance .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The touch of his lips on mine was soft , he prevented himself from doing it roughly . He took the slow move . My eyes widened in shock as my hands hung straight loosely . Neither did I catch him nor pulled away . It felt like every nerve in my body ceased to function , like my reflexes were still .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pursed my lips tightly , made sure to not kiss him back. I had no idea what else to do this moment . My heart was having a battle with my brain which directly varied with the water which escaped my eyes. I could feel him breathing when he started to kiss me intensely .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I , with the help of my teeth crunched his lip , he gasped and I pulled away . &#34;Why did you just do that ?&#34;, an &#39;o&#39; took birth on my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do what? Kiss you ? I aspire to do that a lot often and I&#39;m not sorry for that&#34; , he paused &#34;I didn&#39;t have any choice Miss Waters . It was the only way to stop you , now please don&#39;t get mad at me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you ever do that . In fact , don&#39;t you ever show me your face again &#34;, I turned around and started walking avoiding him . After a while , I couldn&#39;t walk , my speed was terminated by Mr Reynolds as he firmly held my wrists in his hands and pulled me closer. I pouted whilst thumping on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not going to accompany you for the further journey, you can proceed without me &#34;, I concluded my decision and didn&#39;t really wait for him to approve it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He faced me , his hands tightly gripped around my wrists. &#34;Are you kidding me ? Get in the car , Miss Waters &#34;, I turned my head from left to right simply meaning a no &#34;Get inside the car , Miss Waters , don&#39;t force me to do things&#34;, he repeated his decision .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry &#34;, I tried yanking away his hands to free myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, he lifted me up in his arms . My stomach rested on his shoulder , I laid in an upside-down position . How can he pick me up , I wished I was good at karate back then . I punched him continuously on his back as an attempt to acquire riddance. I knew if I tried acting smart by shaking the balance , my body would rest on the ground resulting into brokerage of one or more bones plus his hands were tightly curled around my ass fixing a grip on my body because of which I couldn&#39;t locomote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Free me this very moment , this is kidnapping . I&#39;ll sue you once you place me down &#34;, I yelled out of my lungs but to my discontent no one could hear our voices except the both of us &#34;Mr Reynolds, I&#39;m warning you &#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;yeah , kidnapping . For your welfare and benefit &#34;, I couldn&#39;t see him , just hear his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t force me to call the cops &#34;, I tried warning him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh really ? Remember the last time you tried ? Did it work ? Well, go ahead and do that but after reaching my mansion &#34;, he opened the car&#39;s door and placed me inside softly . He curled the seat belt around me and locked the car with the help of a remote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned towards the back seat , there was a small locker beneath the seats . I cornered my eyes and examined his movement. After removing a handcuff , he surrounded it around my wrists and locked it by twisting the small lock . My hands collided with each other because of the pressure of the handcuff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t fucking torture me like this &#34;, I inhaled sharply in annoyance.</p>
