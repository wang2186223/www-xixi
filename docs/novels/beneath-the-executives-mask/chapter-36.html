                <p>&#34;I lost him , we all lost him. We all were river crafting then there was this huge storm &#34;, he extended his arms to show how big the storm actually was, &#34;he got carried away and he never returned. We did our best to find him but couldn&#39;t find any clue about him, I um &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah you do miss him &#34;, I continued his sentence. &#34;okay, my turn &#34;, ask me anything and I agree to reply it as honestly as I can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gawked at me for a while. His blue eyes looking as mysterious as ever . &#34;Have you ever been kissed ?&#34;, he looked in my eyes then his eyeballs traveled towards my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um.. yes of course&#34;, I uplifted my body to sit, he did the same eventually. I tried to divert my attention by looking at the moon. He came extremely close to me, our bodies almost touching. He segregated the baby hair on my face by placing them behind my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are beautiful, Miss Waters &#34;, He smiled at me . I could now feel his breadth, our nose almost touched, his eyes demanded to look at them forever and I didn&#39;t even want to object at this demand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands were on either side of my head rubbing off the unwanted baby hair. His lips were inches away so I whispered &#34;for real?&#34;, he gave me a small peck on my lips showing his desperation for doing the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-uh &#34;, I was stopped as Mr. Reynolds gently placed his lips over mine softly asking me permission. I reciprocated the action signaling him a yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His left hand rested on my lower neck whilst his right hand traveled behind my back and also ventured in the hair land charging me up romantically. He slowly and gently applied pressure on lips with his. I kept my lips soft and slightly parted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept placing small kisses on my lips, his hand lightly rested on my chest. I slowly moved my hands and rested them on the side of his shoulders which as a result made us come extremely close to each other. Our bodies touched in an intimate way which turned him on, he started to unbutton his shirt. He didn&#39;t remove it completely but kept it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips rested on mine again encountering my tongue which collided roughly in the beginning but then was at ease, his hands kept doing movements up and down my spine. After like 10 seconds, I pulled apart. &#34;Maybe we should stop &#34;, I kind of enjoyed and regretted the whole kissing thing. I couldn&#39;t pick one side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should &#34;, he stood up and pulled me towards him whilst he walked crookedly towards the hut. I held him through his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you are going to regret this in the morning &#34;, I uttered in a low tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you say something ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well! Nothing, what do we have Mr. Reynolds ?&#34;, I questioned back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t want to &#34;, he lied on the ground next to me resting his right hand on my body. &#34;You&#39;re my cute teddy bear &#34;, he whispered before falling back to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked towards the strawed ceilings for a while and thought about the unimaginable things like developing affection towards this man. I just wished that things fall back for Mr. Reynold&#39;s how it was when he enjoyed life. I wished I could glue up all the broken pieces in his life and make it right again but somethings are destined to be how they really are. That&#39;s what God has planned for us and that&#39;s what we shouldn&#39;t question about. I closed my eyes after gazing at the man who was completely cuddling me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the actual fuck &#34;, I heard Mr. Reynolds shrieking in my ears. I opened my eyes whilst rubbing them to get a clear picture of the scene. I tried moving away but I realized that my hairs were interlocked with the third button of Mr. Reynold&#39;s shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I punched him in his stomach lightly &#34;stop moving, you&#39;re hurting me and next time use appropriate words in the morning which could make someone&#39;s day rather than the cussed ones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; How is my morning suppose to be nice when I woke up with you, well precisely &#34; he cleared his throat &#34;, my body was on yours and I am half-naked, what is that suppose to mean Miss Waters &#34;, he was exasperated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried unlocking my hair from his shirt first, I continued doing it for a while but couldn&#39;t find any accurate result. The more I tried, the more complicated the knot resulted in. &#34;Will you mind Mr. Reynolds if I just break the third button of your shirt ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled off the button himself &#34; Why would I mind being freed ?&#34;, his rhetorical questions were infuriating my cool-nerves all the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Coming to the topic, what happened exactly last night ? &#34;, he furrowed his brows. I kept silent for a while knowing about the apprehensive consequences. &#34;Wait! Did you take advantage of me&#34;, he buttoned his shirts surrounded by anxiousness all over his face &#34;specifically, did you rape me when I was out of my senses ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck &#34;, I tried avoiding the cuss language &#34;Come on Mr. Reynolds, why would I want to break my virginity with you. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You say it like I&#39;m substandard&#34;, he completed buttoning himself, the third button&#39;s place showed some amount of his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were uncontrollable yesterday, you should thank me for protecting you&#34;, I wondered for a while that I should tell him about our kiss or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you protected me whilst kissing me &#34;, he broke the silence</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me, you kissed me &#34;, I disagreed by cutting his sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was out of my senses, you should&#39;ve stopped me but maybe you wanted to be kissed too &#34;, he acted like a complete douche-bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped backward &#34; I drank some too, my head was heavy. Maybe my emotions drifted with the flow, you can&#39;t blame me, in fact, I am supposed to blame you&#34;, I pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened after we came in the hut, did we do anything ?&#34;, he sounded curious &#34;DAMN! I don&#39;t remember anything after we came here .&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything ?&#34;, I repeated the word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what I mean, did we fuck each other?&#39;, he sounded obvious now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course yes &#34;, I provoked but then cleared up &#34; No we did not, Last night never happened, can we agree to that ?&#34;, I waited for a positive reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; It never did but you are a bad kisser&#34;, he chaffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shut up Mr. Reynolds, I wasn&#39;t much impressed by your kissing skills too &#34;, I offended but never meant anything that I said. Mr. Reynold&#39;s kiss was deep, passionate, and amazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came closer &#34; I know you don&#39;t mean it, let&#39;s keep going before James hunt us down. &#34;, he changed the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dusted myself, tied my hair into a bun by strangling by lower hair towards the middle ones, I had no clip or band so I had to adjust. &#34;Where do we head &#34;, I walked beside Mr. Reynolds pointing towards the ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should walk towards the right way &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think left would be appropriate &#34;, I disagreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;R-I-G-H-T &#34;, he exaggerated every word of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;L-E-F-T &#34;, I did the same thing keeping my opinion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Its either right or we just part our ways . &#34;, he sounded rude and bossy which was basically his nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! I&#39;ll go left .&#34;, I wanted to prove him wrong because he certainly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll call you when I reach home safely &#34;, he smirked &#34;Oh no, they broke the phone you got from your first salary&#34;, he was back to being sarcastic obviously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll give you a signal whilst looking at the moon, you love it right?&#34;, I completely covered my mouth after saying it. I was guilty as I didn&#39;t really mean to bring things from his past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynold&#39;s completely ignored the words which felt out of my mouth considering them irrelevant, maybe he was affected but he chose not to showcase it. &#34;I apologize&#34;, I shouted expecting no answer from this stubborn creature. He kept walking towards the right side without even turning behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I focused my attention on the left, recited my prayer, and marched.</p>
