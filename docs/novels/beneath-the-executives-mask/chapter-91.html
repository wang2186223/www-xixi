                <p>He pushed himself away, away from me. He interlocked our hands whilst keeping his touch, whilst giving me all the feels which could lead to irresistible butterflies. I licked my lower lip as he distanced his lips as an attempt to speak. It felt like he wanted to say something but couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want for your birthday&#34;, he smiled lightly, his eyes shined as he messily pushed his hair back into a spike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped, and answered &#34;The truth&#34;, I really wanted to know things. If he couldn&#39;t provide me with the answer then I was ready to do everything what it takes to lead me to the path of truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish I could tell you. It isn&#39;t as easy to say as it seems, you&#39;ll know it someday but that day wouldn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be your birthday&#34;, why was it so difficult anyways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t really in a mood to debate so I didn&#39;t dig much. &#34;Coffee?&#34; he tried changing the topic into a completely different phase. I nodded meaning a yes. &#34;I&#39;ll bring some then&#34;, he turned away loosening his grip over my fingers. He turned around making me face his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll come along&#34;, I strolled slowly behind him towards the kitchen. Oh, my dress and look wasn&#39;t really the &#39;kitchen type of&#39;. If only I could change into my nightdress because the servants threw daggers at me. On resting out feet on the kitchen&#39;s floor, he wore the apron. Was he going to make coffee, really?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He poured milk in the machine, added coffee in the basket and pinched on the button. &#34;I&#39;ll handle it myself&#34;, he directed the cook to leave the kitchen indirectly. He did the same within a couple of minutes. The coffee was ready. Mr. Reynolds didn&#39;t really remove the vessel nor the irrelevant apron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you tried making it earlier?&#34; I interrogated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows were furrowed. He stared at the machine for a while and then gathered his attention completely towards me. &#34;It&#39;s ready, I guess&#34;, I broke the silence when he ignored my question. I knew that he had no idea how to really make it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I do know&#34;, he poured the coffee equally into both of our mugs. He propelled the mug towards my direction. I sipped some coffee, it was without sugar plus he poured some extra coffee which made it taste extremely bitter. &#34;How&#39;s it?&#34; he interrogated settling his mug on the kitchen&#39;s table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love it&#34;, I faked a smile and lies. Some lies were better than bitter truths and this was one heck of a bitter truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes whilst gulping the whole of the coffee in one sip. The more time I took, the more trouble my taste-buds would encounter. &#34;I knew it&#34;, he winked. After taking a sip, he puked that instant. I laughed whilst taking a view of his facial expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you even drink this shit&#34;, he emptied the mug&#39;s coffee in the sink. I shrugged looking at him, pouted slightly and replied &#34;I really liked it, to be honest&#34;, No I wasn&#39;t lying. His efforts proved out to be the missing sugar of the coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After coming closer, bridging the gap between us, he grasped the mug and placed it on the table. &#34;You don&#39;t really have to drink this&#34;, my back rested at the fridge, his body&#39;s intimacy towards mine passed sensations in my nerves. I, without any doubt got carried away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He, with the tip of his fingers advanced his touch as he gilded them from the back of my fingers till my shoulders. He fixed his hands on my naked shoulders, his thumbs smoothly landed closely towards my collarbones. I gasped, breathing hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When there was no space between our noses, I closed my eyes wanting to feel the moment. I stayed still for a moment, he didn&#39;t kiss me. He pecked me slowly on my forehead. I opened my eyes that very instant and smiled. I couldn&#39;t control but feel. Feel everything, from butterflies to dragons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smirking slightly showing off his dimples, he gave me another peck on my left cheek. My heart raced, my lips hurt from being stretched uncontrollably at his unanticipated actions. He slowly advanced towards my nose and then pecked my chin. &#34;You mean so much to me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do?&#34; I interrogated arching my right brow. A tear rolled through my cheek whilst saying those words. No doubt I had to train them from being so open in front of people, and showcasing me weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t said those words to anyone rather than my mom so of course you do&#34;, he picked me up slowly, bridal style.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curled my hand around his shoulders and rested my head on his chest. This wasn&#39;t an illusion, it was real. No dream could be more beautiful than this. Right after he placed me gently on the bed, he surfaced the blanket on my body. He sat closer to me, our fingers intertwined with each others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t go&#34;, I pulled him close through his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should probably sleep. It&#39;s almost morning&#34;, he gave an assuring smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t go&#34;, I repeated my words. I wanted him to stay with me. We didn&#39;t have forever but it felt like it. He nodded agreeing to my statement. After making space for him, I allowed him to sleep next to me on my bed. He did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, we didn&#39;t cuddle each other. Some amount of his touch and his presence was enough to satiate my heart. I blinked a several times looking deep in his blue eyes. I could feel him breathing, and also could sense the amazing cologne he wore. His slowly closed his eyes, and in a while was deep asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed away a lock of his hair from his forehead to have a closer and deeper view of his alluring face. Within moments, I fell asleep. When I woke up Mr. Reynolds was no where around. I slowly opened my eyes and encountered a huge three layered cake next to the table of my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up instinctively and grasped the note. It read &#34;As promised last night&#34;, I gently folded it and rethought about his statement which was &#39;it would definitely be bigger the following morning&#39;, I didn&#39;t even remember about it. Who was that man becoming and where did he bury the man I knew. Romance was a seven letter word which had no place in his dictionary. I was falling harder, day by day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick blush escaped my lips on thoughts of him. I knew Mr. Reynolds wasn&#39;t a bad man. My heart just needed one proof in his favor so as to trust him again, love him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Happy birthday&#34;, I heard a familiar voice. After tilting my chin up, I saw mom and Samarrah coming towards me slowly. Their hands were full of gifts. I couldn&#39;t control but grin at their unexpected meet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things in my life were getting better day by day. I never heard from James since a long time too. As Samarrah marched towards me, I saw something which definitely demanded explanation. She had a small baby bump which meant she and mom lied to me all the time.</p>
