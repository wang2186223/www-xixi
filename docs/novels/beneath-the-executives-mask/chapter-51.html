                <p>AMANDA&#39;S POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please Mr. Reynolds, my eyes and head are in complete agony &#34;, I turned another page of the sale&#39;s registrar crosschecking the entry on the laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Waters your melodrama seems to multiply after every consequent day since you&#39;ve joined. Maybe you can finish it off as fast as you can because I&#39;m not allowing you to leave the premises before doing the work &#34; he shrugged and continued &#34; I may leave when it&#39;s time for me though &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;The octopus eats itself when stressed, now that&#39;s melodramatic &#39;, my sub-conscience wanted to speak up aloud but didn&#39;t have the courage to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dickhead &#34;, I cussed under my breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard you, doesn&#39;t bother me &#34;, he smirked arching his brow which definitely bothered me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I extended my lips making it look like a smile which wasn&#39;t, to be honest. I fastened up my speed realizing that half of the work was pending yet. In the meanwhile, Mr. Reynolds attended to phone calls traveling across the cabin. All he did was command, blame, and shout at the people on the other side of the phone in high pitched voice. His voice was displeasing to my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck ?&#34;, I heard one of the umpteenth fucks from his side to the person on the other side. He punched the table with all his strength giving it a small crack, I stopped working at once. I sat hushed and forewarned myself about the consequences as I was the teddy he punched when vexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How the fuck did he escape 3 well-trained professionals. I literally warned every single one of you about his fugitive nature. You all are as good as losers. Fuck yourself &#34;, he canceled the phone and threw it on the floor, it broke instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had this intuition. He&#39;ll come after us again, this time it&#39;s gonna be worse for real &#34;, my eyes widened out of trepidation. This news shook me from inside, I stood upright and took steps backward &#34;I need to go hide, he&#39;ll kill me &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was alarmed when Mr. Reynolds caught me tightly intertwining my fingers with his &#34;You don&#39;t know Mr. Reynolds, his smirk was dreadful. &#34;, I pushed him away trying to abscond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chill, take a deep breath. You&#39;re strong, okay ?&#34;, he caressed my baby hair and pushed them behind my ears gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I am not strong, I&#39;m vulnerable. You don&#39;t get it, I failed to save Samarrah, I caused danger to your life, I cause trouble wherever I go &#34;, I face-palmed hiding the tears which were released by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You saved me, you saved your sister. I wish you could&#39;ve saved me &#34;, he paused and pulled me closer releasing my hands from my face while he cupped his hands on my face. &#34;Stay strong, nothing will happen to you because of James, I assure. He&#39;s my enemy, I won&#39;t let him harm you just because you&#39;re acquainted with me &#34;, he reassured keeping his grip over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe in you &#34;, I looked into his dark blue eyes. I pulled myself apart on gaining consciousness about our position. I looked away as I knew that gaining closeness will only result in breaking my fragile heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go home &#34;, he ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m staying. I won&#39;t leave until I complete my work, especially on a sympathy basis. &#34;, I landed my ass on the chair and started where I left off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay, time for me to leave. Lock my cabin and just so you know I&#39;ve cameras here. Better don&#39;t stalk my personal stuff &#34;, he alerted me whilst leaving. I traced his footsteps with my eyes until they were visible and then concentrated on the work again. I completed it within 3 hours after he left, I looked at my wristwatch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God, its 8&#39; o clock already &#34;&#39;, I didn&#39;t realize about the time when engrossed in work. I turned down the switches after arranging the registrars carefully. Within half an hour I was home as there wasn&#39;t much traffic on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I uncurled the scarf from my neck and threw it to the nearest sofa, I was going to be shouted at my lazy behavior but what else does mom&#39;s expect from working women ? &#34;Mom, I&#39;m home &#34;, I screamed my lungs out signaling my mum to get me dinner. I freshened up in mom&#39;s room as it was closer to the kitchen and took a seat on the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom carried a plate in her right hand and accompanied the left with a bottle of water. She sat next to me and served me from the dishes which were on the dining table. &#34;Where&#39;s Sam ?&#34;, I questioned Mom about my younger sister literally for the first time after my kidnap due to my guilt as I was unable to save her sex tape from James, Mr. Reynolds was savage once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s been on a trip with her friend-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Friends? Why did you send her mum being aware of her condition ?&#34;,I objected after swallowing the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She never listens to me, I didn&#39;t want to push her into any restrictions of mine. I just want her to be happy &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she&#39;s making a mess out of her life, you don&#39;t get it &#34;, I stopped eating at once .&#34; Well, did she aborted ?&#34;, I interrogated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She did &#34;, she sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh, I&#39;m such a fool. These all days I had this thought that she was continuing her education and was back to her hostel &#34;, I thumped my legs and marched towards my room as I had enough for today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curled on my bed hugging my thighs with my arms and slept, not that it was a peaceful one but satisfactory enough to end up my tiredness. I looked at the clock which hung on the wall perceiving the fact that I was late for college already. &#34;You&#39;re already late Ammie, you missed out 3 lectures by now. It&#39;s better you rest more &#34;, it was always a struggle between me and me when the question was &#39;waking up&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed the pillow and placed it on my eyes so as to avoid having direct contact with sunlight through the window. I slept again within no seconds. I was alarmed by my alarm clock for the fifth time so I decided to wake up at once. I yanked my bathrobe out of the innumerable unmanageable clothes wearing out from my wardrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled all my hairs back tying them into a ponytail before leaving the house, I wore a long thigh length blue colored plaid skirt and paired it with a white blouse. I complimented my look with mom&#39;s black peep toes, she had less idea that I was wearing it if she&#39;d knew she won&#39;t allow me to. It was an inch bigger than my usual size so it slipped off my toes when in rush so I walked cautiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the bus as a private taxi hired more and I didn&#39;t want to waste any money. I reached the office in around 20 minutes, on closely examining the notifications on my phone I realized that there were 78 missed calls of Gina and Francis combined. &#34; I do apologize for not showing up, come over for dinner ?&#34; ,  I left a text message on the group chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe someplace out, decent and classy as I&#39;m out of Instagram pictures &#34;, DAMN! Francis considered having a social life very mandatory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hiring his personal photographers, as usual, anyways I&#39;m in&#34;, I could feel Gina frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am in too &#34;, I locked my phone and shoved the door as I enrolled myself in the pace of work. I rushed towards the elevator and guided the person towards the seventh floor, I peeped in Mr. Reynolds cabin which was now my daily habit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh hi &#34;, a familiar voice greeted me, I observed the man but failed to recollect where I&#39;ve seen him earlier. I looked at him from head to toe, his outfit was very casual as compared to the office atmosphere. He even had microphones plunged around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused for a while then greeted back at once &#34;hey there, I am sorry I don&#39;t recognize you &#34;, I stretched my lips making it look like a smile. He pushed his hand forward towards me and I shook it gently &#34;Oh my goodness, you&#39;re the guy whose car was savage that day. It literally saved our lives, Thanks dude &#34;, He was the very guy whose car was made a wreck by me, who helped us that day when we had no chances or hopes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dan Attrey at your service madam &#34;, he winked towards me and I grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amanda Waters &#34;, I introduced myself. &#34;Definitely didn&#39;t expect you &#34;, I shrugged &#34;Nice to meet you, Dan, finding familiar faces for the second first time are always pleasant &#34; I kept silent for a while &#34;So, what brought you here &#34;, I was curious</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Reynolds delivered the car just like he promised &#34;, excitement could be sensed in his eyes &#34;So, I came to thank him but in return, he surprised me more &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surprised ?&#34;, I interrogated as he was one of the people who wasn&#39;t complaining about his arrogant nature.</p>
