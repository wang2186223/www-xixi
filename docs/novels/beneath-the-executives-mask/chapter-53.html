                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By applying a pink lip gloss over the same colored matte lipstick I finished my look. Matte was in fashion undoubtedly but I liked it moist. I side braided my hairs leaving the baby hair out and wore a white knee-length one piece that had a huge belt connected to the waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to attend the gathering simply wearing a tank top and pajamas but Gina would&#39;ve frowned. She always taunted me for not getting ready like every bimbo did. I gathered my credit card, some money, and my lip gloss and settled them in my clutch before leaving. I prior-informed mom so I left without giving notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached Renaissance restaurant 30 minutes late from the time we decided upon. I&#39;d already plan an excuse so I walked in stiffly looking around at the classy public, their scent and fashion sense denoted their richness. The restaurant looked expensive, very expensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just hoped that whatever amount of money I carried would suffice my share when payment of the bill . I decided to call Gina so I typed her number as I remembered everyone&#39;s number who was close to me, I hit the call button and canceled it at once when I saw Gina and Francis already seated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not very late I guess &#34;, I did start the flame myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, just 35 minutes. Not very much, we&#39;ve been simply waiting for our crowned queen to arrive. For once can you surprise us with time ?&#39;, Gina frowned. Uh-oh, I did make her mad, very mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haven&#39;t you heard about the term fashionably late ?&#34; , I winked at Francis who sure was enjoying it, he expected me late so he wasn&#39;t really mad at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, fashion implies wearing only lip glosses and choosing braids simply over hair straighteners and blow dryers. You&#39;re absolutely right Amanda &#34;, she pouted looking at my sick fashion but I looked fine I guess, braids are fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you&#39;re hitting at the soft spot. This is the best I could do in such a short time. Don&#39;t I look beautiful Francis ?&#34;, I interrogated looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beautiful enough to get kissed &#34;, he winked. He always had to take things dirty but he lightened the atmosphere whenever tension rolled around. We all laughed in sync hitting Francis on his arms one after the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what do we order ?&#34;, Francis looked over the tablet which was placed on the table, it was one of the classical restaurants which had an electronic ordering system. He looked carefully over each type of food the restaurant possessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want Italian pasta dipped with cheese sauce &#34;, I took possession of the tab</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess I need Chicken lollipops with extra cheese &#34;, Gina took over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Francis pulled the tab from Gina&#39;s hand and ordered his delicacy by himself. He marked over the items and placed the order. Our orders differ but the cheese was in common. &#34;Hi people, so excited to find you&#39;ll hear &#34;, We heard a familiar voice, so we turned around to have a look. It was Samuel, Gina&#39;s guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waved at us all grinning with his yellow teeth. How much effect it had on his good looks, I tried looking away from his teeth as it demanded attention. I looked at Francis who had the same expression as me. We silently laughed being aware of Gina&#39;s emotions towards this guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How does he know, we&#39;re here. Stalker &#34;, I took my seat closer to Francis so that Gina could be close to his guy. I made sure I whispered in Francis&#39;s ears. Gina did figure something from our expression, she knew we wanted it private among us three only.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Francis came close to me, his lips touching my ears &#34;She doesn&#39;t hide anything from him. She&#39;s in love, we can&#39;t blame her. Let&#39;s just adjust &#34;, he murmured in a soft voice and later cleared his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you even order something to drink ?&#34;, I cut off the silence in the atmosphere .&#34;I guess Gina, you should cut Francis&#39;s balls &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gina laughed, her hands intertwined with Samuel. He looked handsome enough, I just wanted to brush his teeth every time. Like I know that there has to be a shade of yellow in everyone&#39;s teeth, it&#39;s natural but it was very yellow. Stop being so judgemental Amms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Francis and I bounded, giving some space to the couple. They say that there&#39;s a wall in friendship whenever the third person arrives but that&#39;s the life you have to accept that and keep going, keep pushing harder for the people you love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly felt a pat on my left arm, Sonia stood there with a sad face. I stood up at once leveling my height with hers, a tear flicked through her eye which traveled across her cheeks making way till the chin. &#34;Hey, it&#39;s okay. What&#39;s wrong ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled her into a hug, she sniffled so Francis handed her a tissue from the box. She took it at once and rubbed a nose with his after pulling over. Francis mouthed me a how-do-you-know-her- but I ignored him focusing on Sonia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I &#34;, she stammered &#34;I had a date, I met him on Facebook, we fixed an appointment. He just didn&#39;t show up &#34;, she seemed low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see his real picture and by real I mean unedited from picsart, retrica or the tiara filter of Snapchat &#34;, she nodded which clearly meant a no. &#34;How did you come for someone who you had no idea about &#34;, I frowned at her childish behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cried more after sensing my angry face .&#34;Oh, I&#39;m sorry &#34;, I covered up. &#34;What&#39;s his name ?&#34;, I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;James Faulkner &#34;, another cheater named James, James Faulkner is an Australian cricket player, he&#39;s definitely fake, damn but wait it was Francis who replied to my question. How did he even know the name of the guy Sonia talked with?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arched my eyebrows towards him in curiosity. &#34; I am your culprit &#34;, he raised both his hands to surrender. My eyes widened in shock, anger, and amusement. How much free time he actually had? Sonia stopped crying at once as she started eyeing Francis and he did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I would be Sonia I would&#39;ve punched his balls for faking out but she went and hugged him instead as he seductively smiled. &#34;Welcome to the family, Sonia &#34;, I faked a smile and welcomed her to our table. After moments, I was left liking everyone&#39;s picture on my Instagram feed while Gina and Francis bonded well with their partners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt alone, not that I wanted a relationship desperately but I craved one too. I believed in fortune, in destiny. I wanted my perfect man to show up when it was a perfect time, I didn&#39;t want it fast. I just wanted it to take things place when they were meant to be, though a bit slow and late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories flashed in my mind, how Mr. Reynolds helped me with my shoes. His touch on my toes yet felt warm and comforting. Stop thinking about him, he&#39;s irrelevant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cornered my eyes and saw that Samuel looked around and placed a short peck on Gina&#39;s lips. Control, you&#39;re public. I looked around the other way and saw Sonia giggling over Francis&#39;s jokes. How about the Dan guy, you confessed about? To be honest, I felt like a third wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey - hey, I am here too &#34;, I frowned and took everyone&#39;s attention. I pouted like a baby and made sure I was in limelight. &#34;I am leaving, I&#39;ll better watch Chuck and Blair romancing &#34;, it wasn&#39;t inferiority complexion but the dinner wasn&#39;t going as I expected it to. Francis initiated a conversation but my mood was already off so I ignored him and focused over the cheese on my food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around towards Francis as he now attended me, Gina was yet attending Samuel. She mouthed me a &#39;sorry&#39; whenever we had eye contact, I know it wasn&#39;t her fault. Samuel was a bit pushy when it came to her, he&#39;d want her to be engrossed only with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God, what the actual fuck &#34;, I looked closer towards the table which was 3 tables away from me, it was Mr. Reynolds. How on earth is he here too? I looked at his companions and realized that he was with the team I confronted in the meeting. He must have definitely obliged their presence by greeting them with dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look at me but continued speaking with his clients, he worked professionally even in personal spaces where people came to relive, burst their stress out. He was so dedicated to working, it scared me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s here &#34;, I shook Sonia&#39;s arm and redirected her vision towards Mr. Reynolds. She had an &#39;&#39;o&#39; formed on her lips which clearly indicated shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Show me, show me, show me the boss baby &#34;, Francis sang out loud, I am glad Mr. Reynolds was tabling away.</p>
