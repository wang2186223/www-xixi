                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move!&#34; I heard the orders again so I even refused to do the breathing requirements aka inhale and exhale. I heard noises which obviously denoted snapping of pictures in all type of directions as I could see the cameraman circling around us. A media company briefly looked towards us and jotted down everything. They were the only ones who were allowed to stay among everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, this picture&#39;s epic &#34;, the camera person showed our picture to the one who was helping us with the positions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He again came towards us and directed a boy to move the chair. Mr. Reynolds kept his hand on my waist and I had to do the sightseeing i.e. look at his alluring face. &#34;Don&#39;t smile, girl&#34;, he warned me which was pretty embarrassing. I was not really good at making aggressive looks but I had to since the cover required passion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect couple &#34;, the photographer looked towards us and a blush escaped through my cheek. I mouthed a &#34;no&#34; and we all ended up laughing except Mr. Reynolds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just end this shoot with some walking. Enlighten the ramp, hot personalities &#34;, the photographer got demanding after every consequent minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both went backward. Mr. Reynolds caught me tightly through my back, I just didn&#39;t understand why. &#34;It&#39;s hurting me &#34;, I tried moving his hand but it was very firm plus hard like a rock and he had this &#39;I don&#39;t care&#39; type of expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We started walking through the ramp very straight and aired up our chin like the proudest kings, Mr. Reynolds&#39;s hand was firm on my back, it just didn&#39;t move from its place. I hated his guts. I hated the way he took advantage of me openly without even thinking about the mindset of other people. Different types of thoughts evolved in my mind like &#39;What if the people think that I satisfy him physically&#39;, &#39;what if they consider me his sex-slave&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew somewhere that there was no answer for my &#39;what if&#39;s&#39;, many questions were unanswerable for example my dad&#39;s name in Mr. Reynolds&#39;s telephone directory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop taking advantage of my body&#34;, I exhaled &#34;and of my silence&#34;, I muttered in a slow voice while walking, clear enough for Mr. Reynolds to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no interest in you and your body&#34;, he replied harshly but refused to remove his hand from my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seems like the exact opposite from your statement &#34;, I brought up the debate. He looked towards me and smirked and then started walking again. We both gave one last pose which was favorable because Mr. Reynolds&#39;s hands were still on my back and I couldn&#39;t shout or create a scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is epic &#34;, the photographer took the last picture and looked towards us with a grin. I exactly knew what he meant, the person from the media looked at us, like a teenage girl looks, with all smiles and curiosity towards a pregnant woman, who isn&#39;t married, and is underage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pack up&#34;, Mr. Reynolds looked around and said in a high-pitched voice. Within 5 minutes everyone moved away from the auditorium. The only people that were present were me and him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop playing the role of a man-whore&#34;, I tried moving his hand away but my strength was lesser than his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me while raising his right brows and said &#34;Oh really&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, actions speak&#34;, I tried adding proverbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that would be the case then my hands would be on your butt or your boobs, don&#39;t you yet get it &#34;, he looked at me with a question mark on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you decided to start with my back&#34;, I was now annoyed &#34;Just let go of your hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine&#34;, he left the grip of his hand from my which made me feel something. I felt lighter. I felt the fresh air-conditioned air traveling through my skin. The dress was worn out of my body. It was more of a wardrobe malfunction. I was annoyed by the fact that Mr. Reynolds saw me half-naked and assured by the fact that Mr. Reynolds was the only person who saw me that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oops &#34;, Mr. Reynolds said with a sigh paired with a smirk and he tried hard to move his eyesight away, away from my skin. I could see him struggling. My face was firing red through my cheeks and my eyeballs were truly focused on the floor out of the excessive amount of shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my Lord&#34; I lifted my dress with my hands and didn&#39;t make any eye contact with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did take great advantage of you&#34; he taunted and started walking away. I could see his sight disappearing from my eyes. I was extremely guilty of ranting on someone who protected my image in front of so many people. I wanted to say sorry but I was too shy to face him after the awkward malfunction. Initially, he saw me in a bra at Pallapora town and now he saw me without it. Life was definitely playing some kind of dirty nude-game with me. I wished that dress came in along with a sleeveless bra.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Reynoooooooolds&#34;, I ran towards him leaving my heels on the floor and catching my dress firmly. He turned around half and stopped walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Th-Thank you so much&#34; I stammered as I was breathing heavily. His face showed that he knew that an apology was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was obvious that I was protecting the reputation of my company so don&#39;t mind&#34;, he turned me around and ran his hands through my naked back. I felt those creatures again in my stomach and I yet refused to accept that they were butterflies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds&#39;s touch on my skin was gentle, his cologne was strong enough for me to wander and get lost in a dream world. He always smelled so good. He tightened up the dress from both of his hand, the grip definitely hurt me, but I decided to stay calm. I later heard a tuck type of noise. I knew that Mr. Reynolds had pinned up the loosened broach again so I let go of my hands from my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around, my eyes focused straight on his eyes. They say eye contact is the most intimidating of all. Well, it was true, it felt better, better than the kiss I shared with James.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always save me &#34;, I so wanted to say these lines but I controlled, I didn&#39;t even utter a single word. This moment felt better in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Amanda you looked so gorgeous today, I mean you do look now too &#34;, James interrupted the moment and pulled me towards him. We were alarmed by his voice, so we looked in every direction except each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, thanks a ton!&#34; I fake smiled as I looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds looked towards us and then walked away after a while. No-one stopped him, I saw him disappearing away from my eyesight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So are you free tonight, after work?&#34; James questioned pulling me closer through my back. Then something clicked me, I remembered everything that I had forgotten about. I knew that I had to pay a visit to his house to do further investigations but I wasn&#39;t ready for having a night-stand with him yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MM- hmm &#34;, I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So dinner or movie &#34;, he re-questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe at your place &#34;, I answered with a smirk and a seductive face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone&#39;s getting naughty! &#34; James pecked me on my forehead. One thing was very sure that I will never sleep with him in any circumstance.</p>
