                <p>How I&#39;m thankful for the life we&#39;ve made &#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time I was the one who led the song, I sang it smiling and then recollected that I missed out a line but since this wasn&#39;t any singing competition it did no harm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;And if we had babies they would have your eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would fall deeper watching you give life.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds took charge over this line which definitely had a certain great impact on me, I really wished upon my future husband to sing this line to me but for this instance, I wanted to kiss him, he looked straight in my eyes but then he was drunk so I couldn&#39;t take advantage over him so I lowered my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You don&#39;t even know how very special you are You leave me breathless&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I completed the song, singing the very last lines. Mr. Reynolds looked at me and then asked, &#34;One more dance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed on his face &#34;No way, you are going to regret this when you come back in your senses tomorrow &#34;, I turned towards him &#34;But you can thank me for the dance eh &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came extremely close to me and removed the pins out of my hairs making them loose and open &#34;You look better now &#34;, he winked at me. It felt like I was living some college camp experience in which Mr. Reynolds played the bad attractive playboy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me in my eyes &#34;What? I am not going to dance anymore &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t ask for a dance though &#34;, He replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what does this look mean which you are giving me right now &#34;, I interrogated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, I&#39;m just gazing over &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;maybe we could gaze at the stars and moon together instead &#34;, I turned his attention away from me because clearly he was attracted to me after having a whole bottle of rum and I was attracted too without even drinking the whole of the bottle so I tried to act against the law of this temporary attraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lied on the ground facing the sky. Mr. Reynolds laid directly next to me, our arms almost touching. We could feel our bodies warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you see that big star there &#34;, he pointed towards the biggest star in the constellation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which one from those thousand ones ?&#34;, I felt confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned my head towards the biggest one which beamed the most &#34; I get it, that one &#34;, I had less idea about the star he was talking about but I reacted that I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Waters, have you heard about one famous saying?&#34; he questioned</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead&#34;, I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That could be my mom. The one whose beaming the most, she may be smiling at me from the other side. Do you believe in this myth that people become stars when they die? &#34;, I could now look at the emotional side of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do, Mr. Reynolds. Our loved ones follow us wherever we go because they care for us even from the other side but there&#39;s no one who is alone in this entire world. God always makes sure to bless us with someone&#39;s presence when you feel the other one&#39;s absence &#34;, I tried consoling him whilst catching his hand tightly. I could feel him crying but he didn&#39;t actually shed any tear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rubbed my hand which was intertwined with his &#34;You are an amazing woman Miss Waters, I hope&#34; he paused &#34;oh look there&#39;s a shooting star&#34;, he cut his sentence and changed the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s make a wish then&#34;, I didn&#39;t redirect him to the topic again and closed my eyes to make a wish. I cornered my eyes to see what he was doing, he looked towards the sky very passionately. He caught me inquiring on him so I closed my eyes instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Lord! please help Mr. Reynolds to unwrap the knot he has been tied in with life, guide him to the perfect path and make his life less complicated &#34;, I looked upon the shooting star &#34; Oh and yes guide us home safely too &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you wish?&#34;, I interrogated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wished that &#34;, he came close to me and directed his lips towards my ears &#34;That.....&#34; he paused &#34;I will not tell you, It&#39;s a secret &#34;, he started to laugh ceaselessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, this is so funny. I actually forgot to laugh, HA HA HA &#34;, I mimicked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He regained his original lying position and replied &#34;we aren&#39;t supposed to tell our wishes, it&#39;s between us and the creator &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh that&#39;s what a student from third grade believes in &#34;, I tried not to be rude but then I was alarmed by the fact that I was acting like him. &#34;So tell me the best moment of your life &#34;, I covered up for my rude behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sided up towards me resting his body on the right side &#34;It was basically when I was 10 and we all went on a family trip to Paris, My elder brother Ryan helped me overcome all my phobias. We did paragliding, scuba diving and etc but then &#34;, he paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind was blown by the fact that Mr. Reynolds was not the only child. &#34;Then, what? &#34; I questioned out of curiosity.</p>
