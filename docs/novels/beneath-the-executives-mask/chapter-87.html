                <p>Why would he hide his belongings, this whole freaking mansion belonged to him. I tried opening his wardrobe but it was locked, I paved my way towards the drawer. Siding away the unnecessary stuff, I came across a picture. It was more of a family picture but it didn&#39;t have his father. It was just his mother and his elder brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes settled on the picture, they refused to look in other direction, this picture was clicked maybe when he was in his early 10&#39;s. He grinned and so did everyone in it. Selena Gomez and Charlie Puth don&#39;t talk anymore and Mr Reynolds didn&#39;t smile anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept the picture as it previously was, in the drawer and opened the lower drawer but to my discontent I didn&#39;t find anything useful there too. Whatever I had to do, it had to be quick. I didn&#39;t want to showcase myself as some creep who stalks his stuff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In order to go through his wardrobe, I had to have access which could be only possible through the keys which I didn&#39;t have. Before leaving the room, I made sure that all his stuff was as neat as before. He was one of the men who kept their belongings neat, clean and in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After exiting the room, I searched for the store room, it was definitely not on the same floor. Maybe it was on the ground floor. I descended the stairs, &#34;Hey, can you guide me till the store room?&#34; I questioned the maid who was cleaning the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not allowed to go there ma&#39;am&#34;, she warned me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you saying me a no? You don&#39;t really know who I am, do you?&#34;, I tried threatening her .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you ma&#39;am?&#34; she questioned genuinely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shouldn&#39;t concern you, guide me &#34;, she shook her head and took the lead. She walked silently and I followed, it was situated on the first floor of this mansion. &#34;Thank you &#34;, I genuinely smiled &#34;By the way, What&#39;s your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call me Kayla, Anything I can help with?&#34; she questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded ,&#34; carry on whatever you&#39;re doing, I&#39;ll call for help if I require, thank you once again &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her walk away and then marched in the room. It was quite dusty like it hadn&#39;t been cleaned for years. After patting on some rusted stuff, I only got access to some shitty bed sheets, old dresses, stoves etc. To my melancholy, I couldn&#39;t encounter anything helpful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then suddenly, my hand hit something. On deeper observation I realized that it was a family album. I quickly opened it and was perplexed after looking at the pictures. It was full of pictures, precisely of my parents holidaying with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only question which arose in my mind was that when I asked mom about it she said that she wasn&#39;t aware of his family much. Was mom lying? I needed answer to my questions, I just had no one to give that to me. I turned the pages of the album, the pictures were very jolly, everyone in it seemed quite happy then what exactly went wrong that Mrs Reynolds had to give up on her life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A part of me was convinced that it was somehow connected to my family. This only would&#39;ve be his reason to come after my dad&#39;s family which was me and my sister. He definitely did wrong to us, if only I knew then I&#39;d hate him a little less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, are you done or shall I wait out?&#34;, I dropped the album on suddenly hearing a familiar voice. I knew who it was from, I had no guts to look straight. I was caught red-handed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-uh &#34;, I swallowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came closer to me, I took backwards steps with every forward step of his. &#34;Whatever you were doing make sure you don&#39;t have to do it again &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gathered my courage, &#34;I need answers&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now is not the time &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then when is it? If you&#39;re not going to answer me then eventually I have to find out myself&#34;, I picked up the album and turned the pages from right where I stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you&#34;, he yanked the album away and threw it in the air. He grabbed me through my wrists and pulled me till the elevator. I tried punching him several times but I failed every time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You give me reasons to hate you&#34;, I screamed on top of my lungs as he pushed me on the bed and locked the door from outside. I tried banging several times but no one heard me or at least they pretended that they couldn&#39;t hear me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open the fucking door&#34;, I yelled but failed to get any response. On failing continuously, I glided my back on the door and settled my ass on the floor, My head rested on the door, I didn&#39;t take possession of my phone, just rested there for a while and closed my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without realizing upon the time, I kept my position constant. Hunger didn&#39;t strike me nor did anyone show up. My head made up stories, negative and the positive ones. Did everyone team up and kill his mother, if this was the case then why was he hiding it. Why doesn&#39;t he just cage every culprit behind the bars, where they deserve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know that whether I could digest the fact of mom being the culprit. No, Amanda don&#39;t you doubt on your mom. She&#39;s a good woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hearing, a small bang on the door, I straightened myself up , watched the time as it was quite late, precisely 12 am, opened the door slowly. To my surprise, Francis, Gina, Sonia and Dan popped in with a huge cake in their hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday dear Amanda, Happy birthday to you &#34;, they all sang in synchronisation. Sonia released the snow-spray in the air and Dan blew whistles whilst circling his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped, my eyes sweated. How did I forget my birthday. &#34;Thank you so much&#34;, I thanked them warmly with the bottom of my heart.</p>
