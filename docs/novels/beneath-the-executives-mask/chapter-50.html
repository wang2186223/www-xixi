                <p>&#34;I um can you guide me with my work. I feel lost &#34;, I framed my sentence as I felt lost for words. &#39;What&#39;s wrong with me&#39;, I whispered under my breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As much I remember Miss Waters, you never had a memory loss &#34;, he arched his right eyebrow but didn&#39;t divert his attention from the laptop. The flash on the screen reflected his dark blue eyes making them shinier. &#39;Stop noticing him Amms&#39;, my mind was redirected towards shitty stuff a lot today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;sorry &#34;, I apologized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Another fake apology &#34;, he sarcastically remarked. I literally saved his wealth to which I never got appreciated for once, no matter he saved me in exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s deem to forget everything which we went through &#34;, his eyes now met with mine. His jaws clenched with his hands as he rested his elbows on the table. &#34;Our kiss and everything meant nothing to me and should not mean anything to you too. It was a necessity for the moment &#34;, he yet looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not that I consider it something Mr. Reynolds &#34;, I lied as it did mean something, my voice turned heavy but I controlled and kept it normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good for you ! &#34;, he smirked examining my dress and then towards my face again &#34; Here is the pen drive which has your sister&#39;s short video &#34;, he lifted his hand which held the pen drive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks &#34;, I took it from his hands and kept it inside the pocket of my jeans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every video which was possessed in James&#39;s electronic appliances has been deleted by my technical team. I wanted you to keep the last piece with you so I handed you over. You helped me with my problem so I returned the favor. We&#39;re 1:1 now &#34;, his straight face was constant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks again &#34;, I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not interested &#34;, he turned the pages of the file he held. &#34;I want you to separate the purchase and sale registers as per the years and cross-check the entries in the books of accounts. I don&#39;t trust the auditors so I want you to complete the work yourself. Pay special attention from the day you went missing &#34;, oh hi Mr. Reynolds it was &#39;we&#39; but he definitely didn&#39;t want to sound weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried placing the files on one upon the other to make a heap so that I could carry them freely to my cabin.I carried them aloft but then ended up collapsing them on the ground, not that it was due to my clumsy nature but the weight was too much for me to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you do one work in a proper manner &#34;, he vexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am so sorry, didn&#39;t mean too &#34;, one of my umpteenth apologies for the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay here, do the work right here. You&#39;re urging to go to your cabin because you want to waste your time there. Do the work here in front of my eyes .&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t, I&#39;ll be more comfortable in my territory &#34;, I objected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do as I say.&#34;, he ordered in his bossy tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine &#34;, I thumped my legs and sat on the chair which confronted his, the only hurdle between us was the table. I placed the files on the table haphazardly as I wanted to annoy him so that he&#39;d send me in my cabin himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence caressed the atmosphere except for the sound generated by the flipping of the file&#39;s pages. &#34;I need tea &#34;, I craved for it. I was more of a tea person and always chose tea over coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a babysitter Miss Waters, you can get yourself one. Get me an Espresso on your way back from the canteen &#34;, he demanded knowing the fact that he could&#39;ve simply placed a call to the peon who&#39;d get him that but he simply wanted to exasperate me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will sir, are you diabetic ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the fuck did this question arise from ?&#34;, he questioned back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just so I don&#39;t add much sugar in your esssspressso &#34;, I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t prefer sugar. Tell them who&#39;s it for and they&#39;ll make it my way &#34;, he sounded arrogant and rude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left the cabin at once as the silence was getting on my nerves. &#34;Hey Amanda what&#39;s up. Long time no see &#34;, a fair girl came towards me grinning. I did encounter her before but failed to recollect her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Sweetheart, I never ran into someone so familiar before. At our last meet I forgot to take your number. Can I have it now ?, Tell me your perfect spelling &#34;, I learned this trick from Francis as he always forgot the names of girls because they were in excess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sonia Josephs &#34;, she spelled her name whilst taking a pause after every letter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So good to see you again Sonia &#34;, I hugged her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I reciprocate the feelings &#34;, she hugged me back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went towards the counter and placed my order for one classical tea and Mr. Reynolds&#39;s espresso specifying his name. I took a sip as it refreshed my mind and then carried the tray in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll bid you farewell since I have a break and plenty amount of time to waste &#34;, Sonia never failed to smile. Her smile was so encouraging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;ll be amazing &#34;, I winked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does he corresponds in the same way now because it been a record that someone has stayed this long with him. 1.5 months is quite amazing. Very impressive eh &#34;, she looked puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;of which, almost 17 days I was in exile &#34;, I muttered in my breadth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Did you say something ? she interrogated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing at all &#34;, I answered giving a fake smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll see you around then &#34;, she waved off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;willing to &#34;, I replied back instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth formed an &#39;o&#39; out of shock, all the stuff which I held in my hands loosened its grip and as a result, it fell on the tiles over the floor. The espresso&#39;s cup broke into pieces as it littered across the floor and my tea mixed with it. James stood there in rugged jeans shirtless which showed of his wounded torso.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three of Mr. Reynolds&#39;s man completely dressed up in a suit caught him as his hands were handcuffed. His wounds were visible from afar and I knew well that these were the consequences for betraying Mr. Reynolds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They threw him in front of Mr. Reynolds through their legs by kicking him on his ass. James&#39; eyes showed pain but it didn&#39;t show guilt, not even a percent. His eyes met mine as he turned around, cold shivers ran through my spine that moment resulting in goosebumps and I looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry brother &#34;, James hugged Mr. Reynolds&#39; legs, he kicked him on his chest with all his might.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a back step out of fear. My lips parted but I couldn&#39;t speak, I stood in one corner as quiet as I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The apology period ended long back, I did try to negotiate &#34;&#39;, his face was fuming red out of anger &#34;Time for some action &#34;, he kicked him continuously and ruthlessly. I caught my ears avoiding the painful noises which were James&#39; reaction to his punishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James tried to crawl whilst taking support from his knees, Mr. Reynolds dragged him upright from his collar making him stand face to face with him. &#34;Douchebag &#34;, he cussed out loudly and punched him on his nose which instinctively resulted in bleeding. He kicked him on his stomach with his pointed shoes, he shrieked in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds ruthlessly pinched him towards the wall grabbed his chin so that he looked straight in his eyes &#34;I share no mercy with the people who go against me or try to deceit me. You get no last chances. You were one of the people to whom I was affectionate, we matched no blood but I always considered you my brother. I am glad I&#39;m all to myself now &#34;, his face was cold and dark threatening every bone in my body, though he wasn&#39;t after me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s the gun sir &#34;, one of the men threw it towards Mr. Reynolds, he caught it with his left hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He threw the gun again towards the men back after thinking for a moment&#34; I don&#39;t want to get into legal matters. Take him to the same forest and make sure he dies a slow painful death &#34;, his eyes were cold and lacked humanity in all senses .&#34;Oh no wait &#34;, he signaled the men to stop. He came towards me and pulled me closer violently by my left forearm</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t do this Mr. Reynolds &#34;, I tried to get away from the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Miss Waters, he&#39;s your backstabber too &#34;, he pushed me at a point where I was very close with James, he laid on the floor in pain all shredded with wounds exposed to blood. He crawled towards me and tried hugging my legs asking for forgiveness, I hopped out panicking. I side hugged Mr. Reynolds closing my eyes whilst resting my face in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just take him away &#34;, I kept my eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kill him and make it look like a suicide &#34;, he directed the men and ordered them to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly opened my eyes staying in the same position, I caught a small gaze of James. When our eyes met, he smirked at me. It not only looked evil but also devilish, no better synonym could describe his facial expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened out of shock, my lips failed to purse as I swallowed in fear. &#34;Take this &#34;, Mr. Reynolds handed me a bottle of mineral water as he seated me on the chair. I gulped a sip and closed the cap and kept it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The negative memories rushed again, maybe Mr. Reynolds could&#39;ve killed him right away. What if he returned? , I looked at the shitload of work and tried paving out all the negative thoughts which flooded like a tsunami in my mind.</p>
