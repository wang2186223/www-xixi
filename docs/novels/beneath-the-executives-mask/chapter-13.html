                <p>JASON WATERS 0921-4662728228</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name was clear enough for me to figure out that it was my father&#39;s. This number has been my password ever since. Though I was mad at him for leaving my mother I did love him. But the question which appeared in my mind was that how was his number in Mr. Reynolds&#39;s telephone directory? , with a red mark?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mommy was a brave and intelligent woman. She had been through a lot in her life as life had never been very fair to her. She&#39;d been challenged at every stage in her life since my sister and I took birth. She never really got the love she deserved from her life partner i.e. my father who never looked at her like all women wanted to be looked at by a man. Despite this, she carried a smile on her face which constantly enlightened the house in her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father?, I don&#39;t blame him, as everyone has a basic right to choose upon their life partner in this modern world. He calls me up once in a while which is basically on my birthday. I&#39;m not very &#39;connected&#39; or acquainted with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s one thing about him which turned me off in my thoughts, he left us all when I was 10 years old... He never looked back ever since, never inquired about mom&#39;s well-being, never supported us financially or emotionally despite having a handsome amount of wealth and time. It made me think that maybe my sister and I were some sorts of mistakes resulted from unprotected sex. But then we had a mom who was a huge blessing in our lives and who as well covered up for dad&#39;s part too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no guts to face Mr. Reynolds and ask him any question regarding this so it was going to be an unfolded mystery. Just mere coincidence, I tried diverting my mind but &#34;what&#39;s up with the red mark&#34;, said the inner conflicting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I neglected the fact and continued doing the chores. I finished in a while. I checked the contacts. I carefully turned the phone off and then went to sleep with mixed thoughts and views.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was doodling my signature on the last page of my history book. Well, it was the only thing that felt right to me because the history professor was a pure definition of &#34;boredom&#34;. I sometimes wondered how in the world the fights which happened during the world wars were relevant to our day to day life. Like, I&#39;m not going to throw a nuclear bomb at some other country. History was a complete piece of shit as according to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then finally the bell rang and the lecture winded up. I hooked up with my best friends in our favorite place, the canteen, of course. Well, everything was good about this place. We could pour our hearts out to one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You all wouldn&#39;t really believe what happened between me and Samuel last night &#34;, Gina took a short sip of her coke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Says the virgin Mary&#34;, Francis stretched out the word virgin-a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, did you lose it with him?&#34; I questioned startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amanda &#34;, Gina blushed stretching out the last word in my sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, did you?&#34; I questioned again, &#34;And why the fuck, I don&#39;t have any idea regarding this topic?&#34; I re-questioned again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It just happened Ammie, with the spur of the moment, we didn&#39;t plan on it&#34;, she side hugged me, &#34;And I wanted to say this to you in person. I love you, you know right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fake smiled as I was yet mad on her. &#34;Treats on me &#34;, Francis broke the short term silence.&#34;Speaks the millionaire&#34;, I sarcastically remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is the hot boss? I saw his picture on the front page of the local newspaper and I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off him&#34;, Gina almost drooled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Says the taken girl&#34;, Francis teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gina punched him slightly on his face and whispered &#34;Our deep little secret&#34;, We both nodded like fools and then Francis started observing me for a while and then questioned, &#34;Why are you not leaving his office when he is so annoying, I will talk to my father about your new job and trust me this is no kind of favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clause No 1 - In only the case of death, a contractee is detached from his/her duty&#34;, I made an air quotation and said with a melodious tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell, there may be some other way out&#34;, Gina interrogated, her brows furrowed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clause No 2 - Only on the permission of the contractor&#34;, I sighed and then continued &#34;That&#39;s never going to happen&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, make it happen &#34;, Francis sounded evil whilst grinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is no Maybelline tag line France&#34;, I knew that there was no way out of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you could force him to do it, annoy him to an extent so that he has no other choice&#34;, Francis started spilling out the beans of his evil plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And France how can she annoy him&#34;, Gina interrupted, her expressions showed her level of curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me explain that, you recently turned impure girl, don&#39;t try to break my focus &#34;, Gina was frowning at his punch line but France didn&#39;t care and continued &#34;So Ammie, what annoys him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of them started looking at me and I just said one word which summed up everything. That word was E-M-O-T-I-O-N-S</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Mr. evil France, when he doesn&#39;t have any emotions, how can she play with it, by seducing him?&#34; Gina had a &#39;whatever&#39; expression and Francis&#39;s eyes widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a plan, Miss impure&#34;, Francis looked at Gina and then at me with an evil grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wha-at, I&#39;m not doing that, what do you consider me, a local prostitute?&#34; I raised my eyebrows totally dissatisfied with his plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then stay with the dictator and get tortured every fucking second&#39;, Francis pouted, he seemed irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t really intend to carry forward the plan but I could not deny the fact that he actually had a point.&#34;Why not, come on, it&#39;s like an adventure. You could take your revenge and plus you&#39;ll be bailed out of Reynolds&#39;s jail&#34;, Gina sounded like a complete bitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head &#34;I don&#39;t want to play with someone&#39;s emotions&#34;, I sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re seducing him so much that he gets annoyed and removes you from your position. It&#39;s simple, don&#39;t complicate it now &#34;, Francis grabbed the extra fries from my hand and stuffed it in his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-but I-I don&#39;t know how to s-seduce him or anyone&#34;, I stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like, I seduce every stranger who walks beside me&#34;, Gina offended sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally the impure one does justice to her new nickname &#34;, Francis winked and Gina grabbed all the fries from his hand and emptied the plate on his head. Francis frowned and threw the leftover chips the same way, in the offence. I parted myself from our threesome and when people were looking at their fight. I made the I-don&#39;t-know-them expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, they both settled up, I gathered my belongings and unseated myself. &#34;I&#39;ll keep you updated with the seductive tips&#34;, Francis smirked, an evil grin surrounded his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too&#34;, Gina lined up her statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed and left. I reached my destination before time, so I decided to sit in the lobby. I intended to make friends as the only person I was familiar here with were Mr. Reynolds, James aka man-flirt-whore, and the receptionist whom I regularly gave attendance regarding arrival and departure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes encountered a girl somewhere between the stairs and the canteen. She stood there still in a stiff position, so I decided to attack her for the friendship zone. She was wearing some sort of old fashioned skirt paired with a blouse. The nerds complimented her cute face. She just needed some grooming to look exotic..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi there &#34;, I went towards her and gestured for a shake with my right hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook it at once and replied &#34;Hey, sorry I don&#39;t know you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me neither, I&#39;m Amanda Waters&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sonia Josephs, nice meeting you Amanda, she smiled looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mutual feelings&#34;, I smiled back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what kind of work do you do here &#34;, I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in the marketing department. Maintaining the books of accounts is basically my job&#34;, she furrowed her brows which definitely meant that it was my turn to answer her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m the personal secretary of Mr. Reynolds&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? Take care!&#34; she smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is that even shocking?, like I know he&#39;s one sort of a monster&#34;, I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just paired your answer with the question &#34;, she laughed back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll see you soon then&#34;, I waved her goodbye, to which she reciprocated the same cheerfully. I looked at my watch and I knew that now was the time to hop in my cabin and start working my ass off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly checked my phone and I could see France&#39;s and Gina&#39;s messages wishing me good luck with my new mission. I was not ready yet but then I thought that what&#39;s wrong with it. I just had to annoy him, because a man like Aaron Reynolds could never fall for me, so it was only a win-win situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>FRANCIS - Smile to whatever he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>GINA - don&#39;t even think about arguing, okay?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone was popping up to innumerable messages. I knew that this plan could have consequences, either a good one or a bad one. My friends were throwing me into a pool in which I didn&#39;t know swimming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I come in sir?&#34; I knocked at the door and peeped a bit. Mr. Reynolds was busy having coffee. After looking at him, I always wondered that why can&#39;t a guy like such, who is completely blessed with looks and money, date someone. He could literally buy the prettiest girl on this planet. Maybe he was missing out on a big part of his life, like which guy doesn&#39;t want love in his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure Miss Waters, it&#39;s your father&#39;s office. You can come in whenever you want to&#34;, every word was decorated with sarcasm. He literally breathed sarcasm.</p>
