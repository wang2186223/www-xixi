                <p>&#34;No! No, he&#39;s not a gay &#34;, he chortled and continued, &#34;It&#39;s just that he doesn&#39;t like a woman&#39;s company unless it is on his bed. So, I was wondering why Aaron chose you &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have an answer to this question but I guess we have some history&#34;, I told him the whole story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s too small for a matter to affect Aaron, I feel, but since you&#39;re unaware too let&#39;s not talk about it, and by the way, nice meeting you Amanda &#34;, James was trying to be formal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice meeting you too James &#34;, I acted formally too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aaron has some work with you. Attend him in a while but make it quick&#34;, he finally told me the actual purpose he was here for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, definitely&#34;, I stood up and shook his hands which basically office people do when they wave goodbye. I saw it in the movies. Well, it was really a realistic gesture and was a must, I then realized. It wasn&#39;t the only thing I realized at that moment. The other thing which knocked down my mind was that James was saying the lines Francis told me earlier. If Mr. Reynolds had a purpose to admit me here, then I had to find out what sort of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On completing the last portion of work, I paved my way towards the Devil&#39;s cabin, and this time I was prepared for everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to do even the ugliest of his works with a smile okay?&#34; I rhetorically questioned myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I come in sir?&#34;, I asked Mr. Reynolds permission for getting in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, Miss Waters &#34;, he looked quite cheerful and he had a big trophy on his table so I now knew the real reason behind his happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got this yesterday, I invited some guests from the television network (media) to forecast this on the television so I want you to take care of those guests properly because even the slightest mistake can ruin the reputation and it is supposed to be a social media stunt for raising the reputation of my company. Be careful&#34;, He finally exhaled after leaving all the words out of his lips. Well, I don&#39;t want to say this but his blue eyes were so mesmerizing. I had to really keep my hormones sane as the view I beheld of his beautiful face was something I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His black suit fitted his body perfectly. His defined jaw was surfaced by subtle beards making his look sexier. His straight nose was carved artistically on his ethereal face. I or any other girl who was attracted in men couldn&#39;t stop making cute illusions in her mind after encountering such a human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Focus Amanda, he hates you and you hate him back, I tried regaining my attention while talking to myself but his face and body was really distracting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds emptied the jar of water in a glass and came towards me holding the same in his right hand, and suddenly, I heard a clash. The glass united with the floor and the water surfaced it along with small pieces of the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did that on purpose right?&#34; I interrogated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a mere representation of you from the past who wanted to seek attention &#34;, he was annoyed by my yesterday&#39;s mistake and I don&#39;t really blame him because it was me who was at fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I apologize for the mistake but it was a genuine one, I swear &#34;, I said with all the innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell a 4-year kid about it and he will believe. I gave the waitress&#39;s costume to you and you tried spoiling my party, fair enough. You are really not as innocent as you look Miss Waters&#34;, He raised his eyebrows and then continued &#34;You are cunning and intelligent&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cannot tell me or blame me for things I didn&#39;t do Sir&#34;, I frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re running short of time Miss Waters. Grab a mop and clean this shit. I don&#39;t want my guests to encounter such a mess&#34;, he pointed towards the mop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew it was my fault so without uttering a word and with a genuine smile, I took the mop and started cleaning the mess. It felt like I was his personal maid. I couldn&#39;t really object to it since I signed the contract papers already. Through hell or back, I had to stick to this job, with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when I almost completed, I looked at him and replied: &#34;Done&#34;. Whilst looking at the floor, small droplets of blood caught my attention. I now knew how the glass shattered into pieces. I, let my gaze travel till his hands. There was a deep cut on his right palm which bled continuously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So instead, I went towards his table and removed some tissues from the box, grabbed his hand, and placed the tissues tightly over the bleeding area so as to stop the continuously flooding blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing Miss Waters?&#34; he tried pulling his hand away but I had a tight grip over it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clearing the mess so accordingly I&#39;m listening to your orders.&#34; the blood almost stopped. I opened his desk&#39;s drawer and took possession over the first aid box. I quickly removed the antiseptic cream and applied it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really hated this guy but also I could not see him in pain. He saved me yesterday and today, I returned the favor. Though, it was very less comparatively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to push you out of my cabin&#34;, he said angrily, he yanked away from his hands away from my hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After the guests leave&#34;, I took the nearest chair to settle my ass on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hopefully, the meeting with the guests was not really long and it didn&#39;t include any of my clumsy behavior. After the guests left, I paved my way towards my cabin.</p>
