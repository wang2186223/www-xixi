                <p>Gavin looked at the seats where the other ministers used to sit and seethed. In their places were elevated commoners and warriors as courtiers along with all the pack leaders, the alphas, and lunas. He sat across the table from Basil, but he never felt so alone or powerless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph had been cruel in the way he&#39;d allowed his ceremonial title to remain, a cold gleam in his eye every time he glanced at Gavin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would pay for this but Gavin held his tongue as people began to speak about their options.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annexing the territory of the vampire queen was partially in their interest. More land typically meant more power, but the land had been barren since time immemorial. If the land was truly barren, then annexing the land would just bring more mouths to feed. After all the upheaval, they wouldn&#39;t have the food stores to make it through the year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph watched Gavin contemplating it. His thoughts were clear on his face, and to a degree, Adolph agreed, but there was no way around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think the time to discuss do or do not has passed,&#34; Raven said calmly, her eyes glinting with moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph nodded. Some part of him had expected her to say as much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree. If I ignore the lands of the vampire nation, it will only breed another place where trouble and resentment can brew; however, with taking over that land and the people there, human, vampire, and werewolf several laws will need to be changed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the table seemed to be thinking of one law or another, but he had a feeling only a handful of people at the table were thinking about the laws about slaves. He would have to adopt penalties about forced feeding on humans and harassment of human towns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of this, of course, would have been easier if he had an understanding of vampire culture and laws as they were before if there ever had been laws beyond Morrigan&#39;s decrees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am less worried about the changes in law as I am about the vampires who are still at large. I have already ordered the border patrol to expand towards the cliffs weekly. I&#39;ll be sending officials to take a census of the areas that we are taking over to track people officially human, vampire, and werewolf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are truly entering a new age&#34; A general said gravely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before the borders have been stabilized, I want laws in place to support the changes that will come including the full abolition of the slave trade, no matter the species, sanctioned trade routes, and incentives to encourage harmony between the races.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed. It was a taller order to fill, but not impossible. Eden had a plan. He could lean on what his attempt left behind and build upon it, tweaking it until it sat right with his style of ruling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There should be limitations of how humans are turned into vampires,&#34; a former soldier said. &#34;Intel said it was done almost indiscriminately and mentioned a blood tax.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, &#34;For protection. That will be outlawed in the same way that werewolf harassment of human villages is prohibited.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation carried on with a page taking notes at his side about the social issues before they moved on to the military issues. More land meant more land to protect and a need to increase the military&#39;s size. It would be a headache, but they could get it done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There will be some restrictions for the first few years regarding social mobility,&#34; Adolph said, agreeing with Dorian. &#34;But no more than five years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin clenched his jaw, &#34;There is too much hatred and resentment for five years to be enough. The vampires lost the war, they should be subjugated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...I think five years might be too long.&#34; Gavin lifted his head startled by Basil&#39;s voice. The entire room looked at Basil and he looked startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph gave him a small smile, hoping it was encouraging, &#34;Go on, Basil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat, trying to ease his nervousness. Once, he and Laura had spoken about the debtor laws and restructuring them. His father had already made the changes, but when debt holders were allowed to pull their debtors into basic indentured servitude, the term was fifteen years and included the entire family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She argued that fifteen years was ridiculous depending on the size of the debt and would make people prone to leave the kingdom rather than pay it back. He&#39;d been furious that she wouldn&#39;t agree that it wasn&#39;t the debt-holders right to hold them for that long, but had been embarrassed to find out later that the number of people leaving the werewolf kingdom who had been roped into that law was high ever since the ministers put it into effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It only benefits the debt-holder to have free labor for fifteen years with no oversight about how much the debtor owed* *It would be better to encourage and support the debtor to get current with a shorter term and stay current.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura was always seeing the larger picture and trying to make him into a better person, but he just didn&#39;t listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it&#39;s true that they were already oppressed, adding another five years to their current state will only make them more resentful. We should encourage their loyalty to the throne and support them in acclimating to the new era.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph smiled looking at Basil. His eyes were haunted a bit, but his voice was calm and confident. He wondered if Basil had thought of it himself or was staring through his memories at some argument that he and Laura had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we make it five years, I think there should be some sort of limitations or guidelines about whose movements are restricted. Age limits or positions in society.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That would take too long,&#34; Gavin growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe,&#34; Basil conceded and met his father&#39;s gaze. &#34;But it will take longer to fight another war if we push them too far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin stared wide-eyed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have an excellent point,&#34; Adolph said. &#34;I plan to open positions in the military to vampire and human citizens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A general winced, &#34;Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, &#34;Not immediately, of course, at least not for everyone. Not at least for the next year until we can get a better idea of the populace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Basil, &#34;I think a year is enough time to get a sense of their sentiment and encourage their loyalty to the throne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil flushed, beaming with pride as Raven smiled knowingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s also a matter I want looked into,&#34; Adolph said, &#34;Anyone with magical ability in the area.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven frowned, &#34;Wiccans?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eden was a Wiccan though he was also half-vampire,&#34; Adolph sighed. &#34;He was quite proficient in his craft. Laurel has posed the question of where he learned such magic if Wiccans are extinct as we believe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there was some community of Wiccans out there, they would be the best bet to figure out how to dispose of Eden&#39;s body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, Chasel was interviewing Laurel today about what she had learned and they were still interviewing the people that had been captured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They adjourned for lunch and Adolph clapped Basil on the shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did well, son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil gave him a trembling smile before nodding and allowing Adolph to cajole him towards lunch in the military&#39;s mess hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel parted from Chasel a little before lunch as her stomach grumbled. Chasel chuckled as he escorted her to the dining parlor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m told that the ladies of the castle will be taking lunch here today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, &#34;Thanks, Chasel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She entered as a peal of laughter went through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who knew he had it in him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is hope for our little nephew yet!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel tilted her head at Raven&#39;s gleeful words, &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basil disagreed with his grandfather during the meeting,&#34; Raven said proudly. &#34;With quite a though out point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe all the alcohol is making him smarter,&#34; Irene snarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven swatted her shoulder, &#34;Be nice, Irene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged, &#34;He&#39;s not here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel took a seat laughing and listening as lunch was served. Delia was absent. She guessed she was having lunch under Lady Helena&#39;s tutelage today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent of the food made Laurel&#39;s stomach almost roar. She was so hungry she barely waited for her plate to be set in front of her before tearing into the steak and moaning at how good it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven watched her, shocked as Laurel ate with perfect grace and such speed that drew suspicion. She looked at Irene who seemed to be having the same thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel, sweetheart how long have you had such an appetite?&#34; Raven asked. &#34;You eat like you&#39;re eating for *two.* &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel looked up and froze, her eyes widened and her gaze dropped to her lap for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irene chuckled, &#34;Hmm Sounds like a trip to the doctor is in order.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A murmur went around the room of shocked amusement and excitement. Laurel stood and shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I don&#39;t think-&#34; Her stomach growled again and she flushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think your stomach disagrees dear,&#34; Raven said gamely and nodded to her seat. &#34;At least finish the steak, hm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel sunk and ate a bit more slowly, contemplating the possibility. The thought filled her with warmth and a bit of fear. She and Adolph had only just been married. Were they ready for a child?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After lunch, they went to the doctor. Laurel let the woman poke and prod her a bit anxiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re pregnant,&#34; she said flatly. &#34;Not much of a show-er, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel wasn&#39;t sure if the sound that came from her was a scream or a squeal, but she knew it was ecstatic.</p>
