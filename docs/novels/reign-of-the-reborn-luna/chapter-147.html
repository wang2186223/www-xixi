                <p>*Laurel?* *Where are you?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel looked up as Adolph&#39;s words came to her mind. She followed Delia through the garden away from the lights of the ballroom and into the night. The moon was full above them as they walked.  &#34;So, what is that you wanted to speak to me about?&#34; Laurel asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;m outside with Delia.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#34; Delia blew out a pained breath as they walked. &#34;It&#39;s going to sound really insincere, considering everything, but&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They came to an outcropping of rock. She could barely make out the sounds of the party in the distance. The scent of wine and the wind made her shudder. Had it been so long since she was waking up screaming in terror from the memory of being pushed to her death. She looked up at the moon and felt the memory surfacing just a little, but pushed it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;m coming to get you.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to say I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry for-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice growled, *Move!*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel turned around just as Delia lunged for her and shoved her back. Her feet slipped, but she leaned forward, avoiding falling over the edge. Delia bared her teeth, her eyes glinting red with rogue light and Laurel&#39;s heart clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just couldn&#39;t make it easy could you?&#34; Delia glared at her. &#34;Now I have to kick you off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Delia&#34; Laurel gasped as a scent she hadn&#39;t recognized in her past life came to her nose. Tart, bitter, and a bit like stagnant water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was coming from Delia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You You&#39;re the one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia blinked at her, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the one who killed me&#34; Laurel said, wide-eyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia&#39;s eyes widened before she threw her head back and laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really hoped Basil was just drunk again when he said it, but it seems he wasn&#39;t!&#34; Delia grabbed a handful of her hair and pulled the jeweled clip free. Her hair unraveled in the wind as Laurel scrambled to get a hold of Delia&#39;s dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fabric ripped as Delia pushed her back. She struggled, but Delia was much stronger than she looked, likely because she was a rogue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is your problem?&#34; Laurel screeched, digging in her heels. &#34;Basil loved you! He wanted to give you everything. Why would you kill me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Poor little Laura,&#34; Delia scoffed. &#34;Just go over the cliff like a good girl and get out of my way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel pushed harder, trying to buy some time as she reached through to Adolph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*The cliff, Adolph!* *We&#39;re at the cliff.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt his panic through their bond and his haste, but Delia growled, shoving her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt the edge of the rock then nothing as she stumbled back into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia grinned as Laurel went over the edge, waiting to hear the same scream from before, but it didn&#39;t come and Laurel didn&#39;t fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gems in Laurel&#39;s necklace lit up and shot a beam of light into the sky, keeping her perfectly suspended in the air, unharmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; Delia hissed, looking at her floating in the air. &#34;Damn you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia turned as Laurel remained floating in the air, panting in terror and looking at her wide-eyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know how long it would take to get her down, or what else would happen, but Delia&#39;s best bet to survive the night was to escape now. Maybe the magic would wear off, but she couldn&#39;t chance it now, especially if anyone had noticed them leaving together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried back towards the manor and tried to dive aside when she heard running footsteps, but the sight of him, red-eyed and furious struck her silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph growled at her, &#34;Seize her. I want her questioned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He charged past as Delia tried to find the strength to escape, but the three guards who had followed him grabbed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t struggle, it will only make it worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of me! I am the prince&#39;s wife! You don&#39;t have the right to touch me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take her back to the castle and put her in the dungeons,&#34; Basil&#39;s voice drifted towards her on the wind. Her jaw dropped open at his words. His expression was cold as he looked at her. &#34;Put her in the cell next to Tina&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph charged through the forest towards the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel!&#34; He called. &#34;Laurel!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He prayed he would make it. Prayed that the beam of light would lead him to her still alive and well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Goddess, if ever I have been worthy, I beg you.* *Please don&#39;t take her from me*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached the cleared outcropping of rock and skidded to a stop in shock as Laurel remained floating in the air, her breathing coming out in hurried, short breaths. Other than her hair whipping around in the wind and the bit of dirt on her gown, she seemed otherwise unharmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph walked forward, a bit frightened that she would just plummet into the canyon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel, darling, I&#39;m here&#34; He said calmly, reaching for her and bracing himself in case she did simply fall, yet when their hands met, she simply looked at him, eyes wide and frightful. He walked backward, holding her hand and pulling her floating body back over solid ground. When he was sure that she was completely safe, he pulled her into his arms.  &#34;I have you now,&#34; Adolph whispered, feeling her tremble. The light of the necklace died down and he felt her weight start to rest in his arms. He lifted her against his chest and turned back towards the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t speak, maybe too afraid or shocked. She shivered against him as he hurried back to the manor. Basil was waiting for him at the door with Chasel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve sent the guards to take her back to the castle to be put in the dungeon,&#34; Basil said, meeting Adolph&#39;s gaze. &#34;In a cell next to Tina&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph almost chuckled at that, &#34;Thank you for your quick thinking, Basil. You&#39;ve done well Though we may have to speak about your spiteful streak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil&#39;s eyes narrowed. He seemed a bit defensive but he relaxed and a boyish light filled his eyes with pride and happiness. His eyes flickered red for a moment before lowering to the ground.  He shuffled his feet and turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; Adolph said softly, &#34;Your eyes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil looked at him, &#34;My eyes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They were red just a moment ago. How long have they been doing that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil frowned, &#34;For a few months, I think since since Laura&#39;s death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Chasel asked, his voice as haunted as Adolph felt. &#34;That can&#39;t be possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was impossible for Basil to have the curse of the blood aura. He hadn&#39;t passed to him. He couldn&#39;t have passed it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand,&#34; Basil said, frowning as Gavin came to the back door. &#34;Your eyes turn red, father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is going on?&#34; Gavin asked, &#34;Why was Delia&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My wolf form&#39;s eyes glow red and have since I was born My eyes turn red in my human form because I am cursed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil&#39;s eyes widened and he looked terrified and distraught as he gasped, &#34;C-Cursed? But father- How are you- What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil&#39;s eyes flickered red and Adolph stepped closer to him, urging Chasel to ease away from him. Gavin flinched and stepped back several feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy,&#34; Adolph said, &#34;We will talk about it, but you must calm yourself for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Gavin, &#34;When he first shifted what color were his eyes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin blinked. He had no idea and that only infuriated him further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were not there when he shifted for the first time?&#34; Adolph asked. &#34;You allowed him to go through the shift alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;H-He wasn&#39;t I didn&#39;t Well, I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandfather doesn&#39;t know how to shift.&#34; A surge of panic went through Adolph as he looked at Basil who seemed deeply uncomfortable. &#34;No one at the estate did either I never asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph cursed himself, &#34;We will remedy that soon. I I am sorry, Basil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted his head, shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems I have failed you as a father more than I ever imagined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil blinked and looked away, &#34;You were defending the nation, father. You have never failed me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph wished Laurel was able to speak to him, but her breathing had just begun to even out into a slow draw and he had no wish to wake her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We return to the castle tonight. Basil, you are welcome to stay here if you wish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t,&#34; Basil said and looked at Laurel, &#34;Is she okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph nodded, &#34;She will be fine As for your wife&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil shook his head, &#34;I would expect nothing less for such a threat to the kingdom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil turned, &#34;I will get the carriages ready and have the servants pack our things and follow behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Basil left, Adolph smirked and looked at Gavin whose face was contorted with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would be careful, Minister Mirabelle,&#34; Adolph said as he walked past. &#34;It looks as though Basil has seen something in you he does not like and he takes after me more than you could have ever known.&#34;</p>
