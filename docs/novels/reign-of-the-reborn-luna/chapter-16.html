                <p>Basil beamed up at his father, overjoyed to see him. He didn&#39;t think he could have ever been happier than the moment the news came that his father had defeated the vampires, but seeing his father back in the Imperial City and being able to hug him made his heart swell with joy. When the news had arrived, he embraced Delia and commissioned new gowns for her to celebrate how much luck she seemed to have brought to the kingdom and prepare her to meet his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their wedding would be the perfect capstone and celebration of the werewolf kingdom&#39;s victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father,&#34; Basil said, placing his arm around Delia and presenting her to Adolph proudly. &#34;This is my mate and soon-to-be wife, Delia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trembled a bit but didn&#39;t resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia had been nervous since that morning. She&#39;d washed her hair three times, changed at least five times, and went through her entire jewelry collection trying to find an outfit that would make her look like the perfect daughter-in-law-to-be. Basil had tried to tell her that it would be fine, but he&#39;d let her do as she pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was normal that people were afraid of him. Even he was a bit afraid of his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph&#39;s expression lost all warmth and his eyes grew cold as they fell on Basil. Basil was a bit affronted by the sudden change. How could his father not be interested in his wedding at all? At his mate? Had he even looked at her fully?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cheeks burned. Did he not approve of her? How could he not, she was his mate!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph turned sharply, headed toward the castle doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chasel,&#34; Adolph called. &#34;Get the soldiers settled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph walked into the castle. The ministers hurried after him. Delia squeezed his arm, but before he could soothe her, Adolph stopped as if he&#39;d remembered something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and looked back at the procession, scanning the crowd before turning around and approaching a petite young woman. He had never seen her before and had no clue as to what she could be doing with his father. Her dress was cut from a rough material, so he supposed she was a commoner from somewhere in the kingdom. Maybe his father had rescued her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were as green as emeralds in her face. Her long black hair gleamed in the sunlight. Though she seemed a bit tired, there was no denying that she was a beautiful young woman. Still, he sneered. She was obviously a commoner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was probably just the maid in charge of washing the soldier&#39;s clothes. Basil would have to tell his father they had a full staff already, so she would have to find work elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tina,&#34; Adolph called, looking at the young woman. &#34;This is Laurel. Find her the best room you can in the castle and a good maid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil&#39;s eyes widened. What? Who was this girl?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is to have whatever she desires. Am I understood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tina stammered her response as the young woman, Laurel, turned bright red and a bit distraught. She was not nearly as surprised or troubled as Basil was watching the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty--&#34; she began as Adolph pointed to two soldiers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will be her lead guard for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty, that really isn&#39;t--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel,&#34; Adolph said, his tone more gentle than Basil had ever heard it. &#34;Go get some rest. It has been a long journey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel opened her mouth a few times to protest, it seemed, but eventually, she just lowered her head, nodded, and followed Tina and her new guards. Basil watched her go, curiously. He had never seen his father act that way towards anyone: protective, gentle, tender almost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who the hell was she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was gone, Adolph continued into the castle. Basil was about to order attendants to make sure his bath was run to his liking, but Adolph didn&#39;t turn towards his wing. Instead, he headed towards the throne room where official ministry meetings were held with the king. No one had entered the room since he&#39;d gone to the border for anything more than dusting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Draw the curtains,&#34; Adolph said as he walked in. Servants hurried forward to do his bidding as he approached the throne chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ministers seemed nervous, following behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty, would you not care for a--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me how my kingdom has fared in these past years,&#34; Adolph said and looked at Basil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grandfather, Gavin, stepped forward, clearing his throat, &#34;Quite well, Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph sat on his throne and glared at him, &#34;When has such an answer ever sufficed, Minister Mirabelle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O-Of course, Your Majesty. I only meant&#34; He cleared his throat and began to explain. &#34;The kingdom&#39;s exports have remained steady over the past four years, and&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire ministry entered the room along with Basil. Basil kept Delia outside for the sake of her nerves as his grandfather continued to answer Adolph&#39;s question, yet it didn&#39;t seem as though any of the answers were good enough for him. Adolph called for the account book of the kingdom to be brought to him while Gavin was answering him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the book in hand, his question grew more pointed starting from the harvesting revenue through the trade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the budgetary deficit?&#34; Adolph asked, &#34;What are all of these large expenses for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, well, I would need to see the accounts to be able to answer&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil frowned. It was such a strange question, and the questions that followed were even stranger. Why did Adolph ask about these things in so much detail? It was expensive to hold banquets and reward nobles for their loyalty. It was all normal, why was he causing such a fuss?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin felt a bead of sweat trickle down his forehead as he tried to finesse his answer. He had been a minister since Adolph first ascended to the throne over twenty years ago. He had been hoping that Adolph would have died during the war so that he could control Basil as he pleased. He&#39;d never been prepared for Adolph to return victorious and so keen to get involved with the affairs of the kingdom so quickly. There hadn&#39;t been enough time to manipulate the books.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, Prince Basil&#39;s previous wife, Laura, tended to spend a great deal of money on various, selfish endeavors. We admit that her whims were pricey and to the detriment of the kingdom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil sighed, &#34;That is true. She wasted so much money building hospitals for wolves who&#39;ve lost their mates. It was ridiculous since there are already so many hospitals. There was no need for a special one. Then, schools, and developing an orchard as if the kingdom doesn&#39;t have enough--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Adolph asked. &#34;Why an orchard?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin cleared his throat, &#34;She--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil cut his grandfather off, &#34;She said it was to provide the soldiers with good produce, but obviously, such a thing should have been left to the merchants and the farmers around the Imperial City! She wasted a lot of money on the orchard and delivery chain like an idiot--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin tried to cut in, &#34;What he--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph sneered at him, &#34;When did your luna die, Basil?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil grit his teeth, &#34;She was not my luna. She was just an ordinary woman She died four months ago. Apparently, she tripped over the edge of a cliff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph slammed the account book and glared at them. Basil stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Four months ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Yes,&#34; Basil said. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph sat back, his expression cold, &#34;For the past several years, the food delivered to the camps on the borders was immaculate. We never had a single problem with it and it was of great quality. I directed food monitoring efforts to the patrol and training to better utilize our manpower. Three months ago, someone poisoned a delivery of food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil gasped in horror as did the rest of the ministers. He knew the border was dangerous, but he had never imagined that the vampires had managed to poison a delivery. He never thought them capable of such a thing. It was a good thing that he&#39;d turned over such matters to the merchants when he did, or who knew how many other supply deliveries would have been poisoned?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vampires had poisoned the food in transit, hoping to kill me, specifically. Vampires seized the opportunity and attacked our camp. I was too late to respond and one of my most loyal warriors died saving my life. Luckily, my doctors had the antidote, and we were able to fight them off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil glanced at his grandfather. His expression was unreadable, but he could see the sweat rolling down his face. The rest of the ministers looked outright terrified. Why were they so nervous? It was a strange story, but his father was just fine, and giving the duty of delivering the food to the merchants had taken care of such things. Laura&#39;s little initiative had nearly gotten his father killed!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so glad that you&#39;re okay, father. If she--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is not to blame! You are!&#34; Adolph growled, &#34;Your idiocy nearly got me killed and cost the life of a good man!&#34;</p>
