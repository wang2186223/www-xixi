                <p>They had dinner that night and waited until morning to speak with the caravan from the Wiccan Alliance, inviting them to breakfast. It was strange to have most of his family and their guests at the table, but it was a state matter so they all had to be there.</p>

                <p>Laurel smiled at him, squeezing his hand and looking at Taliesin and the rest of the congregation. Each of them seemed troubled and resolute, but Taliesin smiled at her warmly. His eyes were red-rimmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The wars and battles have taken a great deal from all of us,&#34; Laurel said, &#34;I propose that we work together to try and heal those wounds in the ways that we can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin nodded, &#34;Wise words. What did you have in mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mentioned the curse that should have expanded over all of Morrigan&#39;s lands, but Annwn, a castle that is within her territory, did not seem to be under that curse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin smiled, &#34;I would not be surprised if by taking control of the castle and making it his base of operations that Eden broke the curse on that area.&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;Annwn is a mystery to me. As I said before, Eden&#39;s plans were his own. This place was under his protection and I can only assume still is under his protection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you help us deal with whatever protections that still exist on the lands and the curse?&#34; Laurel asked, &#34;It would be to both of our benefits to join forces to ensure that whatever evil Morrigan may have seeded among the populace isn&#39;t given room to grow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin nodded, &#34;You are right. Unfortunately, there are some things that cannot be torn down. The curse may take. Centuries to break by force. The protections on Ash castle are linked in some ways to the protections on Crystal castle&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel&#39;s eyes widened, &#34;What does that mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hummed, &#34;Think of it like a scale. The two castles and the Castle of the Sun within the Wiccan Alliance are all connected by Wiccan magic and our shared ancestry and connection with the sun and moon goddesses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To attempt to alter one too much might cause changes across the others that they couldn&#39;t anticipate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would be best to take stock of Ash castle&#39;s status and devise a plan regarding the barrier. It was meant to be defensive against attacks and respond to the animosity between the three.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel frowned looking at Adolph whose face was tight with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meaning that until the castle recognizes a alliance or a new leader, the barriers will remain in place and unchanged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taleisin&#39;s eyes widened and he looked at Laurel. She gave him a calm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you agree to meet with the forces on the border to survey the barrier on the way back?&#34; Laurel asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin nodded, &#34;It would make the most sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll have Eden brought up the day you depart,&#34; Laurel said, watching the shock blossom over his face. &#34;Or would it be easier for you to move him?&#34; &#34;I&#34; Taliesin glanced at Adolph, &#34;Whichever you are most comfortable with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph clenched his jaw, merely listening to the rest of the discussion. Laurel&#39;s tone was calm and dignified. He saw in Basil&#39;s expression a haunted expression that meant that Laura often spoke this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was logical and fair. It was hard to deny her anything as she laid out mutually agreeable terms for now and a timeline to meet again about further needs as they arose. His heart stirred with anger and his wolf was on the edge of bursting out and refusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How does this all sit with you, Adolph?&#34; Laurel asked, her voice gentle and calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin looked him in his eyes as Adolph warred with himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said that Laurel would be leading the talks, but it was ultimately his decision whether to agree with her suggestions or not. He could say no and undermine Laurel&#39;s will, but what would that get him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taleisin&#39;s grief had been real, hanging thick and sorrowful in the air as he spoke to Eden in soft tones and tried to hide his weeping, and Laurel was right. Eden&#39;s continued presence inside the castle would irritate him to no end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this so different than the old protocols of war back when the packs were still warring for dominance over one another? Allies and enemies were allowed to collect their dead from each other&#39;s lands after battles. Vampires had always been different as they simply revived given enough time, but the Wiccans would be better suited to the kingdom as allies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to give in for a chance at real peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As always, your wisdom is impressive,&#34; Adolph said and pressed a kiss to her hand. &#34;It is a great start to peace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taleisin&#39;s eyes softened and glimmered. He closed his eyes, bowing his head slightly as one of his compatriots, a young-looking man placed a hand on his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your leniency will not be forgotten,&#34; Taliesin said. &#34;If Eden wakes, we will inform you and bring him back to face your judgment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph nodded, but he wasn&#39;t certain that he could hold them to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, they walked the castle grounds with the envoy, showing them around as if they were just any foreign dignitaries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made plans to leave the day after. Adolph and a small group of guards led them around the Imperial City the day before they were set to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the day of their departure, Adolph allowed four of the Wiccans to descend into the dungeons and set up a magical gurney to guide Eden&#39;s floating body out of the dungeon. People gasped in shock and awe as they passed. The prisoners that had been captured along with Eden watched in awe, murmuring prayers and thanks as they went past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t hurt him!&#34; Someone pleaded. &#34;H-He just wanted to protect us&#34; Taliesin stopped and looked at the young woman pressed against the bars of her cell, her eyes flashing with vampire light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;P-Please&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dear girl,&#34; Taliesin said, &#34;Eden has never had a reason to fear me and he never will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened in shock, &#34;A-Are you Are you Taliesin?&#34; He frowned, &#34;You know me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eden spoke of you,&#34; she looked down. &#34;H-He said that if you had come to get him that he was g-gone&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sniffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eden is not dead,&#34; Taliesin said, &#34;Though what we should call his state is a mystery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded shakily, &#34;I&#39;m glad he gets to go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As am I.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked up the stairs towards the ground floor, turning the woman&#39;s words over in his mind. He could only imagine what sort of place Annwn was that people had followed Eden into battle against Adolph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They secured Eden inside one of their caravans and the guards returned their things to them. Taliesin turned to Adolph and Laurel with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is customary in our culture to offer gifts of peace after war and congratulations after marriage to new and old allies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph frowned as the six who had come with Taliesin stepped forward offering the boxes that had come with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Potions for healing and wellness. While we are aware that few things could hurt werewolves, we know those things are quite lethal. Antidotes to every poison that may be lethal to you, elixirs that will save you even if you are on the brink of death&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were charms for the health of newborn children and mothers, talismans of blessings of peace and protection, and more in the boxes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your gifts are well received,&#34; Adolph said stiffly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin smiled, &#34;You need not worry about testing them. The flasks are large enough for tests for poison and to still be of use.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph flinched as the man&#39;s eyes twinkled. Laurel stepped forward offering him the necklace. He shook his head and closed her hands over it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is a great mythos around you, White Wolf,&#34; he said. &#34;I am honored to have met you in my lifetime and to know that the mythos pales in comparison to the truth of who you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squeezed her hands around the necklace, &#34;This necklace was a gift to you, Luna Laurel. A sign of belonging, trust, and protection. It marks you and all whom you love as worthy of our protection and allegiance. Eden would not have given it to you if he meant for you to give it away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel frowned, looking at the necklace, &#34;You said protection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, &#34;The protections on it are immense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They didn&#39;t protect him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You misunderstand the protections if you think that is true,&#34; he shook his head. &#34;Perhaps at our next meeting, we can speak more of it. For now, just know that he saw something in your future and he meant for you to live through it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The necklace felt so much heavier with those words. She pulled it close to her chest as Taleisin bowed and nodded, shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could Eden have seen?</p>
