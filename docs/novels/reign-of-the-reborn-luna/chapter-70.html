                <p>The knight cried out in agony as he landed with a hard crash. Adolph&#39;s chest heaved as he looked down at the man who curled up on his side, clutching his left shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your left side is weak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My apologies, Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel shook his head as he walked onto the training pitch. He had only taken his eye off of Adolph for a few hours. He had expected him to go and sit by Laurel&#39;s bedside as he had been doing, but of course, he hadn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d have to apologize to the knights later for his oversight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty,&#34; Chasel called. Adolph turned his head stiffly, his eyes narrowed and too alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were sleepless and agitated. Chasel had been lucky to reach him so quickly and know exactly where Raven was in the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Raven would like to speak to you,&#34; Chasel said. &#34;She awaits you in the rose parlor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph was tense, but he nodded stiffly and excused himself from the training pitch. He watched everyone on the pitch let out a solemn breath of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My apologies,&#34; Chasel said hopelessly. &#34;It&#39;s been a rough morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man on the ground forced himself to his knees, clenching his jaw as he got to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get yourself to the doctor,&#34; Chasel said and turned, &#34;End training early today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The training instructor nodded before Chasel hurried to leave and get on with the search of Tina&#39;s room and sussing out any other accomplices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven was seated in the perfect position to be seen when he entered and to see him. He knocked, as polite as ever, before entering. She shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Running around on the training pitch will not make you feel better,&#34; Raven scolded. &#34;Neither will torturing your knights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grimaced, closing the door behind him and crossing the room. She&#39;d had a full meal prepared by the older staff who had been in the castle since they were children. There were cakes and pies that she knew he didn&#39;t indulge in often, a full pot of Maria&#39;s special petal jam, and several racks of roasted meat and vegetables to go with their tea and wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit,&#34; Raven said, nodding to the couch across from her. He sunk into the seat with a sigh. &#34;You need sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t,&#34; he said, clenching his hands together. &#34;I can&#39;t rest until-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel would tell you not to be ridiculous.&#34; He looked up, his eyes wide and glossy. She met his gaze. &#34;She would tell you that you have to take care of yourself to figure out who did this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph nodded shakily, &#34;I I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then eat and promise me you&#39;ll get some sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph&#39;s gaze dropped to the table. His lips twitched as he looked at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Petal jam?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, &#34;The number one way to make sure you eat. I&#39;ll be passing on all these secrets to Laurel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded and grabbed a leg of meat before starting to eat. She watched him eat for a while and when she was sure that he was relaxing she smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel is alive and you&#39;re doing everything you can,&#34; Raven said. &#34;But I&#39;m pretty sure your newest daughter-in-law won&#39;t make it long after she&#39;s well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph choked on his food, erupting into laughter that rang through the room. She chuckled watching his eyes twinkle with mirth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;m sure my son will have some issues with that, but if she brings it upon herself, there&#39;s nothing I can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven grinned, &#34;Don&#39;t let Irene hear you say that. She&#39;ll just stir the pot. She&#39;s already decided that your son is a lost cause and the kingdom is doomed if Delia is our luna for much longer than a week.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, looking at her seriously for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I miss you all,&#34; Adolph said, his lips twitching with a smile. &#34;I never realized while out on the battlefield how much I missed you all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had been no time for wishing to see them. He had barely managed to send letters letting them know that he was still alive, but the absence of them when he&#39;d returned, though it hadn&#39;t been exceedingly long, had only added to his exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven leaned forward and pat his hand, &#34;I promise we&#39;ll come to visit more once you and Laurel are married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph nodded, &#34;I&#39;d appreciate it if you all moved back into the castle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened staring at him, shocked into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one knows yet,&#34; he said. &#34;But I&#39;m planning to get rid of the ministry. They&#39;ve overstayed their usefulness and are conspiring against me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know what their goal was other than annoying him, but he didn&#39;t want to find out and he didn&#39;t want to chance them getting any sort of satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped, &#34;Adolph&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirked, &#34;It&#39;s time you all come home and I kick these idiots out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed, &#34;I look forward to it! Call Irene if you need reinforcements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph laughed again. His heart was still heavy, but he felt a bit relieved. He ate the rest of the meal, she had brought for him and let her convince him to lay across the couch and nap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t leave you,&#34; Raven said. &#34;Once you&#39;ve gotten some rest, I&#39;ll release you from my custody.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips twitched and he sighed, relaxing into the couch. It felt a bit like when he was a child and they would hide in a parlor for a bit of peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wondered what Laurel was dreaming of. Was she dreaming at all? Was she scared?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone tried to poison me,&#34; Adolph said as he slipped off into sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Conspiracy talks after your nap,&#34; Raven said. &#34;Though Irene and I agree.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Now get out of my castle!&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Basil&#39;s voice chased her as she ran through the howling forest. She wanted to stop and turn around to run somewhere else, but she couldn&#39;t turn. She couldn&#39;t change her path. She ran to the edge of the cliff and before she could stop a force shoved her forward and over the edge. She tumbled through the darkness and screamed until she found herself in the forest where she&#39;d woken up as Laurel.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Adolph?&#34; She called through the forest. &#34;Adolph where are you?&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*She ran through the trees calling for him as her eyes burned until she happened upon an orchard. It was the orchard from the portrait of Adolph in his youth. She heard a horse&#39;s hooves galloping towards her as a young Adolph rode towards her.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Adolph!&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Olivia!&#34; Her stomach flipped and she trembled. &#34;Olivia!&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*He rode past her and slid off his horse to sweep a faceless woman up into his arms with a loud laugh.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;I&#39;m back! We won.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Adolph,&#34; Laurel called. &#34;What about me?&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Adolph turned to look at her frowning, &#34;Why would I care about a dead woman?&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*A cold wind swept through the trees, lifting and carrying her away as she screamed in terror.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Adolph!&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel felt her body burning, but it faded away until she woke up under a dark sky full of twinkling stars.  She sat up and looked around. She recognized this place. The babbling brook had been sweet before, but now, it was full of terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t be dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm yourself,&#34; a voice started, kneeling beside her. &#34;You&#39;re not going to die, and you aren&#39;t dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel&#39;s jaw trembled, shaking her head. She could remember the strange taste in her meal. Then her chest clenched tight. She felt something in her burning and turning before she saw Adolph go pale as blood splattered across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adolph is just fine, dear one,&#34; she said softly. &#34;You are protected, but I cannot protect you from everything. You must be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stroked Daphne&#39;s face carefully, &#34;People are moving against you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled, &#34;I can&#39;t tell you that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34; She asked. &#34;Wouldn&#39;t it just be easier to do so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are&#34; she sighed. &#34;Things at work that must happen for the sake of the werewolf kingdom. The white wolf must stand in defense of the werewolf kingdom. The black wolf is your sword and you are his shield.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daphne shook her head. None of that made any sense. The goddess smiled as she pushed her gently back into the darkness. No dreams or memories chased her this time, but she rested in the place between the moon goddess&#39; world and the real world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice appeared beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Someone tried to kill us again*, Alice said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded solemnly and wondered if she had to go back. What would she do when she woke up? Would it hurt? Would Adolph be there for her? Would he be there at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel had no family, but she had Lily and Sarah. She had Chasel and Lynn. There was Sam and Raven, Irene, and everyone else she&#39;d met and became close to while in the palace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes burned with tears as her chest grew tight with terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been killed in her past life. Was sitting in the position of luna just a death sentence for as long as she held it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why me?&#34; Laurel asked into the dark. &#34;Why does it have to be me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did someone want to kill her again? The position of luna was the only logical explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could it have been?</p>
