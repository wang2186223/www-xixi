                <p>Taliesin and the rest of his group left the castle&#39;s grounds with a small group of guards that would guide them to the border camp. Laurel watched them leave, her stomach churning with nerves before she turned back into the castle. Adolph turned and followed her back to their rooms though he was certain that she didn&#39;t notice he was just behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He closed the door to their chambers behind him and leaned against it for a moment, watching her pace, clutching the necklace in her hands as she walked and muttered to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, he wondered if she did this often as Laura because she was used to being alone or if this was just the best way she could think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He only caught snippets of what she was muttering about, but it was enough to stoke his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden and the Wiccans were causing more irritation than he thought possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel&#39;s words about peace and the sentiment of forgiveness and healing wounds so that they could move forward were all nice in theory, but seeing her still holding on to what amounted to a keepsake from a man who loved her irritated him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was being childish and irrational, jealous over a man multiple times his age, and trapped in a coma for some undetermined amount of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped and threw herself onto the couch, placing the necklace on the table to just stare at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;... the priestess will be here shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up, jumping a bit as if she was startled by his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A-Adolph?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rounded the table to sit beside her, taking her hand and pushing the necklace away from them. She eyed it with a bit of fear in her eyes before he pulled her close and kissed her. She sighed in relief, slumping against him as he breathed in her scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked for a priestess to come to counsel me about these dreams I&#39;ve been having and the path ahead I will ask that she look at the necklace and all the gifts as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded shakily, &#34;It seems like we should just have a priestess stay here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph chuckled, &#34;One step at a time. I have already done away with so much. Too much change at once could be a disaster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, curling into him. She glanced at the necklace, unsure of how to feel about it other than being afraid. Taliesin didn&#39;t come off as a spiteful man or even as if he meant to cause trouble. It was a warning and an explanation, but not enough. What she would give to wake Eden up and ask him what he knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for going along with my plan I hope we don&#39;t come to regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph sighed, &#34;If we do, I get to burn the necklace at first chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled, &#34;Deal. We should have lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph smirked, pressing a kiss to her forehead, &#34;Here or downstairs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed, leaning into him, &#34;Is it wrong to want to have you to myself for a bit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are my wife and luna, you can have whatever you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled and nodded, &#34;Here then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph left her to tell the attendants to bring lunch to their quarters before returning to the couch and pulling Laurel close. They said nothing, but the necklace seemed to draw his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was inconsequential before,&#34; Laurel said. &#34;Now, it just feels monumental like I can&#39;t look away from it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want to agree, but he did. He picked it up and slipped it into her pocket. For now, it would solve the problem, but he could almost feel the heat and weight of it against his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant arrived with lunch and news that the priestess had arrived and was getting settled in her quarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When lunch was over, he had them bring the priestess up to speak with them as well as all the gifts Taliesin left with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel stood, throwing her hands up, &#34;This is ridiculous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph chuckled and drew her into his lap, &#34;There. There, my love. We&#39;ll get to the bottom of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a necklace! We shouldn&#39;t be so worried about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only meant to keep it to remind herself about Annwn and the peace that she had seen there. It was a peace that was possible with a little work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is not just a necklace,&#34; Adolph said as a knock sounded on the door. &#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened with the attendant and the priestess. He smiled with relief seeing her, his younger sister, there. She smiled as Laurel looked up at her and smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Praise be to the moon for your health and the precious life you carry,&#34; she said, coming closer and sitting on the couch across from them. &#34;How may I be of service to you, Your Majesties?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel looked at Adolph and Adolph reached into her pocket before she could mention his dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Foremost, this necklace&#34; Adolph offered it to her, &#34;What can you tell me about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took it and turned it over in her hands, &#34;It is quite a powerful charm, Your Majesty. Old power, why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harmful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Completely protective,&#34; she clarified, offering it back to him. &#34;It will come in handy for Her Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph closed his hand around it as a strike of terror went through him. She looked at him, her eyes flashing with moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The dreams that wake you so often are warnings, Your Majesty. Take heed of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph grit his teeth looking at the necklace before looking at Laurel. She was pale and staring at the necklace. He unclasped it and slipped it around her neck before adjusting the hem of her gown to cover it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want you out of my sight without it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel&#39;s eyes searched his before she nodded, &#34;I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The priestess laughed, &#34;So grave. Not every warning is a warning for tomorrow! What else can I help you with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another knock sounded on the door, &#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attendants came in carrying the boxes with polite smiles before setting them on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We received these gifts.&#34; Adolph said. &#34;I wanted to be sure they&#39;re safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, &#34;Such doubt Though I suppose you can&#39;t help yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked over the boxes, opening each one of them in a show of perusal. Adolph sighed as Laurel leaned forward watching every expression that crossed her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elizabeth,&#34; he said softly. Her eyes shot up at him, wide and a little startled before a mischievous glint appeared in her eyes. &#34;Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged and sat back, &#34;Safe. Plenty safe and very generous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel frowned looking between the two of them. Adolph eyed her, &#34;Since you are here, Lizzy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wrinkled her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have heard about the lift on the ban, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze drifted away, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you and Aunt Giselle consider coming home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened, staring at him and Laurel looked at Adolph with a huff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you said too much change too quickly could be a disaster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph smiled at Laurel kindly, &#34;You are the one who suggested it and if there is danger lurking within the next decade, I&#39;d rather have them here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked back to her and she fiddled with her gown, &#34;I I would like that very much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sniffed and wiped her eyes furiously, &#34;Addy&#39;, must you always make me cry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph&#39;s face turned bright red and Laurel barely refrained from laughing as she looked at Adolph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scowled at her meaningfully, &#34;Don&#39;t say a word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not,&#34; Laurel said primly. Her lips twitched with a laugh. &#34;Addy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph growled at her as Elizabeth turned her head, looking out into the distance and frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you should restrict your son&#39;s access to alcohol a bit more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph groaned and stood, &#34;Get acquainted. I&#39;ll make arrangements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took no time to find his son. He only ever got drunk in his room these days. He should have known that the conversation with the Wiccans would have been too much for him to take after realizing that Basil&#39;s haunted expression was anchored in his memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t bother to knock and opened the door to find Basil splayed across the couch. The scent of alcohol hung heavy in the air. He sat on the chair across the table from him and he grabbed the bottle and found it only half empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m only half drunk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph chuckled and took a drink from the bottle, &#34;I&#39;m sure, son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil&#39;s eyes burned as he looked at his father, &#34;It&#39;s not fair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That I don&#39;t get a chance to make it right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was terrible and I don&#39;t know why I should be wishing her well, but I can&#39;t Not even with you.&#34; He reached for his chest, rubbing. &#34;I feel terrible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph narrowed his eyes at him, taking stock of Basil before setting the bottle aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When is the last time you shifted, Basil?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shifted?&#34; He frowned, his head lolling back. &#34;I don&#39;t I don&#39;t remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph clenched his jaw and got Basil off the couch and to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No more alcohol and you&#39;ll cooperate with the healer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, father,&#34; he said, dazed as Adolph pulled his shoes off and put him in his bed. He pulled the blanket over him as his stomach began to churn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil, for all of his faults, was an alpha wolf like he was. There was no reason that Basil wasn&#39;t shifting to his wolf form regularly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was wrong.</p>
