                <p>It was the first time anyone in the palace had cared enough to ask why she was crying. This wasn&#39;t the first time she had faced a moment like this, but Basil had never cared about her. His ministers had cared even less and usually went out of their way to embarrass her. Noblewomen often disrespected her without being scolded for it by Basil or anyone who should have been on her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always had to defend herself; thus, Laura never cried because it was useless to cry. Crying was unbecoming of a luna, and no one cared about her feeling anyway. She had to handle every obstacle, every setback, and every difficulty on her own and with all the grace of her station. She knew that and that in the back of her mind, Laura was trying to pull it together, but it had been so long since she&#39;d been Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was Laurel now. Hadn&#39;t she committed to it? Hadn&#39;t she committed to being just a young girl born on the border?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Adolph shouldn&#39;t have made her burst into tears, but it seemed that every grievance Laura had ever had was flooding her mind. She knew she should explain what happened and ask Adolph to judge the situation fairly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should wipe her tears and speak calmly. That&#39;s what Laura would have done, and it&#39;s what Laurel should be doing if she meant to be taken seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Laurel couldn&#39;t speak. Tears streamed down her face uninhibited as if from a great well of sorrow she had never noticed in her heart. She cried like a child whose bullies had stolen her only toy and had no one to call to help her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How humiliating! How could she cry like a child and ever think she could meet Adolph&#39;s expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to cover her face with her hands and turn away, but Adolph held her jaw firmly, wiping her tears with such a gentle hand that she couldn&#39;t help but sob harder. Why was he being so kind to her? Why waste such kindness on a rude country girl?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had there been no one to care for Laura, the luna, when she needed it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t cry, darling,&#34; Adolph said softly. &#34;You&#39;re breaking my heart. What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were such ridiculous words: soft and corny. She let out an incredulous laugh, breaking her sobbing. It was so horribly romantic, like something a fairytale prince would say to his love, but they helped her find the words and give them voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A few tears could break our king&#39;s heart? The great Vampire Destroyer? How could I have committed such a sin? What would the people say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph also smiled at her with a little huff of laughter, &#34;I certainly need my mate to love and care for me too. Aren&#39;t all werewolves such creatures? I am not as tough of a guy as you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel stared at him, trembling and shocked at his honesty, humility, and gentleness. Basil would have never admitted that he needed anyone, let alone to her. She sniffled and composed herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she said sincerely and pulled the box towards her to show him the damaged dress. He barely glanced at it before drawing his gaze back to meet hers. &#34;It was such a beautiful gift, but I let it get damaged&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,&#34; Adolph&#39;s tone turned cold and his gaze was piercing as it swept up towards Basil and Delia, &#34;Then, why are you two here? Don&#39;t tell me you just came to laugh at her for damaging her dress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia bowed her head deeply, not daring to speak at all. Basil was frozen and silent, staring at Adolph and trying not to sweat under his father&#39;s piercing gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he defending her? Adolph narrowed his eyes and his jaw clenched. Basil&#39;s heart jumped seeing his father&#39;s obvious discontent. He had to shift the blame back to the girl and keep his father from being upset with him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;N-No, father, we were just passing by. It&#39;s not our fault the girl didn&#39;t value the dress and--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel flushed. Her eyes were red from crying, but they glared at Basil and turned glossy with tears again. Her jaw trembled as if she was going to cry again or yell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph wasn&#39;t sure which it was, but he knew Laurel wasn&#39;t the type of person to not value a gift. She wouldn&#39;t have apologized if she felt no remorse about it. He looked at the maid nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What just happened?&#34; The maid dropped her gaze and glanced timidly at Basil, yet she did not speak. Adolph lifted an eyebrow at her silence and defiance. &#34;I don&#39;t need a maid who can&#39;t speak or follow my orders in my service. You are dismissed. Leave the castle immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped and her face was stricken with fear, &#34;Y-Your Majesty-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph turned to the two guards nearby, &#34;One of you escort her out of the castle. The other will tell me what just happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the guards lunged forward, grabbing the maid who was trying to plead for her job and hurrying away with her, leaving his comrade to face Adolph. They had barely rounded the corner when the remaining guard began to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-Well Miss Delia called us, saying that the woman had insulted the prince. Then, she tried to take the boxes from her. During the struggle, Miss Delia tore the dress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia shook her head, &#34;N-No, I&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph looked at Delia, &#34;How did Laurel insult Basil?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S-She called him a thief&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph scoffed as Delia went quiet. Adolph knew Laurel had a fiery spirit. She had cursed dozens of soldiers in the middle of the army&#39;s camp. Apparently, her ire wasn&#39;t restricted to just negligent military officers. Her boldness was refreshing, but more importantly, she wasn&#39;t the type to say such a thing without reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia&#39;s eyes were cast low, yet focused on the symbol of the dressmaker and Adolph shook his head. Delia must have wanted the dress. Basil had likely ordered it to be taken from Laurel when she had refused to give it up, so they fought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How *ridiculous*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted an eyebrow at his son with a sneer, &#34;When did you develop the hobby of wearing gowns?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil&#39;s face turned bright red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Taking a gown from a young woman? Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth to speak and closed it tightly, glancing at Delia before lowering his head. Adolph watched his expression morph into one of humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil wanted to defend himself, but he couldn&#39;t risk exposing Delia to his father&#39;s wrath. He loved her and he had no idea what his father would do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel smothered a little giggle watching Basil hang his head and dead with the humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your hobbies aside,&#34; Adolph continued. &#34;Your fiancé damaged her gown, so you will commission a new one for Laurel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil grit his teeth but gave him a stiff nod. Laurel was stunned. Basil had never commissioned a dress for her, not even when they married. Laura had dreamed of the day it would happen, yet Basil would have a dress made for Laurel who would never willingly touch anything Basil gave her. The irony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph looked at Laurel, &#34;As for you, based on the scene, you wanted to speak to me about the invitation. Shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered his hand to her and Laurel hesitated. Anxiety churning in her. With a deep breath, she took his hand. He allowed her to collect the boxes as well as the invitation before leading her down the hallway. She cast one last look at Basil&#39;s bright red face before turning ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph led her up several flights of stairs. From the changing view, she figured that they were going to the highest floor of the castle. She&#39;d never known that the top floor belonged to him. She had arranged for the maids to do the daily cleaning for the entire castle, but she had never been to this place in her past life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph opened the door to his neat office. To her surprise, it was more functional than decorative. There was a sofa and two chairs arranged around a low table, a large desk covered with papers, and a large bookcase that wrapped around the room. The few decorations were of gold and red, but also seemed to be function.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was strangely fitting of Adolph&#39;s character.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maids,&#34; Adolph called down the hallway. &#34;Please take these from her. Everything but the invitation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pair of women came to her and lifted the boxes from Laurel&#39;s arms with a little curtsey in her direction before leaving as quickly and as quietly as they came. The door clicked behind them and Adolph gestured to the couch. She didn&#39;t want to get too comfortable with Adolph when she was already nervous. Knowing him, he might manage to convince her to change her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel set the invitation on the desk and met his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You brought everything back to me This can&#39;t be a sign of acceptance.&#34; Adolph narrowed his eyes, looked at Laurel. &#34;So... Are you rejecting me?&#34;</p>
