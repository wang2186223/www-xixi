                <p>Adolph sighed into the open air as the carriages were prepared. Laurel tottered out of the castle towards him and he led her down the steps. She pouted and Adolph knew she was going to protest his care for her again. She was so stubborn lately though it was clear that she couldn&#39;t move around the way she was used to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always been under the impression that a pregnant woman would appreciate being doted on and spoiled, but Laurel had always managed to surprise him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am just fine,&#34; Laurel said. &#34;I can walk on my own, you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I let you walk from the stairs to out here on your own,&#34; Adolph teased, &#34;From our bed to the bathroom the bathroom to the parlor-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough,&#34; she stuck out her tongue at him. &#34;You&#39;re not funny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you are just not in the mood to find me humorous,&#34; Adolph said and pressed a kiss to her temple. &#34;Let&#39;s get going, hm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She allowed him to help her into the carriage and he climbed in after her. He still wasn&#39;t completely used to riding in a carriage after sitting horseback for years, but Laurel had been firm about not wanting to be in the carriage by herself. In her defense, it was easier to agree when he was nervous about agitating his curse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still wasn&#39;t sure if it was just agitation and anger, or if sights and smells would set him off. He didn&#39;t want to find out the hard way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel waved them goodbye with a promise that he would keep things under control. Adolph trusted him implicitly, but he also knew that with Raven, Lily, and Sarah taking over Laurel&#39;s duties and the support of his other family members Chasel would be doing a lot less work than he first imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was probably another reason that the ministers had worked so hard to make sure that the only people in the castle were those who stood to inherit it. So much direct support would have made their positions unnecessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back considering the way the kingdom had changed. If they could get through the rest of the clean-up, maybe he would feel more at ease. Basil was doing well in his training. Depending on how he felt when he returned, Chasel might be training him to manage other aspects of the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With any luck, that would go well and the kingdom would reach a state of peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel might accidentally find some time to find a mate of his own if that happened. He chuckled at the thought. Chasel had been at his side for so long, it would be a bit strange for him not to be, but if there was any man he knew who deserved happiness, it was Chasel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked back over to Laurel and found her already curled up against the window sleeping. He smiled at how at ease she seemed, leaning against the carriage&#39;s wall. He pulled off his cloak and draped it over her before going back to watching the scenery going past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They arrived at the temple within a few hours. By then, Laurel was stirring and blinking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Had a good nap?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel blinked at him and smiled, &#34;You didn&#39;t sleep at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t been sleeping much lately. She worried that it was a part of the curse or making it worse. He grinned at her. His eyes were alert but they were tired. A bit of his age was showing on his face and it made her heart clench in terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. It&#39;s funny since I&#39;ve fallen asleep on horses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel winced, &#34;How dangerous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph chuckled, &#34;Well, I was much younger then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel sighed as the carriage came to a stop, &#34;I hope our child isn&#39;t so reckless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned, &#34;I hope she has your eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel looked at him, &#34;You want a daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph shrugged, &#34;I&#39;d be happy either way. I&#39;d want him to have your eyes too. The Raymond blue is boring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed, &#34;I&#39;m pretty sure there are plenty of people who would disagree.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph climbed out of the carriage and helped her out. Just as before, they changed clothes in the entry building, except Laurel needed help out of her dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally got into the temple robes she sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was all of my gowns to be made out of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph laughed as he tied the sash around his waist, &#34;I could ask, but it&#39;s unlikely to happen, and as soon as the baby is here, you&#39;ll think differently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel sighed, turning and playing with the fabric, &#34;That&#39;s fair I doubt they could make a corset out of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snorted, &#34;Among other things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They greeted the head priestess before getting settled. He&#39;d always felt calmer while in the temple, but this was the first time that the peace of the temple felt almost heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could barely keep his eyes open, stumbling through the temple halls during the arrival procedures. The peace and tranquility felt so heavy, he wasn&#39;t sure how he made it through eating dinner, but soon after that, they retired to their room and Adolph fell into bed with barely a murmur of goodnight to Laurel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel opened her eyes to a dark sky filled with stars. It was a scene she remembered seeing and never wanted to see again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; She cried, sitting up. The moon goddess chuckled from beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ease your heart. You are not dead. You are simply communing with me while in my temple. It is much easier to speak with you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded a few feet away to an area of grass where Adolph lay sleeping in the moonlight, peaceful and motionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did well to bring him here, Laurel,&#34; she said. &#34;I can help for a while yet, but it is not a fix.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this about the curse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, her expression turned grave, &#34;I am not all-powerful, nor omnipotent, but I see a great deal. The curse he is under is far harder than you think it will be to lift&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I do?&#34; Laurel asked, &#34;Would Taliesin or Eden be able to help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are people in Taliesin&#39;s fold that will be able to help one. He will send her to you if you only ask, but that isn&#39;t what is important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel frowned, &#34;Then what is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The blood aura is not a curse by itself, but a symptom,&#34; she said. &#34;Of course, wolves who had seen as much war as your husband has will have a blood aura, but his is also a part of a true curse. It will drive him insane until he dies, Laurel, if you do not lift it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking how!&#34; Laurel huffed, &#34;This isn&#39;t the time to be cryptic!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled, &#34;It will dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will also need Basil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel drew up short, frowning at her, &#34;What does that mean? What are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil would never curse his father. He wouldn&#39;t have the chance or resent him enough to do so. Basil was an idiot and selfish, but he wasn&#39;t fool enough to think he was ready for the throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, she was saying something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gavin?&#34; She ventured, &#34;But&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She closed her mouth meeting the goddess&#39; gaze as horror and fear took over her. The scent of blood twined with cedar and roses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia&#39;s favorite flower had been roses. She had proclaimed loudly that she had loved him, but had it been true love or an obsession? What lengths would she go to try and secure his love?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Olivia?&#34; Laurel asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and gestured to a basin of water nearby, &#34;I&#39;m showing you this so you know where to look and you can understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel leaned over the basin and peered down into the basin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia was alone in the room, holding a squirming bundle. She was sweaty, her eyes were overflowing with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;You&#39;ll carry all my hopes won&#39;t you, little one?* *You&#39;ll make sure he joins me the way he should&#34;* She sniffled, *&#34;If he loves the battlefield so much, let it drive him mad.* *May every drop of blood wash away his sanity until he is lost.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air around her seemed to shimmer and grow dark, a large spectral ghost drifted around her. Her eyes glinted gold and Laurel gasped in terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Then Then we&#39;ll be together forever&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The baby squirmed and cried out as the dark spirit slipped into him. The door opened out of the view of the pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Luna Olivia!&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A younger Tina rushed towards the bed and took the baby from her arms. Olivia leaned into her, giving her a small vial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Promise me, Tina.* *Promise that you won&#39;t serve another queen so long as Adolph is on the throne.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;I promise.* 8Just hold on-the doctor-&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia let out a soft gasp and relaxed back into the bed, staring out into nothing.</p>
