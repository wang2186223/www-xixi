                <p>Gavin paced his office with a slow gait. The room had once been a meeting room for all of the ministers so he could watch them carefully, but now he was alone in the room to contemplate the path forward and relatively powerless. He held no sway with Adolph and even less with Laurel. Basil was so entrenched in pleasing his father and losing himself to drink that he was useless to his plans. Even if he wasn&#39;t, Basil was better left untainted by the things that Gavin planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Basil was ever considered entangled with a treasonous plot, the Mirabelle name would never be the same, Olivia&#39;s memory in the eyes of the people would forever be tarnished and he needed what little was left of her and Adolph&#39;s love story to help put Basil on the throne whether Laurel&#39;s child was a boy or a girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially if she birthed a boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cursed. If only he had kept a closer eye on the staff of the castle before and after Laurel had cleaned out the palace. He could have snuck a few sleeper agents among the staff and wouldn&#39;t be scrambling to find someone who could be bought or bribed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel had done an impeccable job eliminating every potential entry point by the nobility. All the people who had remained had proven their loyalty to the crown and could not be bought. The few who could have been coerced through threatening their families were secure and loyal to Laurel for making their jobs easier by outing the spies of the noble families and replacing them with hardworking people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the people inside the castle weren&#39;t a problem, then everyone who was along the supply chain of the castle&#39;s supplies was problematic. The castle was slowly shifting towards being fully sustained by the slowly expanding orchard and very selective farmers who were based in the noble packs with direct blood ties to the royal family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could have argued that it was favoritism that undermined the purpose of expelling the other royal family members, but after Adolph had abolished that ban and brought his family back into the palace, Gavin had no standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were rumors that he was even inviting the royal members who had gone into the temple back to the castle! With them around it would be near impossible to sneak poison into anything with any efficacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His only hope then, to stage an attack or to poison Laurel would be to host an event away from the castle, but to what end?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the calendar and froze. A maddened smile crossed his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How fortuitous. It was merely a few weeks before his birthday! As the father-in-law to the current king and the grandfather of the crowned prince, he had every right to request their presence at his birthday party. He could limit the list to keep Adolph&#39;s siblings and cousins out and control every aspect of the food supply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left his office and grabbed his traveling cloak before finding a servant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Servant, where is my grandson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man looked uncomfortable, &#34;I believe he is in his rooms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin huffed. No doubt drunk. He swept past him, &#34;Ready my carriage. I wish to return to my estate. Notify the king that I will be taking the prince with me to prepare for my birthday celebration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man nodded and escaped as Gavin headed up the stairs. He called one of his guards to follow him and reached Basil&#39;s rooms quickly. He knocked quickly but there was no answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the door, calling out, but Basil wasn&#39;t inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned and turned back, considering where else he could be. He headed back downstairs towards the kitchen when he saw Basil stumbling down the hallway. His eyes were glowing with wolf light, dazed as he stared up at the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin grit his teeth and went to him, &#34;Basil, come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil didn&#39;t respond as Gavin grabbed his arm. He tugged stiffly and the man stumbled forward, stilted. This close he could see the pallor of his grandson&#39;s skin, but he didn&#39;t heed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been looking ill. I think a bit of fresh air away from the castle is in order, don&#39;t you? Won&#39;t you help your grandfather prepare for his birthday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm?&#34; Basil grunted, stumbling after him through the halls. Gavin pulled him along until they reached the front gates where his carriage was waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got Basil into the carriage with some effort and climbed in after him. His guard climbed up into the driver&#39;s seat and they were off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips twitched at how easy it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the vampire queen wanted to kidnap Basil, it would have been much too easy. Out of the window, he noticed two knights on horses following them and clenched his jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not quite that easy. He opened the window and looked at the nearest knight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you and why are you following my carriage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was ordered, by His Majesty, to follow His Highness should he leave the castle unexpectedly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin huffed, &#34;Surely a grandfather is allowed to take his grandson on a trip?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surely you would not be against extra security for yourself and His Highness given his state?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin sucked on his teeth and closed the window, looking across the bench at Basil as he was slumped against the other wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked pitiful, but Gavin didn&#39;t have time to pity him or scold him much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basil, you need to answer all of my questions,&#34; Gavin said. &#34;What do you know of Laurel and His Majesty&#39;s relationship?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil&#39;s head drooped, &#34;It&#39;s perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No relationship is perfect, Basil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandfather, you don&#39;t understand,&#34; Basil whined, falling back. He was fading out of coherence, but he didn&#39;t smell of alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have you drunk, Basil?&#34; Gavin hissed at him. &#34;How unseemly for a prince-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, shut up!&#34; Basil cried, pushing him away from him. &#34;Leave me alone! I haven&#39;t drank anything but that horrible medicine from the healer! Father said Father said I couldn&#39;t drink, so I&#39;m not, and&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin frowned watching Basil curl into himself with a low, pained whine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Laura I&#39;m sorry&#34; Basil sniffled, gripping his head. &#34;Did you come back just to see me like this? Will you forgive me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basil,&#34; Gavin started. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel,&#34; Basil sniffled. &#34;Laurel is Laura She&#39;s come back. I know it sounds crazy, but it&#39;s true I&#39;d know her anywhere I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m sorry&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin watched Basil devolve and go still as he slipped into sleep, curled up on the couch. He was beside himself, but if Adolph had told him he wasn&#39;t to drink, then Basil hadn&#39;t drank anything alcoholic since the order had been given.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Laurel being Laura made sense He grit his teeth. How could he not be suspicious of how easily the country girl had taken to court politics? How she came back wasn&#39;t important, but getting rid of her sooner rather than later was more important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been a nuisance at Basil&#39;s side, easily corralled as Basil was wrapped around his finger, but Adolph was not a man who could be led astray from his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He considered his next steps, glaring down at his grandson. He was useless. His wife was an idiot. He needed something to distract Laurel and make her lower her guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gasped and smirked as a thought came to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her parents were still alive. Laura&#39;s parents were rude and conniving. She had cut contact with him while she was alive, but surely they would provide enough of a distraction?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left Basil and went to find his messenger to find the two of them. He didn&#39;t need to say much in the message to lure them in. They would jump at the chance to be invited to his mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they were here, he could use them as scapegoats for poisoning Laurel. The resemblance was striking enough that they would either weep or be furious. Either way, they were the best option he had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia walked down the hallway, turning over the elements of her plan. Getting rid of Laurel at Gavin&#39;s party was the best bet. If she was right, the Mirabelle estate was close to a cliff that she could shove Laurel over the edge and return to the party without ever being missed. She&#39;d have to time it properly and make sure that Adolph didn&#39;t see them leave together and was properly distracted when they did leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move it,&#34; someone said nearby. Delia looked up as a familiar scent hit her nose. She froze as the group rounded the corner and she was faced with the guards manhandling her parents down the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met and Delia&#39;s blood ran cold as they looked at her. Recognition flashed through their eyes and she wanted to shake her head to tell them to shut their mouths, but the name had already escaped their mouths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stella?&#34;</p>
