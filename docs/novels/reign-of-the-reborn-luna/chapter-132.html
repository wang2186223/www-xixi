                <p>*Grandson?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden had never mentioned having any family. Had he known that Taleisin was his grandson? And the Wiccan who cursed the lands, had that been Eden&#39;s father? The grief in the man&#39;s eyes as he told the story made her think that was the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He would not have parted with such a thing unwillingly&#34; Taliesin said, &#34;P-Please tell me what happened to Eden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph seemed tense beside her. She glanced at him with a little nod and he relaxed just enough to remain where he was, though his hand still rested on his sword.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eden pretended to serve the vampire queen,&#34; Laurel said calmly. &#34;He killed most of her generals and orchestrated an attack on the main castle. He did kidnap me from the imperial city to lure Adolph into the vampire lands. He said he was using me as leverage He also said that he&#39;d planned to allow Adolph to fall into a rogue state from our separation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin shook his head, &#34;Of course The curse of a blood aura&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph stiffened. He wanted to keep her from telling the man anything more, but Laurel continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adolph said that he drank from the vampire queen Adolph escaped and we rushed back to the camp on the border. He followed and attacked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin seemed troubled but she went on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He seemed out of it a bit. Not himself, until Adolph plunged his sword into his chest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin shuddered, shaking his head, &#34;I I understand&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, he gave me this and asked that Annwn be spared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened, &#34;Annwn&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned and Laurel looked up at him, &#34;You were not aware of Annwn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head, &#34;He was my heir in every sense of the word, but he did not share his plan with me I have known for a long time that it was a foolish hope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin grimaced, turning away from her and leaning down to pick up his staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eden&#39;s father died in Morrigan&#39;s castle. Eden, too, would have died there if things had been different,&#34; He shook his head. &#34;When he found his way to me as a young man, I pleaded with him to stay. I told him that his father&#39;s death wasn&#39;t something we could undo. Morrigan&#39;s evil had taken too much of us and we retreated behind our defenses allowing her to resume her reign of terror.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How cowardly,&#34; Adolph said, stiffly. &#34;And you call me a disgrace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin glared at Adolph, &#34;Morrigan&#39;s evil corrupted and stole more than you can ever imagine More than we thought could ever be regained until Eden returned to us A true daywalker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A daywalker?&#34; Laurel asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vampires and werewolves are children of the lunar goddess-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blasphemy!&#34; Someone cried, &#34;The goddess would never-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quiet,&#34; Laurel said, glaring at the man who spoke. He clenched his jaw and seethed quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wiccans are children of the sun,&#34; he continued. &#34;Morrigan heard of a prophecy about a child who could walk between the two worlds with ease, who might unite them and sought to have that child and control them Eden had several siblings before Morrigan sunk her claws into my son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed, &#34;It was meant to be a peace mission. A chance to establish trade and promote prosperity, to stop the war between us, but it did not work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taleisin&#39;s son fell for Morrigan&#39;s deception and agreed to marry him. When she fell pregnant and Eden was born, she waited and watched his development as much as he could be useful, but she did not believe him to be the one, so sure that the prophesied one had to be a daughter so that Morrigan could control her through her bloodline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She killed my son and attempted to kill Eden, throwing them in the blood reservoirs that flow through Ash castle and feeding the stones that form the barrier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your son cursed the land.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, &#34;But Eden was to be the curse&#39;s undoing&#34; He sighed. &#34;I am proud that he went after that witch. I am proud that he did what he thought was right, though I was against it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain in his eyes told Laurel enough of what he didn&#39;t say.  He&#39;d been against it because he knew Eden would either fail or die trying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was truly the end of her terror, but I knew since he came to us that he would die in his attempt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The vision of a Wiccan is a funny thing. We are given glimpses of our death. Eden told me before he left about the vision he had,&#34; Taliesin turned to Adolph, &#34;Of a man crowned in golden-red light, cloaked in dawn with burning red eyes impaling him and a young woman with green eyes and a crown of moonlight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel&#39;s eyes widened as he sighed, &#34;I had hoped that it wasn&#39;t true, but I I cannot argue with your words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned, &#34;Forgive our intrusion and the disturbance we caused. We will return to our lands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about the curse?&#34; Adolph asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Eden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin chuckled wryly, &#34;Even as powerful as I am, I could not separate Eden&#39;s ashes from the wind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eden wasn&#39;t burned,&#34; Laurel said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin frowned, &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We tried,&#34; Laurel admitted, &#34;Multiple times. We&#39;ve tried everything that would work on a dead body, but he is unchanged and unharmed&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taleisin&#39;s eyes widened, &#34;What How?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even the wound is closed,&#34; Laurel said, meeting his gaze. &#34;We don&#39;t know what it means. Magic has been lost to the werewolf kingdom for centuries What do we do with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin narrowed his eyes at her, seemingly trying to parse out the truth as Adolph took her hand and squeezed her hand. The rest of a caravan began to murmur with a little bit of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He gave you that necklace?&#34; &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you cannot destroy his body?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will find a way,&#34; Adolph said, tersely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adolph,&#34; Laurel said, &#34;Must you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He kidnapped you and plotted to kill me,&#34; Adolph said. &#34;He is the son of that evil woman. As long as he is alive, he is a threat to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*To us.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel squeezed his hand, looking up at him, &#34;I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph&#39;s jaw clenched, jealousy and anger stirring in his heart. What did that mean? How could he not be a threat to them and their unborn child?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Eden wanted to kill you, he would have,&#34; Laurel said. &#34;But he didn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I killed him first.&#34; &#34;Eden wielded lightning and magic,&#34; Laurel said. &#34;And he had every opportunity in all this time to kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The poisoned food? The poison attempt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither worked,&#34; Laurel said. &#34;He managed to kill several vampire generals who you and the army couldn&#39;t. He could have found a way if that was his goal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph couldn&#39;t argue with that and it burned even more that his death had been worked in as an aftereffect of his plot, a death of convenience rather than malice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what his full plan was,&#34; Taliesin said, &#34;I can only say that if you cannot destroy his body, it is not the goddess&#39; will for him to die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel looked at him, &#34;Would you like to see him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes grew hopeful, &#34;Yes, I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Adolph growled, pulling Laurel closer to him. &#34;He tried to kidnap my wife and you think for a moment I would allow his allies to see him when I have no idea how to kill him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel sighed, &#34;Adolph, don&#39;t you think you&#39;re overreacting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph pulled her closer, his eyes flashing protectively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin looked between them and smiled. Eden had truly offended Adolph on some deep level. Had he loved Laurel and his plan had changed to encompass her? Had she been the reason for his death ultimately or had it always been ordained that Eden would meet Adolph on the battlefield and fall?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know and he might never know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty,&#34; Taliesin said, &#34;If your methods have failed you, only magic remains. If Eden will wake up and remain impervious to your attempts on his life, would it not be better to be rid of him if possible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph glared at him, &#34;I will stab him through the heart every day if I have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your sword broke,&#34; Laurel said, looking up at him, &#34;PLease, Adolph, be reasonable. Will you feel calm knowing Eden could wake up at any minute inside the castle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s in the dungeons.&#34; &#34;I don&#39;t think our dungeons are equipped to deal with Wiccans.,&#34; Laurel said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin smiled, his eyes twinkling, &#34;Though if you wish, I would be happy to negotiate services to be rendered As I said we also came to establish a relationship with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph grit his teeth and glared around the group, &#34;Only you may go You will leave your staff and whatever other magical instrument you have behind. The rest of them will be sequestered in guest rooms, their magical instruments will be surrendered until you leave. I will not negotiate further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin offered his staff, &#34;By the moon and sun, we will do as you ask.&#34;</p>
