                <p>&#34;Laurel!&#34; Adolph screamed, drawing her close. His voice trembled as she remained limp in his arms. &#34;Laurel!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel&#39;s blood ran cold as panic and fear rippled through the room. He let the fear pass over him and turned to the nearest knight who seemed frozen in shock. Lynn looked like he was going to be sick. Sam&#39;s teeth were bared, furious and helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one leaves the castle ground,&#34; Chasel said. Sam&#39;s head snapped to look at him. &#34;Everyone from the guests to the lowest stable boy is to be confined on-premises. Close the gates and every path out of the castle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By your order,&#34; Sam said with a stiff nod before running to spread the order. He turned to Lynn who was tense and staring at him, awaiting orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spread the word, the Imperial City is on lockdown. No one leaves the city until the culprit is caught. Don&#39;t spook the citizens. The culprit may attempt to escape during the panic. I want barricades erected and guard posted on every major and minor road out of the city within the hour then the less known routes. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir!&#34; Lynn said, running from the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily and Sarah looked at Chasel beseeching and terrified, but he could address them personally. He looked at Lily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have the kitchen staff gathered, detained, and accounted for in a parlor near the lunar parlor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily nodded stiffly and turned. Sarah hesitated to look back towards the front of the room before running after her, likely to help. Sarah sniffled, trying to fight the tears as she thought of Laura. She couldn&#39;t be in the room, so she followed Lily, tears streaming down her face and hurrying to gather the kitchen staff while Lily went to organize all the other staff into other parlors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Sarah and Lily had disappeared down the hallway, Chasel called the two knights from in the hallway into the room to guard the door and turned back to scan the crowd as people began to gasp and panic. Adolph was calling Laurel&#39;s name almost frantically, but it was his duty to carry out the will of the king. Adolph would call for blood whether or not Laurel survived the assassination attempt and it was his job to make sure the proper blood could be spilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one stuck out to him at first glance, but Gavin&#39;s gaze seemed almost hopeful. The ministers looked as though they were holding their breaths in terror and uncertainty. Chasel slipped through the crowd carefully, casting his gaze around. For a moment, he locked gazes with Raven who nodded slightly and went back to scanning the room as she approached Adolph slowly. Henry was just behind her, just close enough to jump in front of her if Adolph tried to attack her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia watched on, shocked a bit that Tina had succeeded when she had failed. Eden moved out of the corner of her eye. He was closer to the front of the room, but she could see his profile. There was a flash of shock before his expression turned cold and furious and smoothing out. Her stomach flipped at the display of control as he started making his way towards the front of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph heard nothing but his own voice calling Laurel&#39;s name and begging her to say something. Her eyes rolled back into her head, her eyelids twitched as she began to convulse. He couldn&#39;t breathe. His chest grew tight and his wolf howled in fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt his power rippling, threatening burst free of his control. It was familiar. He never wanted to feel it again, but he couldn&#39;t find a way to calm himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel was dying. How much longer did she have? What could he do? Who could he kill for this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty,&#34; the priestess said gently. &#34;If I may?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He panted, heaving and glaring at the woman getting closer to him and reaching for Laurel. He knew she wasn&#39;t a threat, but he pulled Laurel closer to him as she continued to shake. He saw the flicker of red light jump between them as the priestess approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her Raymond blue eyes were calm and clear, honest and concerned. He knew that. He knew this woman wasn&#39;t his enemy, but his mate was dying and he was powerless to do anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have medical knowledge,&#34; she said, gently. &#34;Please let me help her if I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adolph,&#34; Raven said gently. He turned his head looking at her and meeting her gaze. Her blue eyes were just the same. Her voice was soothing, familiar: family. There was a quality to her voice that he recognized as closer than just family. &#34;Let her help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed and looked down at Laurel&#39;s pale face, breathing deeply trying to calm himself before nodding stiffly. She kneeled, and he lowered Laurel to the ground to let her examine her before turning to the rest of the assembly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all drew back as Raven stepped just outside of his peripheral. A growl rumbled from his chest as he dragged his gaze across the group. His mind slipped in and out of the darkness and red haze of fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel&#39;s heartbeat was erratic like a frightened bird and growing weaker. He took a step feeling his power ebb and rush to the corners of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone let out a frightened gasp and he saw the ministers stumble and fall. He darted across the room, grabbing the minister of finance and growling at him as the other ministers collapsed. Gavin had already broken away and ran towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you know?&#34; He growled, the man in his grasp trembled and fainted, slumping terrified and useless in his grip. He turned to an alpha he recognized as someone lobbying for power through the nobles and snarled at him. &#34;Was it you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man flinched away throwing up his hands in a sign of surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin reached the door as Adolph had turned on another group of people biting out harsh questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one is to leave,&#34; the guards said, blocking his path. &#34;By order of the Royal Beta.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of my way, you lowly soldier!&#34; Gavin shrieked, &#34;Don&#39;t you see what&#39;s happening? I&#39;m not going to stay here and be murdered!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards shoved him back several steps, glaring at him and flashing their teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one is to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another gasp of horror rippled through the room and Gavin turned and froze. Red light flickered and sparked around Adolph as he stood alone. The air seemed to shudder and heat around him. The scent of blood filled the air and oppressive darkness like the grim reaper&#39;s presence drifted over the room as Adolph snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If she dies&#34; Adolph growled as the red light grew and leaped out, pushing people nearby away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flickered with light then the red began to grow until his eyes were two burning red points in his face. Another terrified gasp filled the room and Gavin turned back to push against the guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of my way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden remained perfectly still, listening to Gavin&#39;s panicking voice and allowing Adolph&#39;s burning red gaze to pass over him. He kept his heart rate calm and observed Adolph as he clenched his hands and glared at the crowd. Fury was rolling off him in waves, but the madness of a rogue hadn&#39;t taken over yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph was still able to form words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On my faith in the moon goddess, everyone responsible will die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden gasped as a true spike of terror went through him as an illogical possibility went through his mind. Had Adolph passed over the threshold of becoming a true rogue once before and returned to his sanity successfully? It would make sense as to why he seemed able to control himself even though the sparking red lights were strong enough to push people back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that in some way the source of Adolph&#39;s incredible strength?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an incredible theory, but one that felt more plausible the longer Adolph remained glaring at the crowd, daring anyone to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing to be done for now other than to hope Laurel didn&#39;t die and wait until he could get Delia alone to figure out what she&#39;d done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breathing was erratic, indicative of oleander poisoning in wolves, but she was also convulsing as if she had ingested wolfsbane. Even at the smallest dose, a few drops of either should have meant death within the hour, yet Laurel was still alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know much about werewolves. Was it possible that certain wolves had resistance to poison? Was Laurel one of them? It would explain why she was still alive if she&#39;d ingested either poison, let alone both</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, the red light started to subside. Adolph&#39;s breathing slowed and the shaking that had taken over his body lessened and coalesced to an intermittent tremor in his arm, barely noticeable even at proximity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one is to leave the castle,&#34; Adolph growled. &#34;If you attempt and are caught, you will be killed on suspicion of treason.&#34;</p>
