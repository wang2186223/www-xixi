                <p>Laurel wasn&#39;t the only one who was disappointed with how the wedding turned out. Delia was too, and it was all Laurel&#39;s fault. She seethed at the thought of the strange girl in red, on the king&#39;s arm, who had stolen everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was supposed to be the most woman at the celebration. She was the bride, the prince&#39;s wife! Everyone should have been overjoyed to bestow their blessings upon her and lavish her with attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, Laurel was younger and more beautiful, and the fact that she was on the king&#39;s arm had certainly added to her allure, but it was Delia&#39;s wedding day! No bride should be upstaged on her wedding day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she arrived at the castle months ago, she had been enchanted by the luxury of the aristocratic life. The food was great; the dresses were beautiful, and all things she had never dreamed of owning were in her grasp. She figured out quickly that she would have all the luxury she wanted and all the power she needed to enjoy it so long as she became luna. Marrying Basil was the easiest path to that end. He and his wife didn&#39;t seem to get along anyway. Not that Luna Laura had been much competition. For all of her good looks, she had been the kind of woman who did not know how to please and control a man. She didn&#39;t even seem to know she could do so and was content to bury herself in her work and earnestness like an idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making Prince Basil fall in love with her had been simple with a little help and her skills. There had just been the matter of Laura still being the luna at the time. With Laura dead, the way had been clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all her hard work, now *Laurel* was around!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil may not have been worried about her relationship with the king, but he wasn&#39;t worried about much of anything. Delia wasn&#39;t foolish enough to think that King Adolph was so cold that his head could not be turned by a beautiful woman, but now that he was back with a woman Delia had to come up with a new plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil was just the prince. His wife was luna by default so long as Adolph remained unmated and unmarried, and Laurel was precariously close to getting that position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew what a man looked like when he was hooked on a woman. Adolph&#39;s fascination was obvious, shining in the man&#39;s eyes whenever he looked at Laurel. The thought that King Adolph the Invincible, known to be the coldest man in the kingdom had fallen for the charms of a little country girl was ridiculous, but it was the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how she looked at the situation: Laurel was a threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tina,&#34; she began as the woman entered her chambers. &#34;What do you think of that girl? Laurel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression hardened as Delia expected. Tina had been brought into the castle by Gavin and Basil&#39;s mother. She had been Basil&#39;s nanny when he was younger then became the head maid of the castle. Basil trusted her unconditionally. She used that fact to her advantage and took great pride in her position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tina was arrogant, thinking of herself as untouchable due to her connection to Adolph&#39;s late wife and Basil. She&#39;d spoon-fed Basil stories of his parents&#39; great love and told it to whoever would hear her as a matter of loyalty to her former mistress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That little&#34; Tina growled before seeming to remember herself. &#34;That little trollop is a disgrace to the royal family. The king has been taken in by her If my late mistress were here&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia almost wanted to roll her eyes. She wasn&#39;t even sure if Tina had any real loyalty to her former mistress, or if she just clung to the idea the way she clung to her position as the head maid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think she&#39;s up to no good?&#34; Delia asked, feigning fear. &#34;What about the kingdom&#39;s safety? To have the king be compromised&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tina&#39;s eyes widened and her cheeks turned red. Delia wasn&#39;t surprised how easy it was to rile Tina. She was a vulgar woman who gloried in her position and used it to cruel ends. She thought of herself as Basil&#39;s adoptive mother and tried to rule the castle&#39;s staff with an iron first, but she was just a maid. She had been cruel to Laura before she died, so Delia had considered her an asset in her plans, but it was annoying to have to pretend to be a good daughter-in-law to Tina. The woman was stupid and meddlesome, but it was a small price to pay for Basil&#39;s trust and the luxury she enjoyed. She&#39;d get rid of Tina at the right time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, Your Highness. You are the prince&#39;s wife. A princess in your own right and second only to the king and Prince Basil. No one will refuse your will&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia pretended to consider it, &#34;But what can be done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever you wish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia hummed, pretending to think it over. She looked at Tina hopefully before standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are right, Tina. That girl is just a soldier&#39;s daughter! She can&#39;t be allowed to continue her plans against the king. Gather enough maids to clear out her things from the castle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tina smiled and hurried out as if she had just been waiting for the chance. Delia went to the room Laurel had been staying in and directed the maids to dump all of the girl&#39;s things save the jewelry that was much too beautiful to be in that girl&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought back to the ripped gown and huffed. She wondered if Basil had managed to replace the gown yet. She hoped he hadn&#39;t wasted the money on the girl as she wanted a new gown of her own from that dressmaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Laurel arrived, flushed and furious. She struggled against the maids, but as Delia expected, she didn&#39;t have to move as Tina argued with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was exhilarating to see her so furious. It served her right for embarrassing her on her wedding day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Laurel was moved into this-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared at the maid beside Laurel before cutting her off. &#34;I am luna and I have the right to do whatever I want!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bared her teeth at Laurel, &#34;I will not tolerate the presence of someone as rude as you! Now, get out of my castle!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words echoed through Laurel&#39;s mind. The world blurred and shimmered. The scent of fine wine and the orchard drifted on the wind. She tried to fight it, but she heard Basil&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Get out of my *castle*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart raced. Her body trembled with fury and terror. She felt a bit sick as her eyes burned with tears. The wind had been cold then. The forest had passed in a blur. She could see the cliff stretching out to her death and her breath caught in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Sarah said, stepping forward. &#34;The king allowed her to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you mention the king!&#34; Tina shrieked. &#34;Sara, you wretched girl! You&#39;ve found another disgraceful woman to follow. Wasn&#39;t last time enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Ms. Tina-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think you can take my place, is that it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never in your life,&#34; Tina yelled, trembling with fury. &#34;It shouldn&#39;t even be something that ever crosses your mind, you wretched bitch. I should have gotten rid of you when that last wench did the kingdom a favor and died!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah gasped in horror, &#34;Ms. Tina-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah cried out as Tina struck her across the face and collapsed to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want to follow her? Follow her out of the castle and never come back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tina raised her hand again but was stopped as Laurel grabbed her wrist. Still shaking with fury and terror pumping through her veins. Her tears were streaming down her face, but she couldn&#39;t stand by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t been able to do anything last time when Sarah had been dragged away, but she wouldn&#39;t stand by and watch this play out the same way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rude?&#34; Laurel hissed, tightening her grip on Tina&#39;s arm as she tried to pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unhand me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You called me vulgar? Rude? A disgrace? I&#39;ll show you how rude I can be!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel threw Tina&#39;s hand away from her, drew back, and struck Tina across the face, sending her to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went silent as Tina collapsed and Laurel&#39;s heart swelled with the rush of revenge. Laurel glared at her. Tina turned back and looked at her in shock. Delia&#39;s mouth dropped open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel marched towards her and Tina scrambled back across the ground. &#34;Quick! Hurry and drag this woman out! Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their shock seemed forgotten just as Laurel grabbed Tina&#39;s skirt and pulled her back towards her. The maids grabbed her and hauled her back. The skirt of Tina&#39;s gown ripped as Laurel fought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go!&#34; Laurel growled, thrashing in their hold as Tina trembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quickly, get her out of-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could anyone treat a woman so rudely!&#34; A man&#39;s voice rang out. &#34;What is going on here?&#34;</p>
