                <p>Adolph Raymond breathed in the scent of his kingdom&#39;s lands with great relief. There was no blood, no pain or darkness: no fear. He smiled, guiding his horse in line with the procession as he breathed in the scent of the metalworks that Silver Blade was known for. It was sweeter than he thought it should be. Almost creamy like milk and honey warmed by the sun, sweet and tantalizing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. That scent wasn&#39;t the metalworks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adam growled with contentment. Adolf&#39;s wolf had never felt so at ease. He cast his gaze around searching for the source of the scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, he found the source of the scent. A young woman, likely younger than his son, was balanced carefully on a tree overlooking the procession. her long black hair gleamed in the sunlight like silk and the hem of her skirt revealing her plain shoes and pale ankles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips twitched at her reckless bravery. It could not have been easy to get up there in such a dress, let alone getting down. His heart clenched as stared at the young woman, transfixed and awed with disbelief, hope, and joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Mate!*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled the reins to stop his horse. How was this possible? He had hoped in his youth to find his mate, yet he had set that hope aside for the sake of his kingdom&#39;s stability and the production of an heir.  He could not remember the last time he had thought of the potential, so sure that the goddess would never bless him with such a gift, yet there she was after such a long war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps his epithet as the Goddess-Blessed King had some merit, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze met his and her eyes widened in shock. The bond sparked into an all-consuming warmth, filling him and burning away all the yearning and longing he&#39;d ignored for years. He pulled his horse away from the procession to get through the subdued crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would she be frightened of the blood that stained his aura, or would she be welcoming and thankful for his efforts? He wanted to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people parted for him and he approached the tree slowly, fearful of frightening the young woman. He held his breath, fearful that she might vanish into the wind as no more than a lonely man&#39;s dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped under the tree and stared up at her as she stared at him, speechless. Her heart was beating quickly, but she didn&#39;t seem to fear him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...May I have the honor of knowing your name, my mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel was speechless as the man spoke to her. So close, she wondered if anyone could look at him and think him a mere werewolf. A god, a blessed messiah of the goddess, or a fallen star: Goddess, he was so handsome! His smile was charming and he wore it with all the confidence of an older man assured of who he was and his ability to get what he wanted. His eyes were a clear blue, looking at her as if he could see to the depths of her heart and loved everything she ever had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breastplate was black leather, stretched over his broad, muscled chest. He was much larger than she thought, and she felt her face heat. The scent of blood was much stronger this close, yet his cloak and pants seemed clean. Blood had stained him so much that it had become a part of his scent it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood why the crowd had seemed to become so quiet when he entered the town. She should be terrified, but she wasn&#39;t trembling in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice was itching to get down and rush to him. Laurel pressed her thighs together as he spoke, embarrassed and thrilled by how rich his voice was, dripping with sensual knowledge and warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was she supposed to speak to him if his voice was enough to make her wet and willing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, yes&#34; She cleared her throat. &#34;I-It&#39;s Laurel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel is a lovely name... I am Adolph Raymond. Please, call me Adolph.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soldiers came after him, &#34;Your Majesty, what--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel&#39;s heart skipped a beat and fear seized her. He stiffened, he must have smelled her apprehension and fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph *Raymond*? The king of the werewolf kingdom? Basil&#39;s *father*? Quickly, the similarities seemed to scream at her. Basil had his father&#39;s hair, but Adolph&#39;s hair was lighter in color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would the goddess do this to her? How could she? Had she not seen how much she had struggled and suffered trying to gain Basil&#39;s affection and failed? Basil wasn&#39;t half the man his father was! What hope did she have to gain his affection? How could her mate be such an unattainable man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart clenched, and she stifled the sob. It seemed as if every dream of meeting her mate and their blissful lives together shattered and fell into a deep canyon in her soul. She had left the Imperial City and the royal family, she had hoped for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did the goddess simply want her to suffer further trying to chase after the king&#39;s affection? Maybe she found Laura&#39;s plight amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice moaned, trying to push through Laurel&#39;s despair, but even her usual optimism wasn&#39;t enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How long would she be dragged back into the den of the nobility of the werewolf kingdom? Would she never be free of the Raymonds?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to leave. She had to escape now before anything else happened before she truly couldn&#39;t escape. She could live a life without her mate, but she had to *live* first. She turned quickly and shrieked as her hand slipped. Gravity took hold and she covered her face, her heart hammering and remembering the river and rocks rushing up to her in her past life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She closed her eyes, yet there was no pain. In place of pain and darkness, there was warmth and the most delicious scent filling her nose. She clung to the warmth, trembling and struggling to breathe around her panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re safe,&#34; Adolph whispered. His voice was warm and comforting. &#34;I have you now. I&#39;ll take you somewhere safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph sunk his hand into her hair and held her close, taking deep breaths of her sweet scent and feeling the bond warm between them. He had never expected his mate to resist him, but he would soothe her fears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re safe,&#34; he said again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel quieted and her breathing slowed. She gasped and didn&#39;t lift her face to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My apologies, Your Majesty, forgive my rudeness.&#34; She turned as if to escape his arms. &#34;My muddy skirt must have soiled your armor and cloak--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is not rude for my mate to do anything to me,&#34; he said. &#34;Are you hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head stiffly and slipped free of him, bowing her head and backing away slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;M-My apologies, Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was accustomed to people bowing, but the sight of her head bowed irked him. She was his *mate*, bestowed upon him by the goddess. A blessing, not a commoner! No matter her status at birth, she was his equal and match in every way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would be his luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me!&#34; Laurel said, turned, and hurried away towards the crow.  Adolph turned his horse, his heart clenching as she hurried through the crowd towards a side road that led out of Silver Blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait!&#34; Adolph called, sliding off his horse to follow her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The townspeople gasped and murmured, but parted for him allowing him to catch up to her quickly as she exited the town. He heard the sound of his unit and his horse following him, but he couldn&#39;t heed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel skidded to a halt at the crossroads leading out of Silver Blade and curses. Her eyes were burning with tears.  The sign&#39;s lettering had been worn away with time. Neither path was familiar to her, and she was certain they had come into town down a different path. Her heart raced as she tried to decide which way to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she could find Amanda?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait!&#34; Adolph called again as a group of men on horses shot past him and cut off her path. She stumbled back from them, hands trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;P-Please, I&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph reached her, taking her hand gently, barely holding it as if not to frighten her as he lifted it and pulled her closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel, you need not fear me or my men,&#34; he pulled her ever closer, filling her senses with his scent. &#34;What pack are you from? I can escort you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel lowered her head. What choice did she have? She couldn&#39;t offend him any more than she likely already had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S-Sapphire Lake, Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, call me Adolph. I know the way,&#34; his horse trotted to him with a neigh and he stroked his flank, offering her his hand. &#34;Let me help you up, my mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel shook her head, &#34;I-I would rather walk,  and y-you could just tell me the way&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph waved his hand and his horse fell in line with one of the knights as he stepped closer and offered her his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would never allow my mate to walk alone on such an unsafe road.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel hung her head and eventually wrapped her arm with his. The knight moved to border the right-hand path and Adolph led her forward, slowing his gait to accommodate her shorter stride. Laurel hoped they could simply pass the walk in silence as quickly as possible, but she could feel his gaze on her. She tried to focus on the shifting scenery</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-Is there something on my face, Your Majesty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft flush appeared on his cheeks and he shook his head, &#34;No. Forgive me You did not give me your full name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Laurel Miller.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped as one of the knights gasped. Adolph&#39;s brow furrowed as he looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;... Do you know Jack Miller?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, &#34;Yes! He&#39;s my father. You know him?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze turned solemn and the knights seemed uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My apologies, Laurel... He was a brave man and a great warrior.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel felt her insides turn cold and her body froze with trepidation. It couldn&#39;t be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...w-was, Your Majesty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was killed by a vampire two weeks ago.&#34;</p>
