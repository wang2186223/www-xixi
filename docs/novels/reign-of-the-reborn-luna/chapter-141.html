                <p>The ride was quiet. Basil was slumped against the door, painfully sober and refusing to look at anyone in the carriage. To Laurel&#39;s knowledge, he hadn&#39;t wanted to come back to be with Delia to escort her to the estate, but Adolph ordered him to return on principle. Despite their appearances, they were still married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a bit sad and embarrassing for them in Laurel&#39;s mind. Basil knew she had been Laura in her past life. To have thrown her out based on his undeniable love for Delia then not being able to even look at her had to be adding to his guilt and regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even feel smug about it, just almost feeling sorry for him as if he were a stranger that had been splattered with dirty street water at the passing of a carriage. Delia was tense and looking out the other window. The commotion with her parents had taken all the usual bite out of her it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel wondered if they had spoken about her past and that was adding to the tension between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hadn&#39;t taken long for Laurel to regret the suggestion that they all ride together. She glanced at Adolph who seemed to be agreeing with her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*They don&#39;t look like newlyweds* Laurel said, *What do you think happened?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>* I get the sense that Basil is realizing that his wolf has more of a part to play in his happiness than he first thought. Growing pains, darling. They were long overdue.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel frowned, rubbing her stomach thoughtfully. Basil flinched, glancing at her from the corner of his eye before seeming to sink further into himself. Delia&#39;s jaw clenched just enough to be noticeable and the oddly hostile energy in the carriage seemed to grow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph took her hand, &#34;It is a long ride to the Mirabelle estate, perhaps you should rest, Laurel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel hummed, leaning against him with a little smile, &#34;Okay but promise me a snack when I wake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph laughed, &#34;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something for you in the massive basket Maria packed for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded, dozing off against Adolph&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Laurel&#39;s breathing evened out, Adolph guided her to lay her head in his lap as she slept undisturbed by the atmosphere in the carriage. He stroked her hair gently, watching the scenery go by as they rode towards the Mirabelle estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was grateful to have Laurel spared from this awkward atmosphere and occupied his mind with the future. Another child. More lands. The Wiccans. Eden&#39;s status. Pondering the new state of his life was enough to distract him for the entire ride to the Mirabelle estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the carriage stopped, Laurel stirred and he chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You slept the entire ride,&#34; Adolph said as the door opened. Basil shot out of the door as if he had been chased out. A different hand reached in to help Delia out of the carriage as Laurel sat up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel pouted, blinking at him blearily, &#34;... hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, &#34;Of course. Come on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exited the carriage and lifted her out after him. Sam appeared carrying the basked Maria packed for them. He thanked Sam and led Laurel towards the manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was much different than he remembered, though he had only been there once before. Gavin had been using his ill-gotten funds to expand and renovate the manor. It would be a nice asset for Basil when Gavin inevitably exposed his part to play in all of the machinations against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel looked up at the edifice of the manor and felt her heart constricting. She had only ever gone to the Mirabelle estate a few times in the past and it had never been an enjoyable experience. The sight of the renovated manor only made her more furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Upset?* Adolph asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Furious How much money had he wasted for his vanity?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*More than either of us can ever know, but no harm in making him spend a little more to cover his tracks, hm?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was true, but Gavin&#39;s hold on the former ministers wasn&#39;t one of just one money. There were secrets between them and Gavin held their strings for so long that it was more likely that they would be bankrupting the few that still had money to spare than damaging Gavin enough to eliminate him as a threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome to the Mirabelle Estate!&#34; The head of the household greeted from the top of the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recognized him as Tina&#39;s brother. Tina was the older of the two, but she remembered him being much meaner. His eyes narrowed at her sharply before darting to Adolph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Greetings, Your Majesty.&#34; He bowed as they approached. &#34;It is my honor to be attending to your needs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph eyed him, &#34;It would please me greatly if you would not and send someone else to attend to me and my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush of warmth went through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if you feel the need to look at your queen and luna with such disrespect again, you will see your sister sooner rather than later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin flinched as the man went pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Rheta?&#34; Adolph asked, &#34;I remember her being far more agreeable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered Rheta as well and a bit of relief went through her at the thought. Rheta had been the only woman among the staff who had any respect for her. She was also incredibly nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rheta is no longer a servant,&#34; Gavin said primly. &#34;She has been assigned to the stables.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph glared at him, &#34;Then promote her back to her station and send her to our chamber.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph led Laurel past the old man and into the manor. Basil was already gone leaving Delia to look around on her own. Adolph shook his head and looked at Gavin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this how you have ensured my son&#39;s education?&#34; Adolph asked, gesturing to Delia. &#34;To leave his wife like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Er, well. I imagine-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find him and bring him back here,&#34; Adolph said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel smiled up at him. Amazed by his attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you&#39;ll indulge me in this small moment. Apparently, my years of parenting Basil have only just begun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel chuckled, &#34;I do not believe I will faint from hunger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can send you ahead with Sam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, &#34;I am curious as to what sort of father you are&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph&#39;s lips twitched as Delia looked uncomfortable. He looked at Delia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;While I do not usually get involved with the marriages of others, he is my son and this is not how I would have ever expected him to behave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia didn&#39;t look at him but nodded shakily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant returned with Basil who looked near queasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Son,&#34; Adolph said, &#34;What show of manners is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not interrupt me,&#34; Adolph cut in. &#34;Do not try to explain away your utter disregard for your wife and mate. After proclaiming her to be the love of your life, your mate, and marrying her in the way that you have, you would leave her in the foyer of your grandfather&#39;s house as if she is nothing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil looked down, not ashamed but he acknowledged the admonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No matter where she came from, you decided to take her as your wife, accepting her as she is.&#34; Adolph said, &#34;Remember that, and act accordingly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil glanced at him before glancing at Laurel who met his gaze. They looked at one another and she could see something in his eyes, struggling to speak though he said nothing as he lowered his gaze again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand, father.&#34; He turned, refusing to look at Delia, &#34;This way Delia I&#39;ll show you to your rooms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia followed him down the hallway, barely taking a glance back at Adolph and Laurel as he led her on. They reached a side of the estate that seemed freshly cleaned but hardly used. Basil opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And where will you be staying?&#34; Delia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil&#39;s eye twitched as he glared at her, &#34;How is that any concern of yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard your father. I&#39;m your wife!&#34; Delia huffed, her eyes burning as he glared at her. &#34;I know my parents were-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care about that,&#34; Basil scoffed. &#34;I figured you had someone back there and they would probably show up again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia&#39;s eyes widened, &#34;You thought so. Then this is about Laura? You said you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know what I said!&#34; Basil hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you haven&#39;t even bothered to see me. We haven&#39;t spent one night together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at her, &#34;As I recall, it was your decision first. Upset that I rejected you so long into the marriage? Perhaps you should have thought of that before!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia stared at him wide-eyed as Basil went on, seething and she winced at hearing her actions leading up to his divorce thrown in her face. She had tempted and teased, keeping him just at arm&#39;s length while he was still married, feigning concern about Laura, and when he divorced her finally, she had played at being shy, taking advantage of his enraptured state to not call her on her hypocrisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil scoffed, turning his head, &#34;No. That&#39;s not right. Feeling as I do now, as I have been feeling for weeks, I doubted I would have slept with you anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia flushed, offended and angry. She was a beautiful woman. What man wouldn&#39;t want to sleep with her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is about Laura. I knew it! You-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it is.&#34;</p>
