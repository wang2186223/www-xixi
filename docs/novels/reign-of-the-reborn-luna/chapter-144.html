                <p>Laurel&#39;s heart lurched. The fever was still in her blood from Adolph&#39;s indulgence and the hot flash, but she had to get out of the tub. Her legs slipped out from under her and she huffed. They were still trembling and she glowered down at them with a huff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would scold Adolph properly for making her legs jelly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long will it take for them to arrive?&#34; Adolph asked beyond the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A week perhaps? Sir Chasel wasn&#39;t clear on that, but he wanted to know what he should do should they return before you have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;... detain them. If they are resistant to turning over Eden, detain them violently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Your Majesty. Is there any other message I should convey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If they arrive before we have returned, send word by carrier bird.&#34;</p>

                <p>The door opened and closed again before Adolph came back into the bathroom. She glowered at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suppose you heard that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, and my legs don&#39;t work!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned, &#34;I am glad to be fulfilling my marital duty perhaps later you can fulfill yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adolph&#34; she groaned, her face burning with embarrassment. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged, &#34;You married an older man, my love. That comes with a lack of shame. Stay in the tub. You look overheated. I have to speak with Basil. Perhaps I will send him back and spare him his unfortunate marital situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel laughed and huffed. He winked at her and left her alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia was barely pulling herself together when a knock sounded on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flinched and calmed her voice, &#34;Who is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Delia? Minister Mirabelle wishes to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia growled and whirled to look at herself in the mirror. She didn&#39;t look terrible, if a bit pale. She patted her cheeks trying to get some color back into them, before turning and going to the door. She opened the door and gave Gavin her most polite smile. He smiled, but his eyes seemed to be assessing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Minister Mirabelle,&#34; Delia said, &#34;What brought you to see me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such formality! You are family now, please, call me Gavin at least. I thought it would be a good time to have a bit of your time as Basil seems to be under the weather.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia&#39;s heart clenched and she nodded, &#34;He did seem out of it. Of course, please come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin turned back, &#34;Bring us a full spread for tea, hm? I&#39;m sure the young woman is hungry from her travels.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant left and she led him to the small parlor and sat. Gavin said nothing until the servants came back with the food and tea. When the door closed, his face lost its humor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Delia,&#34; Gavin said, &#34;You are in a precarious position, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at him blankly, &#34;What is it that you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not Basil&#39;s mate,&#34; Gavin said bluntly. He smiled, &#34;How you&#39;ve managed to make him think you are, I can only imagine has more to do with your beauty and other skills, than any genuine connection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia forced herself to frown in confusion though her heart was racing. She was lucky, of course, that Gavin was old enough that his senses had diminished and he was not an alpha werewolf. If this was Adolph she was facing, it would be a very different story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gavin why would you say such a hateful thing to me?&#34; Delia asked, looking away and allowing her eyes to gloss over with tears. &#34;I know that I am not as well-versed in the political needs of the nation, but I am trying. If you hate me so much, though we have never spoken much, why don&#39;t you speak to Basil about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No mated pair would act the way you two do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me, Gavin, but as I recall you have never been mated. What would you know about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin flinched, shocked as she looked down at her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basil and I are struggling, yes, but I believe it is because he is simply starting to grieve Laura. They were married for three years after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His Majesty and his new wife are certainly a mated pair yet you do not even seem to have a remotely similar interaction with my grandson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every mated pair must find their way,&#34; Delia lifted a shoulder delicately. &#34;We met at such an emotional time in my life and we have hardly had a moment&#39;s reprieve since then. Our issues will work themselves out in time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why then did he put you over here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia frowned, &#34;What makes you think that he put me over here and I did not request some distance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin frowned, &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Though it is painful to be apart from him, it is for the best while he deals with his grief. He isn&#39;t drinking anymore so his mood swings are a bit frightening.&#34; She swallowed, digging deep. &#34;IBefore I came to the castle, my life was mired in violence. Seeing him like that frightens me. Hence, I am over here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin eyed her, unable to sense any lie in her words, but he knew what he saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My grandson has rogue light sparking in his eyes. How do you explain that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His Majesty had the same,&#34; Delia said. &#34;Isn&#39;t that just a sign of how powerful they are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin hummed, &#34;He is convinced that Laurel is Laura.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia gave him a sympathetic look, &#34;Yes he said as much to me. He regrets banishing her the way he did. Acting so rashly ultimately cost her life, though indirectly. I think it&#39;s part of why he&#39;s suffering so much. He was under a lot of pressure with the constant fear that his father would end up dead. He didn&#39;t feel prepared to take the throne of His Majesty were to die in battle&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went on, weaving an inner view of Basil that would make her seem closer to him than they actually were. If she was right, Gavin wouldn&#39;t think twice about it as he wasn&#39;t close enough to Basil to know the difference anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Gavin said nothing, turning over her words as she made a show of pulling herself together and wiping her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, Lady Delia,&#34; Gavin began, &#34;That is all well and good, but there is one thing that you&#39;ve forgotten in your little act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia frowned, &#34;What&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s told me he plans to divorce you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia blinked and she let out a startled laugh. The man&#39;s face was superior, a picture of feigned non-interest, but he was as plain as an open book. That at least was a lie. His entire demeanor had changed when she let out a startled laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gavin, I don&#39;t know what I did to make you dislike me so much I understand that you don&#39;t like our luna, Laurel, and the time we spend together may seem suspicious to you, but I think you might come to like her more if you spent some time with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin&#39;s lips twitched and his eyes narrowed as he flushed. Delia felt the conversation turning and gave a little pout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you loved your daughter. I&#39;m sure you love her still. It&#39;s probably very hard to see another woman in her position, especially when she was taken from you so abruptly, but aren&#39;t there better ways to deal with your grief than attempting to drive a wedge between Basil and me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is actually why I came to speak to you,&#34; Gavin said, sipping his tea. &#34;Why is it that you and Laurel spend so much time together? You are being trained by Lady Helena are you not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia giggled, &#34;It is odd for you to be so interested in what young women talk about, Gavin. I assure you that I protect your grandson&#39;s modesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cheeks darkened, &#34;As far as I am concerned, you are a suspicious, unknown entity we have allowed into our midst.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and the former ministers,&#34; Delia said with a steady gaze, &#34;By virtue of not educating the heir about his position, you have allowed us to finally meet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*And for that grandfather, I will never forgive you.* *Gavin&#39;s stomach turned as he met Delia&#39;s gaze.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And for that, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.&#34; Her gaze turned cold and mocking. &#34;I hope you will treat our future children with more care, though I imagine their grandfather will keep a much closer eye on them as he is back in the castle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin&#39;s eyes widened and he set his cup down. Before he could speak, a knock sounded on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please come in,&#34; Delia called, sipping her tea. The door opened with a servant&#39;s entrance. She bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive the intrusion, Minister Mirabelle. A message has arrived from the capital and His Majesty has asked that you be told.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin stood, &#34;We will have to continue our conversation another time, Delia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, Gavin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left with a clenched jaw. Delia was a more difficult woman than he had ever thought and too smart for her good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What happened to the standard of woman Olivia had lived up to: simple, obedient, and fanciful? Delia had issued a subtle warning and Gavin would have to find a way around it to force her to comply with his plan.</p>
