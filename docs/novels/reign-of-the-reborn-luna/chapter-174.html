                <p>His stomach churned but he nodded, walking into the room. Fear filled him, but as he entered the room he started to relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so beautiful you take after your father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel lay among the sheets, dressed in a loose gown and cradling the baby to her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the distance, he could only see a tuft of honey blonde hair in the swaddling blanket. The wetnurses bowed and stepped aside as he approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel smiled up at him, &#34;Want to meet him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel beamed at him, &#34;Him Nimue told me before, but I wanted it to still be a surprise for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another boy. Adolph sunk onto the bed beside her, kissing her cheek before looking down into her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had Laurel&#39;s nose and hair pattern though the coloring was all his. Maybe when he grew up he&#39;d take after his grandfathers, but he wouldn&#39;t be able to tell that for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I hold him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded, offering the child to him. He smelled like fresh water and clean skin as Adolph took him, and held him close. He was so small and fragile, his heart clenched with tenderness and he offered the child one of his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, little Jack,&#34; Laurel gasped. &#34;The man you&#39;re named after died saving your father&#39;s life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack turned slightly, wrapping his tiny hand around Adolph&#39;s finger as he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, his eyes fluttered open, and brilliant green eyes looked up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t think there was a moment in his life he&#39;d felt so full of love. His eyes burned with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Six months later</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel laughed as Nimue the door behind her and slumped against the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am too old for all of this foolishness!&#34; Nimue cried. &#34;Honestly, why are your clothes so uncomfortable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel laughed, &#34;It can&#39;t be that bad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Corsets are a werewolf thing,&#34; Nimue said. &#34;And Raven is a conniving woman with more cunning in her fingernail than I have time to evade for long periods.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel chuckled, gesturing to her couch, &#34;You&#39;re welcome to hide here for now. I&#39;m working on some plans for the city anyway. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally, something that has nothing to do with the wedding.&#34; Nimue said, &#34;The way I hear it, he&#39;s been married twice already and both of them died. It feels like bad luck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel chuckled, not even flinching at the memory and longer, &#34;They were different people with different circumstances. You&#39;re his actual mate, Nimue. If Basil doesn&#39;t kill them, Adolph will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nimue chuckled, &#34;And if not him, then Eden or my uncle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nimue sighed, &#34;Does there need to be an engagement party and a wedding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Laurel said, laughing. A knock sounded on the door and Nimue groaned. &#34;Come in!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily entered, carrying Jack in her arms. He let out an excited shriek and Nimue jumped to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby time!&#34; Nimue yelled, &#34;Finally, someone who doesn&#39;t care about how many roses or lunar flowers there are so long as he can put something in his mouth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily laughed letting her take Jack from her arms, &#34;Prince Basil has been searching for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not here,&#34; Nimue said. &#34;You haven&#39;t seen me. He&#39;ll drive me crazy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel chuckled, &#34;Why is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nimue rubbed noses with Jack as he let out a shriek of glee. She conjured a swirl of healing lights for his entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He keeps trying to ask me about how uncle and Eden will react when they get here,&#34; Nimue said. &#34;What&#39;s the fun in meeting the family if I walk him through it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seems a bit cruel considering your cousin can conjure lightning,&#34; Lily said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nimue shrugged, &#34;He proposed. His consequences to bear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel had been surprised that he&#39;d proposed. More surprised that Nimue had accepted. She would have never guessed that a woman like Nimue would have been Basil&#39;s mate, but it made a lot of sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil was high-strung, bratty, and naïve, but she brought out an earnest side that made his inexperience almost endearing. Nimue was anything but high-strung and knew more about the world than many would ever know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speaking with her sometimes felt like speaking with someone her age and an elder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least, when she wasn&#39;t giving sex tips. Laurel&#39;s face burned. Listening to Nimue give pointers on how to pleasure Adolph with her mouth had left her as red as a rose for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she&#39;d used those tips, she&#39;d ended up in bed for several days after. Nimue had winked at her with a knowing smile, and Laurel had done her best to avoid sex conversations from then on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had ended a few days ago, right after Jack had begun sleeping through the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel stacked her papers together and set them aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, it&#39;s almost lunchtime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Nimue moaned, &#34;Then, I&#39;ll have to share Jack&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel laughed, &#34;I&#39;m his mother and I barely get time to hold him. You&#39;ll live.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nimue sighed, cradling Jack gently as they headed towards the family dining room. Henry was in the doorway, and in a flash, he scooped Jack out of Nimue&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got the baby!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A resounding cheer went through the room and Laurel shook her head listening to the excited chatter. Adolph and Basil were missing from the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s the soon-to-be groom and my husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven smirked, &#34;We all know you only care about my brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel shrugged, &#34;No comment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They should be here soon,&#34; Henry said, bouncing Jack gently. &#34;There was a mock battle and things got dirty due to the rain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could only imagine. The thought of Adolph slipping and sliding around in the mud made her smile a bit. Then, she thought of him getting in the shower and the taste of water on his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! No dirty thoughts at lunch!&#34; Irene cackled. &#34;Goodness, you were just released from your chambers two days ago!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d be happy to take you back to bed after we&#39;ve been diplomatic in-laws,&#34; Adolph said from behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel turned and gave him a meaningful look, &#34;Adolph, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned and pressed a kiss to her lips, &#34;I love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, &#34;I love you too Even if you are trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked into the room, &#34;Is there a chance I will get to hold my son at least once today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil came down the hallway, adjusting his tie a bit nervously as Henry began to bargain about how long Adolph would repossess Jack for. Basil turned to the mirror in the hallway to check his reflection as Nimue came out of the room and took his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re too tense,&#34; she pulled him down the hallway. &#34;Goodness, you act like he&#39;s going to eat you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nimue, you can&#39;t mess up my clothes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not all I&#39;ll be messing up, darling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel suppressed a giggle as they disappeared down the hallway and Basil&#39;s stammering protests faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel approached from the direction they were going with an amused smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The happy couple seem to be as happy as ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel chuckled, &#34;Well, hopefully, her family knows her well enough not to be offended.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speaking of, the carriages will be arriving soon. I imagine you will be receiving them personally?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded, &#34;Adolph?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m coming,&#34; Adolph replied coming out of the room with a sigh. &#34;Eventually, we&#39;ll have some time with our son. At this rate, he&#39;s not going to know who his actual parents are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s a smart baby,&#34; Laurel said, &#34;He&#39;ll be calling you Dad in no time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph nodded and kissed her cheek, &#34;Shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll make sure their bags and things are taken care of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded, following Chasel down the hall towards the front gates and to the steps of the palace. How long had it been since she&#39;d stood on these steps with fear making her heart pound? She leaned into Adolph&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph squeezed her hand, &#34;I was thinking that there are some things that I haven&#39;t shown you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like how talented my mouth is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped and felt her cheeks burning. Before she could speak, the caravan pulled up and he descended the stairs to greet them. Eden was sat astride horseback, dressed in Wiccan robes under a black vest. He dismounted with a bright smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hear we&#39;ll be family soon,&#34; Eden said, laughing as he shook hands with Adolph. &#34;I feel bad for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin got out of the carriage with a shake of his head, &#34;She couldn&#39;t even be here to greet us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know how she is,&#34; Eden said. &#34;She&#39;ll probably, at least, be at lunch maybe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at them as Taliesin and Eden looked up at the castle with a critical eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Laurel asked, looking up at the edifice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you about the story behind Crystal Castle,&#34; Taliesin said, &#34;The protections look like they&#39;re filling out. I guess she is doing some work even if she&#39;s trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that a good thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden grinned at her, &#34;It means lasting peace and the thrones of the moon and sun are finally as they should have been.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled up at the edifice of the castle as Adolph slipped his hand into hers and squeezed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go enjoy our well-earned, peace, hm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel grinned up at him and nodded, &#34;Let&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The End</p>
