                <p>After brunch, they retired to the bridal suite. Delia sat at the back of the room, refusing to help Laurel, though it didn&#39;t seem as though she was expected to help. It didn&#39;t matter to her other than to irritate her. There should have been news about Adolph being ill by now, but since there wasn&#39;t, she could only imagine that Adolph would fall to the poison before the ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d used the entire vial after all. She didn&#39;t know what Tina was planning, but she doubted that Laurel would make it long after the ceremony either. With both of them out of the way, she would be the luna. Basil would be king, but the entire plan would be complete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would Eden be happy? Would he reward her? She grimaced, thinking of Tina. There was no way the woman wouldn&#39;t remember her hint about Basil&#39;s heir. Maybe she should have saved a bit of poison for her as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven watched Delia out of the corner of the mirror as she helped Irene do Laurel&#39;s makeup. Lily and Sarah managed the curling of Laurel&#39;s hair while Irene and the others prepared her gown and veil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t I see it now?&#34; Laurel asked with a little pout. &#34;I&#39;m going to be wearing it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indulge me?&#34; Raven chuckled. &#34;It&#39;s not a tradition, but it should be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel sighed but agreed, enjoying having them fuss over her. When Laura had gotten married, Sarah had been the only person to help her. Her parents had been too busy mingling with the nobles to see their daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In hindsight, she had barely noticed because she was so excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All done!&#34; Raven said, stepping back. &#34;Close those eyes and we&#39;ll get you in your gown!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel smiled and closed her eyes before reaching out. Someone helped her stand and step up into her gown and up onto the tailor&#39;s stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven chuckled as Laurel allowed them to adjust the ties of the dress and arrange the skirt and veil as required. Her eyes burned a little as Lily brought the box Adolph had sent ahead for Laurel. She opened it and hummed. Irene let out a low whistle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s polished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven scoffed, &#34;If there was one thing we can trust His Majesty to do it is to cover all the details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted the circlet of twining gold leaves, rubies, diamonds, and emeralds out of the box and hooked the veil onto it. Sarah let out a little gasp of awe while Lily wiped her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Almost there,&#34; Raven told Laurel and set the circlet on her head. She stepped back to admire the vision Laurel was in her gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think there will ever be a more beautiful bride,&#34; Aria said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on and open your eyes, dear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel opened her eyes and met her gaze in the mirror. She gasped seeing the young woman in the mirror. The gown was beautiful. Gold and silver leaves trailed along her bodice and over the skirt of her dress that was cut close to her hips, accentuating her curves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, she saw Laura standing beside her smiling and teary at her. The Laura in the mirror nodded at her before flashing a winning smile and walking away. Her black hair swayed in an invisible wind and she vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel felt her knees go a bit weak and she felt a little dizzy, but it passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel looked at Raven, &#34;Thank you for everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven grinned, &#34;Just make sure you keep His Majesty out of too much trouble and we&#39;ll call it even.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel laughed, &#34;I&#39;ll do my best!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph stood in front of the mirror, fixing his tie. Basil sat quietly nearby while Henry, Liam, and Dorian were chatting, teasing him as they pleased. Chasel smiled at him through the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It warms my heart to see you so happy,&#34; Chasel said with a grin. &#34;I&#39;m sure the men are just as happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph scoffed, &#34;While I&#39;m on my honeymoon, I expected you to keep them up to standard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel chuckled, &#34;If you have the time to think about the men training while on your honeymoon, Your Majesty, you need another mode of instruction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry and Dorian cackled as Adolph gave him a wolfish grin through the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil looked between them, feeling out of place. He had never seen his father so happy, fixing his tie and shrugging into his ceremonial jacket trimmed with red azaleas and gold. He ran a hand through his hair and turned from the mirror to look at Basil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it, son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil swallowed, looking at him. What was there to say? How could he protest his father&#39;s happiness after everything he&#39;d learned and all the things he suspected? What did he know about choosing a wife? He was beginning to wonder if he knew anything about choosing a mate either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, father,&#34; Basil said, solemnly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph&#39;s smile turned warm, and he clapped a hand on his shoulder, &#34;Have a drink with your father, hm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil&#39;s eyes glistened as he looked up at him and nodded, shakily, getting to his feet to follow him to the bar where Henry had already set out a circle of glasses of whiskey. Chasel joined them at the table and Henry lifted his glass high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To happiness!&#34; Henry cheered. &#34;And beautiful women!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph laughed as they clinked their glasses together and he glanced at Chasel with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, when are you going to get married Chasel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As soon as I can stop worrying about you,&#34; Chasel quipped earning a peal of laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock sounded on the door announcing that the ceremony was going to start soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They finished their drinks and headed out of the room. Henry and Dorian were singing an old army song about returning from war to the arms of a lover. Basil had never heard it, but every knight they passed joined in with warm smiles as they saluted the group as they passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he&#39;d married Laura, he hadn&#39;t had anyone to toast with before the ceremony. Even his marriage to Delia had been without anyone to join in his joy. He had never imagined being able to walk down the corridors of the castle with his terrifying father and his relatives in such a mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Mirabelle men were known for calm reserve and elitism. He loved his grandfather, but he couldn&#39;t help but wonder what it would have been like to grow up among the extended Raymond family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They reached the great hall to the rhythmic thud of spears on the ground and fists on shields, welcoming and announcing Adolph&#39;s arrival at the hall. His grandfather and his great uncle stood with the ministers looking dour as they entered, but Basil doubted it was because Adolph refused to have them in his dressing room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found a place among the crowd as Adolph walked to the altar to stand with the priestess Basil suspected was another relative. Soon, Delia came to stand with him from the entrance of the hall. He saw Irene and several other women. Lily and Sarah stepped aside to stand at Sam and Lynn&#39;s sides near the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then there was Raven, leading Laurel into the hall. He was breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph&#39;s stomach fluttered with joy and it took everything in him to wait until she walked to him. She seemed paler than usual, but the lush red of the roses and azaleas in her bouquet made her white gown seem to glow like moonlight. The traces of gold through her veil and twined with rubies, emeralds, and diamonds around her temple seemed to glow, calling to him and lovely. She was a vision come to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to tell her that, but he couldn&#39;t find the words, barely able to breathe around his awe. His wolf watched her with an apt fascination as she walked towards him. His heart clenched at the bouquet in her hands, all twenty-seven blooms were there as if she was walking out of the history of his family and the werewolf kingdom. Raven had outdone herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled sweetly as she reached him. He bowed and offered her his hand. Her fingers were cold and trembling as she placed her hand in his. Adolph pulled her closer to stand on the platform with him. The priestess&#39; voice was warm and gentle as she recited the oaths they were meant to take.  He listened with half an ear as he looked at Laurel, looking forward to their future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel smiled up at him even though the world was rocking around her. She felt nauseous, but she focused on the happiness in her heart. Alice grew still and quiet as if she were falling asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do,&#34; Adolph said, bringing her out of the shifting shadows that were taking over her vision. Her chest grew tighter as she squeezed the bouquet in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just had to hold until it was her turn to agree. She just had to hold on and then she could find somewhere to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you swear before the moon goddess and all present to bear the burden of duty as mate, luna, and queen to His Majesty, King Adolph Raymond?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph&#39;s smile was stained red. His eyes widened in horror as she felt the pain in her chest explode as she choked. The scent of blood, metallic and bitter, filled her nose and the shadows swarmed, pulling her into darkness as someone screamed and the bouquet slipped from her hands.</p>
