                <p>Laurel and Adolph came down for a formal breakfast just before Raven, Henry, and the rest. Basil and Delia were already inside the formal dining room. It was unnerving to have so many people at the table now, but a glance at Basil told her that he wasn&#39;t uncomfortable if a bit timid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The food was served by a small team of servants and taste-tested in front of them before they began to eat. As always the food was delicious, but it was hard to focus on it with them talking so much. The cold older women who had come to the castle as lunas of nearby noble packs had been replaced with women laughing happily with each other, teasing and chatting amicably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were so sickeningly happy that Delia had to tune them out. She&#39;d had sisters once, but they had never been like this. She knew that Raven was Adolph&#39;s sister, but she didn&#39;t know the exact familial relationships between the others and she didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She supposed living at the top of society meant that people could be happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;... Delia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up to the person calling her name and found it was Laurel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said we&#39;ll be headed to the orphanage after your lesson with Lady Helena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia pressed her lips together. Angry and unable to say anything about it as Adolph piped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basil,&#34; Adolph said. Basil straightened in his chair and it took every bit of cunning in her to keep from rolling her eyes. &#34;Since you&#39;re not needed to repair the temple, I thought you might like to join me today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh?&#34; Basil said, his voice growing hopeful. &#34;Yes. Yes, of course, father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven and Laurel shared an amused look across the table before bursting into a little laugh. Raven was glad that Laurel seemed to understand more about Basil than his mate did. It would help manage him and get him free of Gavin&#39;s machinations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, Delia went to her lesson. When that was finally over, Laurel arrived to take her into the city. If there was a greater waste of time, Delia wasn&#39;t sure what it would be. She hated children, but to remain under the radar and bide her time before trying to figure out a way out of this situation, she followed Laurel out of the castle with their escort to the school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t been listening to Laurel when she told Delia what she was supposed to be doing, too angry at the thought of being around a bunch of orphans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if she needed that reminder thrown in her face. Where these kids were orphans due to war, she had lost her parents to their selfishness and foolishness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humans were weaker than werewolves, of course, but they were more numerous. She shuddered remembering the angry mob that had stood against her parents and their comrades who had wanted to hustle the human village for protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d run, leaving them to their fates, and made her way through the neutral zone towards the vampire lands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Delia,&#34; Laurel said and pointed towards the desk where another woman was sitting, gathering papers. &#34;You&#39;ll be helping get the kids registered and assigned to rooms in the orphanage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia rolled her eyes but crossed the room and sat beside the woman. The woman was cheery, clearly loving the waves of children that were coming by escort from a small caravan. Delia did her best not to be bothered by the sight of them looking at her like she should care about them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel came back about an hour after leaving her, &#34;A heads up that there should be adults coming soon to register for the school. Teenagers too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What for?&#34; Delia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The basic requirement to join the military, become government officials, a merchant, or even work in the castle is literacy,&#34; Laurel explained. &#34;They have to pass a written test.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t known that, but the thought made her furious. Why such a hard line? What was so important about being able to read and write. Sure, being able to read, as bad as she could, making it easier to get through Helena&#39;s classes, but writing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the woman beside her as she fumbled and slid parchment to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;ll certainly need the help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can do it,&#34; Delia said, crossing her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman looked stunned, &#34;But&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia gave her a cold look and she took the parchment back, leaning back in her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel watched the exchange curiously before approaching. She took the parchment and a quill from the woman&#39;s side and placed them in front of Delia. Delia looked up at her with a furious and resentful stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re here to work,&#34; Laurel said, &#34;If you can&#39;t do the job, I&#39;ll find you something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia narrowed her eyes and stood, &#34;Then you should get to that, *Laurel*.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman gasped and Laurel searched Delia&#39;s gaze before she realized something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Delia&#34; she said. &#34;Do you not know how to write?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia narrowed her eyes at her and that was answer enough. Then, the doors opened. She called another person to help man the desk before leading Delia away to an empty classroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had she not thought of that? She had thought that Delia had simply been slacking off and was reluctant to follow Lady Helena&#39;s orders. It had never crossed her mind to think that Delia couldn&#39;t write, let alone read with any sort of proficiency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How long had she been a rogue? Since she was very young, Laurel assumed. If the ministers had treated Delia the way they&#39;d treated Laura, everyone would have known and she would have been being properly educated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia may have been doted on, but no one had been doing her any sort of favor keeping her so ignorant. More of Delia&#39;s behaviors made sense. No one would have explained the payment documents she brought to the treasury because they were self-explanatory if one could read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My apologies, Delia.&#34; The woman seemed stunned. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to inadvertently embarrass you or expose such a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia blinked and glared at her, &#34;And?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it&#39;s obvious, isn&#39;t it?&#34; She smiled in what she hoped was a kind manner. She didn&#39;t like Delia, but as luna, she had a duty to make sure Delia was educated. Maybe if she was fully literate, it would help Delia feel more at ease in the castle and make her take more interest in behaving appropriately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m more than willing to teach you how to write and help you with your readings&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia clenched her jaw, wanting to tell Laurel to mind her business, but she held her tongue. The werewolves who had been captured during the attack on the wedding and the battle on the border could identify her at any time. Let alone the vampires who had been captured. She didn&#39;t know if they knew her or not, but it was in her best interest to try and garner some sort of rapport with Laurel until she knew she was safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;... fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel was surprised that she agreed so easily, but she pushed forward to set up a good time for them to meet up for lessons before she sent Delia to help in the kitchens. She doubted that Delia had resolved to change her behavior completely, but it was a step in the right direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty.&#34; She turned to look at the guard from the castle. Her heart lurched. &#34;His Majesty has asked for your presence during a meeting in an hour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded, feeling a bit relieved. She spoke to the head of the orphanage and the school about her departure before letting Delia know that she would have to return to the castle alone before following the guard, Sam, and Lynn back to the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard led them to the usual meeting room and she entered curiously. There were a lot of things that they could have to speak about, but she had a feeling it would be about Eden and the remnants of the vampire nation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph stood and rounded the table to greet her at the door. The rest of the room stood in acknowledgment. She was surprised to find Basil able to stand on his own, but his gaze was boring into her across the room. She ignored him as Adolph kissed her hand with a sweet smile and thanked the guard for retrieving her. Her heart fluttered a bit as he escorted her to her seat at his side at the head of the table. Raven gave her a little smile and Irene wiggled her eyebrows at her in knowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel tried not to be embarrassed as their voices flitted through her mind about Raven and Adolph&#39;s father charming their mother to the ends of the kingdom and back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph ushered her to her seat and pushed her up to the table before retaking his seat. The doors were closed as he looked around the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that things have calmed a bit,&#34; Adolph said. &#34;I am interested to know your thoughts on what to do about the vampire nation&#39;s lands now that Morrigan is dead.&#34;</p>
