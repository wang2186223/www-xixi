                <p>The silence was deafening. Laurel wasn&#39;t sure if she could handle hearing anymore. It wasn&#39;t even a part of Morrigan&#39;s plan, but Delia&#39;s jealousy and hastiness? Her death had served no purpose other than satisfying Delia&#39;s ambition?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t allowed herself to think about who had killed her, but she&#39;d had plenty of ideas about why. They revolved around the kingdom&#39;s stability and Basil&#39;s incompetence. When Eden had her kidnapped, she had wondered if he knew why Laura had died, yet his answer as he lay in her arms had been honest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morrigan hadn&#39;t even seen her as an obstacle to getting Delia married to Basil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could anyone be so cruel? She wondered, staring at a loss at Delia. Adolph squeezed her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So why attempt to kill me?&#34; Laurel asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia glared at her, &#34;You&#39;re just as much in the way as she was. What else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia growled, turning her head and glaring at Eden, &#34;Stop making me say things!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden lifted an eyebrow, &#34;I didn&#39;t. You&#39;re just an evil person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flushed. Her pretty face scrunched up in fury as she bared her teeth. Rogue red light flickered around her and Eden watched her carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the nature of this potion?&#34; Adolph asked. &#34;Why does it matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden eyed Delia then looked at Basil who remained frozen in his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I was here what was I?&#34; Eden asked, &#34;An attendant of some kind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A merchant,&#34; Laurel said, &#34;You ran a human merchant caravan that had close ties to Minister Mirabelle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden looked at Gavin, &#34;Who are you to the royal family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flushed, &#34;You--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is the prince&#39;s grandfather,&#34; Laurel said as Gavin went pale. He looked trapped as if he was trying to figure out if he&#39;d inadvertently aided the scheme. Laurel doubted he&#39;d said anything obvious about it, perhaps given too much information about Basil&#39;s incompetence, but nothing more than that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden hummed and looked thoughtful, &#34;Well, I could have given her a False Hearts potion, that would have ensnared an alpha werewolf easily enough, but I could have also given her a Moonstruck potion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin seemed pale, &#34;Eden What? How...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morrigan would have asked for the Moonstruck potion, however...It is...more to her taste.&#34; Eden sighed and looked at Taliesin, &#34;You told me I had an agenda. I succeeded, but placing this impulsive woman in the castle was a part of it. If I was going to reunite the two thrones of the moon, getting rid of the heir would have been a goal. His grandfather likely gave me enough information to pitch both options as options and ingratiate myself into her forces as a half-breed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel watched him looking between Delia and Basil for a few moments. It was so strange to see such an expression on his face. So strange to see this very different personality inhabiting Eden&#39;s body. She was sure she was focusing on this new Eden to keep the terror and shock at bay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel swallowed through her nerves, &#34;You were a general under her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden laughed, &#34;I probably wasn&#39;t even an underling. Morrigan didn&#39;t believe half-breed deserved much of a place in vampire society and she would have believed that I was half-human so long as I never showed her any magic. She knew the Wiccans traded with humans. She wouldn&#39;t have suspected me She would have thought the hell she&#39;d brought to the Wiccan Alliance enough of a deterrent to keep Wiccans out of it while she tried to conquer the other throne of the moon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were important!&#34; Delia cried, &#34;You said-- You said you were powerful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden laughed, &#34;I am powerful, and I doubt I told you that. It would have given far too much away. Besides, what does being powerful have to do with being important to the vampire queen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stammered and her shoulders slumped, &#34;You You tricked me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Save your tears, you made your choices. You were neither forced or coerced I doubt I even bribed you.&#34; Eden chuckled. &#34;You were probably hoping to be the queen of Annwn in some fashion, hm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia&#39;s jaw trembled and she let out a soft sob. He was right. He had vouched for her to a general of the vampire queen, but only after she&#39;d asked to be a part of the scheme. She had volunteered thinking Eden was a prince, and he had handed her to a general to present as a potential agent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Annwn was never under that witch&#39;s domain,&#34; Eden said as Delia slumped in her bonds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enchanting the prince crimes of treason&#34; Gavin gasped, &#34;You should both be executed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia looked up at him glaring at the man and freezing at the smug look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no fear of your execution blade,&#34; Eden said, waving his hand. &#34;Death comes to all and if my crimes are as you say, I was prepared to die for my goals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready Delia for public execution.&#34; Adolph said, &#34;She will be beheaded in the city square.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia couldn&#39;t breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before you do that,&#34; Eden said, &#34;The potion. It&#39;s important. How was it administered?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why does that matter?&#34; Adolph asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The False Hearts potion, is just that. Killing her without breaking the enchantment won&#39;t do anything to him, but the Moonstruck potion will make her death fatal to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia&#39;s heart lifted, remembering his instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said it would give me a bond with him. You said it would be like we were fated!&#34; Delia grinned, &#34;You said it was unbreakable and I followed your instructions when I administered it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden sighed, &#34;You truly are a kindred spirit to Morrigan. Did you even ask anything more about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know nothing about magic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t,&#34; he conceded, &#34;But no enchantment is unbreakable. Was the potion in two parts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden nodded gravely, &#34;The Moonstruck potion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;m saved!&#34; Delia cried, &#34;You can&#39;t kill me without killing Basil! Hah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before she&#39;s executed, I will need to break the enchantment,&#34; Eden said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why you?&#34; Laurel asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is how the potion works,&#34; Eden said, &#34;Only the one who brewed the potion would be able to nullify its effects as it incorporates a bit of the brewer&#39;s magic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you willing to do so?&#34; Adolph asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia paled as Taliesin stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must ask that his willingness to save your son&#39;s life be taken into account.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The potion would have killed him!&#34; An officer said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it wouldn&#39;t have if she&#39;d been patient and charmed the prince,&#34; Eden said. &#34;It would be akin to him finding her as his second chance mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Moonstruck potion used to be used to calm rogues by giving them a temporary mate,&#34; Eden said. &#34;It is not inherently dangerous. I would imagine that Prince Basil has wrestled free of most of the enchantment through his grief for his late wife. Have you been prone to fevers? Chills? Drinking heavily?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil frowned, nodding shakily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re an alpha, right? Like your father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded again. Adolph looked at Basil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When was the last time you shifted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil shook his head, &#34;I I don&#39;t remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Had you shifted, the rest of the enchantment would have likely broken leaving only the bond. It was suppressing your wolf. When it is broken, you&#39;ll be able to access your wolf again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph sat back on his throne but before he could speak, Eden lifted a hand and wiggled his fingers. A ring of golden light around Basil&#39;s chest appeared, cracked in places and whole in others before as it seemed to unravel and melt into the air, flying back to Eden. Basil gasped, pressing a hand to his chest. His eyes glazed over and he trembled a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basil?&#34; Adolph asked, tense. &#34;Are you Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand dropped towards his sword.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil shuddered and curled into himself, &#34;It&#39;s gone&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia wailed, &#34;No! How could you do this, Eden? I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assure you,&#34; Eden said calmly. &#34;I had always planned to undo it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia stared at him for a loss of words before she broke into tears and wailed. Eden eyed her without sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph sighed, rubbing his head. He didn&#39;t want to let Eden live. Taliesin was harried-looking at Eden with pleading eyes as Eden seemed unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take my son to the infirmary to be evaluated. Delia will be executed within the hour,&#34; he looked at Eden, &#34;As for you I grant you leniency. If it is as you say, you have saved my son&#39;s life and that cannot be overlooked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taliesin seemed to deflate with relief. He looked at Laurel who beamed at him. There was a peace in her eyes that hadn&#39;t been there before, and he knew he&#39;d made the right decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basil, wait!&#34; Delia cried, &#34;I-I&#39;m still your wife! Aren&#39;t you going to save me? I love you, and--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil walked past her without glancing at her out of the throne room with an attendant and Adolph nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would be painful going forward, but perhaps it would not be unbearable.</p>
