                <p>Laurel woke up, curled up to Adolph underneath the early morning sun. She blinked blearily up at him and smiled at how peaceful he seemed in the early morning light. Birds twittered nearby. The sun was just starting to warm the air.</p>

                <p>One of his eyes opened and focused on her before he threw his arm over his face and turned to bury his face in her shoulder.</p>

                <p>He narrowed his eyes at her and seized her by her waist, tickling her until she shrieked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You find such an event funny, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She twisted, trying to get away from him and shrieking, &#34;Forgive me, Your Majesty! I was merely joking!&#34;</p>

                <p>Chasel walked towards the guards he&#39;d set up to keep a guard over Adolph and Laurel&#39;s dinner the night before. The guards had changed out, but this set looked highly amused. Chasel lifted an eyebrow at one of them as he flashed a grin and Laurel&#39;s shriek tore through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, approaching their secluded area and finding Adolph pinning Laurel beneath him. Her arms wrapped around his waist as he seemed to be marauding her mouth. Chasel&#39;s jaw dropped as Laurel let out a little moan and he quickly walked back behind the tree he passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t been prepared to see Adolph in such a state. He smiled to himself, understanding why the guards seemed so amused. It was good that they were recovering from the scare. He wanted to give them more time, but the ministers needed to be dealt with as soon as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph had already dismissed the minister of general affairs in swift quiet, so none of the other ministers knew, but if Chasel was right about what he planned to announce, it was best to get him washed up, fed, and dressed to be as menacing as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel stepped back from behind the tree and approached the two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel gasped as Adolph growled against her neck, licking at the mating mark and sending shivers of pleasure through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Your Majesty, please&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone cleared their throat and Adolph growled again, looking up as Laurel squeaked and hid her face in his chest. He glowered at Chasel. He had been grateful the man had retreated before Laurel had noticed his presence before, but he was not happy about being interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Your Majesty, please,&#34; Laurel whispered furiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re interrupting, Chasel and embarrassing Laurel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am well aware of your lack of shame, Your Majesty,&#34; Chasel said primly. &#34;I thought you might want breakfast before you deal with the ministers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph groaned, &#34;Fine, fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted himself and smiled down at Laurel who had covered her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shall I escort you back to your quarters so you may prepare for the day, Laurel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scowled at him over the edges of her hands, flushed and embarrassed. How was she supposed to sit beside him and attend to serious matters knowing they had been caught in such a compromising position by Chasel?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That would be most kind, Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled at her tense tone and stood before pulling her onto her feet. He threw the blanket over his shoulder and grabbed the basket, taking her hand and leading her back to the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed a kiss to her hand and left her at the door to her quarters before returning to his quarters and getting ready for the day. He felt refreshed and at ease. Chasel came to him as he was getting dressed in his best vest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfectly menacing,&#34; Chasel said with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph grinned, &#34;So glad you approve. Shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They reached the hall and Adolph didn&#39;t address the empty seat though every minister was staring at it. He took his seat at the head of the table and nodded as Henry, Dorian and other heads of the surrounding packs entered and took their seats. The table was full within a few minutes leaving only the minister of general affairs&#39; seat empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are awaiting one more person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened just as the ministers seemed to relax, and Laurel glided in wearing a gown several steps above casual with a black bodice, mirroring his black vest. She walked around the table as Adolph stood to help her sit in the luna&#39;s seat to his left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil&#39;s eyes widened and he was stunned into silence seeing her. Was she supposed to be here? Had his mother sat there? He glanced at Gavin, confused. He had never been in any of the ministry meetings before Adolph had returned, let alone Laura. Gavin told him that his mother had known her place as luna and was nothing like Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head was spinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve called this meeting to discuss my marriage to Luna Laurel,&#34; Adolph said. &#34;Everyone in this room is aware of the poisoning attempt on my life and Laurel&#39;s, but the investigation has led nowhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel forced herself to keep calm and to maintain a composed face even as her heart wanted to beat out of her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With all due respect, Your Majesty The minister of general affairs&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph smirked, wicked and knowing, &#34;Has been dismissed, and will not be replaced. Luna Laurel will be taking over his duties as he was found in violation of his position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil swallowed the gasp as his grandfather&#39;s expression grew tense on the other side of the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is unlikely that they will attempt poison again, but they are aware that my wedding is the most opportune time to attack. To that end, we will hold my marriage ceremony at the old temple, ensuring the safety of the constituents and Luna Laurel. It will force whatever vampire forces have come to a disadvantage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t understand why, but he nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chasel, Luna Raven of the Black Mountain Pack, and Luna Irene of the Red Forest Pack will be in charge of organizing the ceremony. I expect Minister Mirabelle, the minister of peace, and my son to make themselves fully available to them for any reason as is their duty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil frowned looking at Gavin though he flushed a bit. Adolph turned to look at Raven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna Raven and Luna Irene, thank you in advance for your efforts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They beamed at him and turned a kind smile to Laurel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything to be of service, Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Henry and Alpha Dorian, I appreciate you loaning your wives for this endeavor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not say it as though we had a choice in the matter,&#34; Henry said with a grin at Laurel. &#34;You have a strong woman at your side. I have a feeling you know the feeling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel ducked her head as a soft red flush spread across her cheeks. It was such a sweet expression Basil was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty, what of Prince Basil&#39;s wife, Lady Delia?&#34; Gavin asked, &#34;Surely, you do not mean to exclude her from assisting? Should she not be here as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph lifted an eyebrow at him, &#34;Are you feeling alright, Minister Mirabelle? To ask such a question makes me question your mental health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin sputtered, &#34;Y-Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Though I suppose, this is not something you had to remember considering the circumstance of your position. The wife of the heir can only be included by invitation of the luna outside of the ceremonial place at the brunch table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil looked at Laurel, who looked at Raven and Irene, &#34;If you need an extra pair of hands, you have my leave to call on Prince Basil&#39;s wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven nodded, smiling at her, &#34;I&#39;m sure a young, new wife has better things to be doing these days than preparing another&#39;s wedding? It will be unlikely but thank you for the offer. Is there anything we should take note of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded at her. She knew it was, but it felt good to be able to say that Delia was free to participate if needed. It felt as though she had lost some of the bitter resentment and hatred from her past life. She looked at Basil who seemed confused and a bit lost at the conversation and felt the faintest stirring in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Adolph and smiled before looking back at Raven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nine on all fronts,&#34; Laurel said and watched Raven&#39;s eyes shine with joy. &#34;And all the traditions you can manage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irene grinned at her, &#34;As Her Majesty commands, so it will be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded, &#34;I&#39;d like as much of the food sourced from the orchard as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph watched the ministers&#39; faces. Among them, Gavin was the least surprising. He looked furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good. In his experience, anger in an opponent led to an opening and a decisive end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirked as an idea came to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What would make the vampire queen and her forces angry enough to show their hand?</p>
