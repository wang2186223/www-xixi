                <p>Adolph walked down the corridor towards the dining room.  He was exhausted after a long day of listening to Chasel&#39;s report about the progress of the lockdown of the city and the preparations for his marriage.  He hadn&#39;t been called in, having skipped practice to deal with other matters, he was looking forward to sitting down with the soldiers eating a full meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph nodded and Sam and Lynn, &#34;It&#39;s good to see you both. How are things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sam and Lynn shared a glance as Adolph settled into a seat beside them.  It was strange for them. Adolph shared plenty of meals with them on the battlefield, but now that they were back in the castle, they expected him to eat at the noble&#39;s table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s going well enough.  How are you, Your Majesty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph sighed, &#34;I&#39;m hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men laughed, a light relieved sound he&#39;d heard infrequently while on the front lines. It was a bit of a relief to hear his men somewhat at ease even if he couldn&#39;t be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph scanned the table and frowned at the sight of the unfamiliar petal jam jars.  There should&#39;ve been one for each group of four soldiers to share, but there were less than that, maybe one for every twenty men. Depending on what was being served for lunch, they would run out within a few minutes. It was bad luck to run out of petal jam during a meal, so they always provided an abundance of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jars didn&#39;t even seem to have been refilled since breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is all the petal jam?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s coming. The kitchen has been a bit slow lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I guess Maria is keeping a closer eye on everything now so there isn&#39;t another incident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph nodded. It was likely but unnecessary.  Something at the back of his mind said something was off, but he did know exactly what it was.  Maria knew that the food was poisoned during the delivery of the meal, not the making of it, so why would she go to such lengths?  Maybe she was just being cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the doors opened in the hallway with a cheer as servants entered with carts of food and began to place the large platters on the table. The scent of bread and meat made his stomach rumble with hunger. He reached for the nearest jar of petal jam and pulled the top off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent struck him and he halted, looking down into the jar. The color was a bit too light to be Maria&#39;s jam, and if Maria&#39;s jam wasn&#39;t being served to the soldiers, there was something wrong.  He set the jar down and looked at the nearest servant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty, what&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Maria?&#34; Adolph asked the servant. The woman stiffened and ducked her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;T-The luna dismissed her, shortly after breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He heard Sam take a sharp breath before Adolph turned and left the hall. His hunger would only make him more irritable, but maybe it would serve as a lesson for Delia and this foolish need to disrupt everything in the palace with her whims.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily and Chasel walked down the hall towards him. She looked furious, and she gasped upon seeing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty,&#34; Lily greeted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel stepped between them, &#34;Maria has been restored to her position as has everyone else that was let go by Lady Delia this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph looked at Chasel briefly, &#34;Where is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Delia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel winced, wishing he could lie to him but he sighed and stepped aside, &#34;She was supposed to be meeting with the heads of the orphanage, school, and hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph walked past them and into the kitchen. People were running around with trays, getting things onto carts, and hurrying out. He walked through the room towards where Maria usually was and found her there stirring a large pot of fragrant, hot liquid: petal jam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent eased something furious and distressed in him. It was such a simple comfort, but he would take it for as long as he could manage to keep it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maria smiled at him, kind and knowing before pulling a small jar out of her pocket and offering it to him: a jar of her petal jam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For future reference, Your Majesty, the royal stash is where it always has been.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, closing his hand around it, &#34;Thank you, Maria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeni, could you please escort His Majesty to where Luna Raven of the Black Mountain pack is taking lunch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeni nodded and Adolph chuckled, following the young man down the hallway until he reached the room where Raven, her husband, and the rest of his extended family were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes twinkled with knowing and she nodded to the empty seat, &#34;Please join us, Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed and nodded, preparing to deal with Delia, Basil, and the rest of the havoc that had exploded since Laurel had been poisoned after he&#39;d eaten a full meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours later, Adolph walked down the hallway towards Laurel&#39;s room. It was late, nearly midnight now, but it was the only time he had to spare between Chasel&#39;s reports, the ongoing investigation, and the trouble Delia was causing. He should have said to hell with the ministers and accepted Raven&#39;s help, but that was a battle for another day. He&#39;d stopped Delia&#39;s move to discontinue funding to the orphanage, school, and hospital and revoked her right to dismiss anyone without approval by Lily or Chasel. He&#39;d have to have another conversation with Basil and his wife soon, but for now, he just wanted a bit of peace before bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He entered her room and found Sarah tidying up and collecting the used clothes. She dropped into a deep curtsey upon seeing him and left moments later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled, hoping she and Sam were finding happiness together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He entered her bed chamber and found her still lying eerily still. He sunk onto the side of her bed and took her hand the way he always did. She was warmer than she had been the last time he&#39;d come to visit, but she wasn&#39;t awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was the antidote working? How much longer would it take?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t think he could hold out indefinitely. He wasn&#39;t even sure how he had been making it through for the past few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel,&#34; he whispered. &#34;Please love wake up and tell me you&#39;re okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes fluttered and he held his breath, freezing in place as she turned her head. Hope swelled in his chest as her eyes opened. Her brilliant green eyes caught some of the glow of the low burning fire and rolled to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A dolph?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lunged forward, pressing his lips to hers and lifting her against him, her lips tasted a bit bitter like medicine, but his heart was singing as he drew back and pressed her against his chest, murmuring prayers of thanks to the moon goddess and overcome with relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel felt his warmth around her, grounding her to the fact that she was alive. The scent of cedar, roses, and blood filled her nose, soothing her even as the panic and terror of her nightmares and poison-induced coma was building in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph was there, holding her close as if she were precious. His lips tasted sweet, like petal jam, and she was still dizzy, but she was alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For how much longer?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel?&#34; Adolph whispered as she felt her lungs growing tight and her breath was coming out in struggling little pants. &#34;Laurel, darling, you have to breathe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I,&#34; she panted. &#34;I I I can&#39;t I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph drew her closer, allowing her to struggle against him as the panic started to take over and kept her pressed against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t! I want to go home! I should have never become luna. I don&#39;t want to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go! Let me go!&#34; She cried, struggling against him, but she was too weak to budge him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel, listen to me,&#34; Adolph said, nuzzling her. &#34;You&#39;re safe now. You&#39;re safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not safe! I&#39;ll die again! I&#39;ll die!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again? Adolph frowned as she continued to scream and try to escape his arms. He&#39;d have to ask what she meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You weren&#39;t the ultimate target,&#34; Adolph whispered. &#34;Tina poisoned your soup, but that bowl was originally meant for me and it was poisoned before she got hold of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel drew in a sharp breath, &#34; You? Poison?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph nodded, stroking her hair, &#34;Tina&#39;s never leaving the dungeons as anything more than a corpse. I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Poisoned you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Adolph said, &#34;Likely an assassination attempt by the vampire queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel breathed deeply and wrapped her arms around him. The moon goddess&#39; warning echoed in her ears. Adolph needed her. She stood in defense of the kingdom, but only with him at her side. They could not defend the kingdom without one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;H-How long have I been out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nearly a week,&#34; Adolph said. &#34;It has been the hardest week of my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nuzzled him and drew her lips across his cheek, &#34;My apologies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never apologize for this,&#34; Adolph said, &#34;Just let me hold you a bit longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you stay with me?&#34; Laurel asked, sagging against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Always.&#34;</p>
