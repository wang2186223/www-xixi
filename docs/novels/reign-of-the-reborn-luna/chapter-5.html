                <p>*Lucas*, Alice growled in contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel&#39;s lips curled in disgust and she sneered at him. This was the coward her father wrote about. Fury filled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would *never* marry you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas barked a laugh, &#34;Don&#39;t be so silly. I&#39;m the best option of the pack! I don&#39;t care that you&#39;re not my mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words struck her in her chest, and for a moment, she saw Basil and Delia, dressed in fine clothing and sneering at her. Her stomach roiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirked, &#34;You&#39;re pretty enough. When I become alpha, you&#39;ll be my luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nausea heaved and she fought it back with her anger. Who the hell did he think he was? Who the hell had Basil thought he was? Prince or not, he was an arrogant, stupid man. Lucas was nowhere near as attractive, influential, or important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bared her teeth, &#34;No one wants to be your damn luna!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas licked his lips, his eyes turned heated as he dragged his gaze over her body, sending a fresh wave of nausea through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not something you really have to worry about. You could never really be my luna. You can&#39;t even hunt yet!&#34; He laughed. &#34;I don&#39;t need that you&#39;re more suited to be the cute kitten warming my bed, anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice roared as Laurel screamed, grabbing the nearest object and throwing it at him. The barrel burst apart against his chest and soaking him in water. He covered his face with a cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you doing?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel screeched at him. Her anger felt so much bigger than it ever had been before, a blazing inferno in place of the small flickers she had felt as Laura. Laura had needed to watch her manners, to control her emotions and behave accordingly, but Laura was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel Miller, the daughter of Jack Miller of the Sapphire Lake Pack was just a seventeen-year-old young woman. She could be rude. She could be loud. She could curse and fight and defend herself however she wanted to. She didn&#39;t have to marry a prince or a coward who thought himself important. She didn&#39;t have to take his abuse or put up with a damn thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel was every bit as free as Laura had always wished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*That&#39;s right!* Alice howled, gleefully. *Show him just what you think of him.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a shameless bastard! A deserter! A c*oward* and thief!&#34; She growled at him, snatching the rabbit from his hands and shoving him away from her door. He stumbled aside with a gasp. &#34;Why would I *ever* marry a lowly creature like *you*? Who would ever marry a thing like you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoved him again, &#34;Get the fuck away from my house, and don&#39;t you ever come near me again, or I swear to the goddess you will *wish* my father came back sooner!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas seemed frozen, staring at her in disbelief. She couldn&#39;t believe how arrogant he was to think that she would just continue to deal with his harassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flushed and lifted his hand, &#34;You--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice and Laurel growled at him, causing him to go pale and stumble back. The old woman, Amanda, came rushing out of her house next door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped and glared at Lucas, &#34;You! Stay away from Laurel!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas flinched at Amanda&#39;s voice and lowered his hand sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elder Amanda--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda growled at him, her eyes flashed in warning. He ducked his head and scurried away.  Amanda didn&#39;t relax until he had disappeared before turning to Laurel with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such spark!&#34; Amanda chuckled, &#34;I think I&#39;ll tell your father you&#39;re more than capable of taking care of yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel smiled at her and lifted her head proudly even though her face was warm with embarrassment. She felt good standing up for herself. She didn&#39;t know how or when she had gained the confidence to curse out a would-be suitor, but maybe it meant she was starting to live as Laurel, completely free from at least some of the things that had restrained Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed down the fur of the rabbit and offered it to Amanda, &#34;A gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda chuckled and waved her away, &#34;You&#39;re still too skinny to be offering me food, child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled and nodded before walking back into her house and setting the rabbit on the table. To celebrate, she shifted and went out hunting again for dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice laughed, *Who knew cursing out arrogant men could work up such an appetite!*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas didn&#39;t return and Laurel spent her days hunting, writing letters to her father, and helping with the duties in the village. After a few weeks, Amanda had looked at her with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve put on some weight!&#34; Amanda pinched her cheek, fondly. &#34;You look good. I&#39;m glad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel hadn&#39;t spent much time paying attention to her appearance, enjoying the freedom from doing so, but when she came home from hunting one day, she took a moment to look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The face she&#39;d seen in the puddle in the forest was still there: long black hair, green eyes, and full lips, but her cheeks had filled out. Her features were reminiscent of Laura&#39;s but younger, more at ease, vibrant, and truly beautiful. Laurel smiled at her reflection, shocked at the beauty looking back at her, unadorned in her plain, patched dress and a bit dirty from tussling in the dirt with her latest kill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t think there was a dress, silk or satin, or a finely wrought accessory from Laura&#39;s closet that could enhance or even compliment the young woman in the mirror. She didn&#39;t want any of it anyway. Maybe she wouldn&#39;t be remarkable in this life either, but she would be free, happy, and loved, and that was enough for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, she went hunting for her and Amanda&#39;s lunch. She&#39;d found her prey quickly and killed it just as quickly. As she returned, Amanda rushed to her with a wide smile and full of excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel! The king had defeated the vampires!&#34; Amanda embraced her tightly. &#34;They&#39;ve won! The war is over. The men are returning!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squealed, embracing Amanda in excitement. Her father would be coming home! She looked down at the patches in her dress and looked up at Amanda, unsure. She wanted to see her father, but would she be able to fool him? Did they have inside jokes? Would her mannerisms give her away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure in such a shabby dress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda dragged her next door and shoved a new dress and cloak into her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amanda&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your father has been away for four years. In rags or silk, he&#39;ll want to see you.&#34; Amanda smiled. &#34;Go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel looked down at the dress and nodded, &#34;You&#39;re right. I should go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a silly fear. It was so unlikely that anyone who was in the Imperial City would be among the caravan of returning men, let alone anyone who may have seen her before. She changed quickly and went with Amanda toward the village center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed that every werewolf of the Sapphire Lake Pack, young or old, had left their work for the day to come and see the returning procession, but they didn&#39;t seem to be staying in the town square. They were heading west.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re passing through Silver Blade. If we hurry, we can get there before they do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silver Blade was a few miles away, but there was no way that Amanda would be able to keep up with the rest of the group at her age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda sighed, &#34;Go without me, Laurel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel frowned and kneeled, &#34;I&#39;ll carry you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda seemed hesitant but Laurel huffed, &#34;Come on or we&#39;ll fall behind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda nodded, climbing on her back and letting Laurel lift her to follow the caravan. She would likely end up at the back because she was carrying Amanda, but they would get there. Mothers carried their younger children. Some pulled carts and rode horses, but everyone focused on the path forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda tapped her shoulder, &#34;Hurry! Hurry, Laurel, or we&#39;ll miss them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel chuckled, forcing herself to try and pick up the pace though she was already feeling a bit worn out.  She had never seen Amanda so happy. She knew from the neighbors that Amanda had lost her son to a vampire attack over a decade ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t think there could ever be better news than the king&#39;s victory for her. Maybe Amanda could put the memory of her son to rest and enjoy the rest of her life with some measure of peace. With the threat of vampires over, it would be safe to travel beyond Sapphire Lake and the other packs&#39; villages in the area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she will find her mate at last. Would her father come with her on that search?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hurry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel laughed, caught up in Amanda&#39;s excitement, and pushed herself to run faster and faster until she was near the front of the group and the small town rose from behind the hill in the distance and a sign told her that Silver Blade was just ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We made it!&#34;</p>
