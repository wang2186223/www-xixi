                <p>Basil looked at his father in horror as Tina was dragged into the hall and put before his throne. Tina curled up, sobbing pitifully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pl-Please have mercy. I don&#39;t want to die. I don&#39;t want to die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father,&#34; Basil said. &#34;Does she not deserve leniency for all of her years of service? It&#39;s probably just a mistake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph looked at Basil, &#34;Tina. Do you confess to the crime of attempted murder?&#34;</p>

                <p>Basil&#39;s eyes widened. He paled and he closed his mouth in shock. Adolph was grateful that he didn&#39;t need to keep Basil on his list of potential threats. For all of his stupidity, Basil was still his son and heir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I I only did it for Luna Olivia,&#34; she cried. &#34;Please, you have to understand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What say the ministers for sentencing?&#34; Adolph asked, and looked at Gavin. &#34;Minister Mirabelle as she was once a servant of your house, you may speak first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes turned bright and hopeful looking up at Gavin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No true servant of my family would ever have attempted murder,&#34; Gavin sneered. &#34;Let alone someone so vital to His Majesty!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph narrowed his eyes, intrigued by Gavin&#39;s stance as Tina shuddered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My daughter would be ashamed of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tina choked on a sob and started to bawl, collapsing to the floor. Adolph looked at Basil who looked distinctly uncomfortable at the display. No one else spoke for a while before Adolph decided he had nothing else to learn from the ministers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They may resent him and his marriage to Laurel, but they weren&#39;t bold enough to try and kill him or Laurel. He would have to look elsewhere and keep an eye on them in case they started to think murder was a viable option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well. I find you guilty of attempted murder,&#34; Adolph said. &#34;By law, you are eligible for execution.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil drew in a sharp breath as Tina shuddered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;However, death would be too merciful a sentence,&#34; Adolph said. &#34;Instead, you will be placed in the lowest part of the dungeon. There you will remain until your last breath. Take her away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tina shrieked in terror as the guards advanced to lift her from the floor and take her to the dungeons. He glanced at Basil who looked haunted and a bit nauseous as Tina&#39;s screams faded down the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now,&#34; Adolph said, &#34;To the matter of acting luna. While Laurel is recovering, Lady Raven of the Black Mountain Pack has offered to fill in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The minister of justice cleared his throat, &#34;With all due respect, it would be gravely offensive to Prince Basil and his new wife to allow such a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph eyed him. &#34;Would it? It would be gravely offensive to me to be told to ignore the fact that Delia is unfit for the position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is the prince&#39;s wife,&#34; another minister said. &#34;At the very least, she will need the experience for the day you are no longer on the throne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, how can she learn to stand at Prince Basil&#39;s side without the chance to do so?&#34; Another minister asked. &#34;Basil&#39;s late wife, Laura, was given time-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And she proved herself more than capable without support or tutelage as I have been told. What has Delia done in the time since her death other than terrorize the servants?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father,&#34; Basil began, gripping his fists. &#34;Please give Delia a chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph met his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As I recall&#34; Another minister began. &#34;Wasn&#39;t Lady Raven in the heart of an imperial issue years ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, is she the best choice? Going from a seventeen-year-old girl to a political threat doesn&#39;t seem to be wise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph almost smirked at how confused Basil seemed. It was cunning for them to bring up the speculation about Liam&#39;s birth and if Raven would try to claim the throne, but Adolph had anticipated it. Raven had anticipated it and they agreed that it was the best chance to get another read on how the ministers felt about Laurel and if they were a threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well,&#34; Adolph said. &#34;Laurel will only be bedridden for a short term under the priestess and Eden&#39;s care. I&#39;m sure Delia cannot do much damage in that short amount of time if she proves herself incapable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She won&#39;t,&#34; Basil said resolutely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph smirked, amused at his conviction. He could almost hear Irene&#39;s snarky tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Famous last words.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia hadn&#39;t thought it would be so easy to get the position and the power. If she had, she would have poisoned Laurel ages ago. Gavin gave her a pleased smile as if all of his plans had come to a head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From today on, you are the luna,&#34; Gavin said. &#34;As you should have been as Basil&#39;s wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil smiled and drew closer to her, &#34;I know Delia will do a great job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia smiled brightly before leaving. She headed upstairs towards the luna&#39;s office, planning to look around her new office in hopes to find something useful for the mission and something luxurious to keep. Maybe a bracelet or something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze at the sound of Adolph&#39;s voice and turned slowly towards Adolph, but did not look him in the eye. She steadied her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The ministers n-named me luna, Your Majesty. I&#39;m going to my office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph let out a huff of laughter, &#34;Your office is in the opposite direction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m the-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wife of my son,&#34; Adolph said. &#34;And this arrangement is temporary. You will not be given access to Laurel&#39;s office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia&#39;s jaw trembled as his voice grew soft and borderline menacing. It sent a shiver of fear through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned sharply and hurried back down the hallway. She didn&#39;t go to the office but returned to her room to try and get her heart under control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was fine that she couldn&#39;t have the office. She still had the power and the access to all the money. She smirked and looked around before deciding to leave her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted a new bracelet for the terror she&#39;d experienced. Laurel got a charm bracelet made of gold, so she&#39;d get one at least twice as nice as hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took her an hour to find a shop that would sell her a charm bracelet to her standard. She gave them the rest of the money she had on her person before returning to the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked down the hallway, admiring the new bracelet around her wrist before someone grabbed her and pulled her into a room, covering her mouth with a large warm hand. The full warmth of his body pressed up against her made her heart race with excitement as Eden glared down at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She realized that the room had been Laura&#39;s office and was now the office she was meant to work out of while Laurel recovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden&#39;s eyes narrowed, &#34;Explain yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say to the maid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia&#39;s eyes widened, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The maid, Delia. Tina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia frowned and shook her head, &#34;Nothing much. She was&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked up at him, feeling her face warm as he slipped his hand around her neck to cup the nape of her neck, as a dark and sexy smile broke across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not in the mood, Delia,&#34; he said, in a low rumbling voice. &#34;Talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia gasped meeting his gaze, &#34;I didn&#39;t say much of anything to her. She was crying in front of her mistress&#39; portrait. She had something in her hand. I thought it was poison and I sort of baited her with the idea of taking care of Basil&#39;s heir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted an eyebrow, &#34;Are you pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shuddered, &#34;Of course, not!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden scoffed, &#34;You would have been more useful if you were.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pouted a bit at the thought, &#34;Why are you so upset? If Laurel and Adolph are gone then-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I gave you instructions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I followed them!&#34; Delia said. &#34;I poured the whole vial in his dish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You poured it into Laurel&#39;s bowl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How was I supposed to know?&#34; She lifted her chin with pride. &#34;I took the other plate just to be sure they&#39;d give it to the king! Who serves the king second?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eye twitched and held out his hand, &#34;Give me the vial.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled it out of her bodice and handed it to him. He tucked it into a hidden pocket in his jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lucky. That maid has taken the blame for the oleander poisoning, but he&#39;ll be suspicious about the wolfsbane and whatever else Tina told him. Next time, be certain about who you are poisoning. Follow the plan, Delia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pouted looking up at him, drawing closer, but he pulled back sharply, leaving her to stumble forward. She huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the problem if she dies? It would just make it easier for the plan to succeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden turned on her, his eyes flashed and he snarled at her. His teeth seemed oddly sharp as he glared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave Laurel alone.&#34; His fury eased and the cool regard returned. &#34;This is your only warning, Delia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her fist as he left. Laurel was more of a barrier than she first thought if even Eden was protecting her. After Adolph was out of the picture, she&#39;d have to find a way to get Laurel out of the way the same way she&#39;d gotten rid of Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Eden didn&#39;t know that she&#39;d killed her.</p>
