                <p>If Delia had to mop another dirty floor, she&#39;d scream, pull a nurse&#39;s hair out, and bash her brains in. The nurses and cleaning staff of the hospital were all dull and irritating, never taking the hint that Delia didn&#39;t care about any of the people in the hospital&#39;s well-being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the hospital was better than the orphanage. Being surrounded by all those pathetic children reminded her of her childhood in a way she never wanted to think about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to play nice with Laurel and obeying her orders was going to drive her crazy. She needed another plan to get Basil to think differently about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are slouching,&#34; Helena said primly, cutting into Delia&#39;s thoughts as the book clattered to the floor. &#34;Try again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to lunge across the room and tear the woman&#39;s hair out, but knowing that Adolph had hired her stayed her hand. She didn&#39;t need to make an enemy of Adolph. She couldn&#39;t afford to. Eden was gone, but she knew he&#39;d want to see some sort of progress when he got back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been leaving Basil alone as he came back from working all day, ate dinner, and drank himself to sleep like clockwork. While she appreciated what it was doing to him physically, hardening the softer parts of his body and putting muscle on him, she could do without being ignored by her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he could manage to stay awake long enough to hear her plight, she might have been able to get her out of a bit more of Helena&#39;s sessions, but she didn&#39;t know how to speak to him without thinking about his drunken words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*My wolf hates you.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wedding was approaching soon and she wasn&#39;t even sure she&#39;d make it through this session without losing her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she was wrong. Maybe she should just give up and escape, feigning her death and disappearing with whatever she could take with her never to be seen again. At least, she wouldn&#39;t have to deal with whatever Eden considered as proper disposal of her. She wouldn&#39;t have to go back to where she came from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could cut her losses and run. It would be better than being pulled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The book clattered to the ground again and she huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helena looked at her, &#34;Take a break. We&#39;ll pick up in an hour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia was surprised at the woman&#39;s lenience, but she took the out and left the room without a word before wandering to a quiet corridor near the kitchens and looking out the window to the orchard. The gate had been pulled down and people were going in and out of the orchard with large baskets and equipment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a real victory to get Basil to put the gate up after Laura&#39;s death. She&#39;d had to plead and whine a bit, but it had been worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only Adolph had died of poisoning then, this wouldn&#39;t be happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed. It would be easy to escape, but she couldn&#39;t bring herself to willingly go back to having nothing after having so much. Walking around with books on her head made her feel stupid, but it was better than the cold and dangerous wilds. She didn&#39;t like having to read books she didn&#39;t care about, but it was better than an empty stomach and constantly fearing for her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was tougher than this. She had changed to be a simpering fan of Basil&#39;s to get close to him. She could change to be the perfect noble wife too with a little practice. She just had to change her view on the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was training, acting, another batch of skills to add to her skill set that would keep her fed, warm, and safe. All she had to do was get Basil to love her. She could do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He may love Laura, but she was dead and she wasn&#39;t coming back. No man would turn down a warm, living body for a memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something rustled nearby and she turned and gasped, seeing a pair of familiar figures bringing in food, dressed like a merchant and speaking with the servants. He was a member of Eden&#39;s caravan and part of his forces in the capital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he doing in the capital?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned, likely feeling her staring at him. She nodded her head to an alcove nearby and walked toward it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard him follow her down the hall and around the corner to where no one would see or hear them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; Delia asked. &#34;This wasn&#39;t part of the plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He eyed her and smirked, &#34;If you don&#39;t know, then you don&#39;t need to know. We&#39;re playing it close to the chest, so keep your head down and your mouth shut.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tipped his hat and walked away leaving Delia a little put out. She was a vital part of this mission. Why would she be left out? Was it a failsafe in case they were caught and killed? Maybe Eden had kept her out of it for her safety? A little thrill went through her at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That seemed about right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she was further into the castle than anyone else. She was the one who told him about the marriage ceremony being moved to the temple on the grounds. The thought lightened her mood. She stopped off in the kitchens for a snack and skipped back to the parlor where Helena waited, ready to try again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helena watched Delia enter and pick up the book to balance on her head. She wasn&#39;t sure what had inspired Delia to change her attitude, but something in her churned with anxiety. From what she had observed, Delia was not the type to suddenly change her tune about anything. There was something sly and devious about her that she&#39;d only seen in Olivia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe the adage about men marrying their mothers was true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil may have never met Olivia, but he was exposed to Gavin and Tina over the years. She shook her head. The poor child had no idea what a rude awakening he was in for when Adolph started to educate him on the truth of his station. She wondered briefly if Basil would end up cracking and escaping to live with his grandfather on whatever piece of land Gavin managed to retain after everything was said and done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia stumbled and grit her teeth. Helena went to her and took one of her hands, lifting her arm at her side and pressing on the small of Delia&#39;s back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Straighten your spine and walk heel to toe, gently. This does not need to be a race.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia clenched her jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is often in the calming of one&#39;s mind you find your grace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel seemed to have it done and she&#39;s from a random village in the country.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, &#34;Are you jealous of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed, &#34;Why would I be jealous of a seventeen-year-old?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She favors your husband&#39;s late wife. She has taken up her mantle with grace and efficacy. His Majesty trusts her unconditionally... You are sentenced to etiquette due to the mishandling of her duties though you see the position as rightfully yours...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia&#39;s eyes flashed with fury, a little red light that made Helena&#39;s heart skip in fear. Something was very very wrong, but she continued speaking calmly. How could a woman married to her mate have rogue tendencies? Did Adolph know about this? How would she even tell him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are many reasons, logical and not, to envy her position, but it is not in that emotion you will gain mastery over what you want...&#34; Helena said and stepped away. &#34;You must find the truth of what you want and pursue it on your merit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia took a step. Helena said a lot of things that she didn&#39;t care about but she took the time to consider her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she wanted were luxury and comfort. She wanted power and status. She wanted to never go back to where she came from. She wanted respect and admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked ahead. The only path to that required her to walk around the room with the book on her head and to somehow get rid of Laurel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d gotten rid of Laura easily enough. How much harder could it be to get rid of Laurel?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she get Laurel out into the forest and shove her over the cliff the way she had shoved Laura?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she contemplated it, she found her steps even and sure. The book wobbled a bit on her head, but it didn&#39;t fall as she made it halfway around the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Lady Helena had good ideas after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached the place she had started from and Helena clapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wonderful. Now, go again and recite *The Lone Heart* .&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia barely stifled the groan but started walking and repeating what little she remembered of the poem.</p>
