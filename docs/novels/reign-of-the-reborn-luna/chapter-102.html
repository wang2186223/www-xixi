                <p>The morning of the wedding came faster than she imagined it would.  She prepared to leave her room to start the traditions of the day only to find Basil standing outside of her door looking as though he was about to knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed at him in suspicion, &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;But you&#39;re--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel, the king&#39;s mate and luna, and you are the prince, his son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil clenched his jaw, &#34;I can&#39;t accept that. Didn&#39;t you love me? You can&#39;t say that you don&#39;t feel anything for me anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes turned cold as she looked at him unfeeling and unflinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;You are nothing.&#34;* Basil&#39;s blood ran cold as the cool breeze of that night whirled around him. *&#34;Though I am glad you have shown your wretched face.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look of shock on his face gave her the strength to keep going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soon, the kingdom will know that His Majesty *is my mate and the one I will love for the rest of my life*.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laura--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be the luna of the kingdom.&#34; She lifted her chin and looked down her nose at him. &#34;As for you, Basil Raymond, *I care not what happens to you* after we are married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t&#34; Basil gasped, shuddering. &#34;You can&#39;t do this to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed and walked past him, &#34;*I told you. I will do as I please.*&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil turned and watched her go, at a loss for words. Guilt and regret consumed him. Hadn&#39;t those words been echoing in his mind for days now? What else did he expect her to say? Is this how she felt when he&#39;d said those things to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he whispered but she didn&#39;t stop as if he&#39;d never spoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d heard him as if she hadn&#39;t walked away from him, but she didn&#39;t care. She walked down the hall alone to the parlor where the brunch was meant to happen, keeping her head high and her back straight. She opened the door and found Raven, Irene, and everyone else present. smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So glad that everyone can make it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rounded the table and took her seat. The place settings were the same, though the room was different. She was nervous sitting at the table with everyone who had been at the original brunch, but things were different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trays that came in smelled different than the ones from before. Lily and Sarah stood at her side and tasted everything first to her surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s important that you&#39;re comfortable,&#34; Sarah said. &#34;It&#39;s important that you know that the food is safe so that you can enjoy your wedding fully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides, I&#39;m not opposed to having a taste of everything!&#34; Lilly said, sending a peal of laughter through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Delia who had not said anything since entering the room. Laurel ordered that the food be served all at one time, and they worked their way through the courses with light conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the soup was set in front of her she shook, but she forced herself to eat until she could see the blooming pattern of lunar flowers at the bottom of the bowl, five in total, just as she was supposed to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little sigh of relief left her. At the very least, no one had interfered with the procedures this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After brunch, they returned to her quarters to get ready. As promised the gown was nothing like the dress she wore the last time. Long and flowing, the fabric was lighter and seemed to shimmer with silver in the threads. It hung loosely from her frame before they wrapped a silver cord around her waist to cinch it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look like a great ancestor. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irene set a wreath of lunar flowers on our head attached to a gossamer veil before Raven gave her the bouquet of twenty-seven flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready?&#34; Raven asked, meeting her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolf looked in the mirror adjusting his white robes and cinching silver rope around his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha, only you can make temple robes look that good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Henry through the mirror and grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hear the Raymond genes are very strong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry laughed as Adolph turned back to his reflection. He liked this look a lot more than the formal, straight lines of his suit. There was something ancient and powerful about the look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your crown, Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled as Chasel offered him a simple wreath of silver lunar flower leaves. He set it in his hair as the door opened and Basil entered. His shoulders were slumped; his head was down. He looked distraught. He crossed the room silently to the bottle of alcohol sitting on the table. Adolf crossed the room and took the bottle from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will not be drunk at my wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil lifted his head. His eyes seemed vacant and staring at him as if he didn&#39;t recognize him. A spark of realization flickered in them before his eyes turned hostile and resentful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father, I have to speak with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolf had a feeling he knew what he was about to say, but he nodded and asked the others to leave for a moment. When the door closed behind them, Adolph spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it, Basil?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s about Laurel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basil--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not who you think she is. She&#39;s Laura. I don&#39;t know how she got into Laurel&#39;s body, but she&#39;s definitely Laura.&#34; His eyes hardened. &#34;You can&#39;t marry my wife, father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph lifted an eyebrow at him, &#34;Delia is your wife, Basil. You divorced Laura barely an hour before her death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips twitched, &#34;That was a mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And often we must learn to live with the mistakes we make. In this, you have to let it go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to let it go. I can&#39;t let go. You don&#39;t understand-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do,&#34; Adolph said solemnly. &#34;Laura was a good woman and you mistreated her. You let your ego blind and control you. You pushed her away and now you regret it. You want me to back out because you think it will give you a chance, but Laura is dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Laurel--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And even if she was alive, she has no interest in trying again with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know that. You don&#39;t know Laura.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You married again before her grave had settled. No good woman with a modicum amount of self-respect would forgive that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But father--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have nothing to say to you about it. Your relationship with Laura has nothing to do with my relationship with Laurel. If you truly believe that Laurel is Laura reincarnated, the least you can do after treating her the way you did is to wish her well, stand aside, and let her be happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil looked up at his father. The words of denial and refusal burned on his tongue, hot and angry, urging him to say something to get him to change his mind.  His father didn&#39;t understand. He&#39;d had years to get over Olivia. Whatever lingering respect and attachment he could have had for his late mother had long since died. Basil had only had a few months to come to terms with Laura&#39;s death before Laurel had shown up at the castle with Adolph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the look in his father&#39;s eyes said that there wasn&#39;t much else to be said about it. Adolf would not back down and Basil had no means to fight him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You are nothing*, she&#39;d said to him. *I care not what happens to you.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil clenched his jaw. Adolf pat him on the shoulder with a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One day, son, you will make peace with what your arrogance cost you. After that, I have a feeling you will find a woman who will give you the same happiness that Laurel gives me.&#34; Their gaze met, &#34;If you cannot find it in yourself to watch as I marry Laurel, I will understand if you do not attend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing. Was his father asking him to stay out of the ceremony? Was it a trick? He shook it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will go,&#39;&#39; Basil said calmly. &#34;You are my father and my king. It is my duty to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph was impressed. He poured a glass of whiskey and gave it to Basil with a soft smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All wounds heal,&#34; Adolf said. &#34;The pain that lingers is just a reminder of a lesson that should have been learned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called the rest of the party back inside and poured them each a glass. With a cheer of congratulations, they headed to the ballroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil stood off to the side in silence, his head down and his eyes troubled. Delia came to stand beside him when Laurel and the rest of the women entered. He watched Laurel cross the room like an ancient bride out of a history book to join his father in the center of the room. Adolf took her hand, they removed their shoes at the door and led the procession out towards the temple as his heart clenched with grief.</p>
