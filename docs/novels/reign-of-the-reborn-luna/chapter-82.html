                <p>The roses were beautiful and vibrant in the dreary graveyard. The headstone had been polished and the grave had been refilled with fresh dirt and made to look neat. The sight eased something in Basil, but he still didn&#39;t know why he was there looking at Laura&#39;s grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grief? Guilt? Some misplaced sense of regret? Wasn&#39;t he happy? Hadn&#39;t he told her that she meant nothing to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest felt tight at the memory. Her shocked expression, the tears in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;You are nothing,&#34; he&#39;d told her.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*She lowered her head. Her jaw trembled. Resignation and confusion rippled across her expression. Her shoulders began to relax into a defeated slump. He&#39;d been a little thrilled to see it.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He winced thinking back to that night and rubbing the back of his neck. He&#39;d felt powerful and on top of the world with Delia on his arm and looking down at Laura in her plain dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;I care not what happens to you after our divorce.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew now it was a lie, but he turned away from the grave and kept walking. He didn&#39;t want to think about Laura or Laurel or anything else, yet it was all he could think about these days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wolf was content to remain silent most of the time, but when he thought of Laura, he stood to attention and made his displeasure known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he was so unhappy about it, why hadn&#39;t he said anything that night? Why had it taken her death and all of this time since then to get him to speak up about it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Now, get out of my castle.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deep breath at the surge of guilt that went through him. She wouldn&#39;t have been dead if she&#39;d remained in the castle. Even if he&#39;d had her packed up and sent away by carriage or caravan, she would have been alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. It wasn&#39;t his fault she went running off into the forest. It wasn&#39;t his fault she&#39;d fallen over the cliff and ended up dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone cried out, startling him from his thoughts about Laura. He froze at the edge of the training grounds as a group of knights laughed and a young man was pulled to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A little more power on your left and you&#39;ll have it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me try again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The older soldier laughed, &#34;Take a break, kid. Next up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked over to the official entrance to the training pitch where the platform was. He could almost see himself and Laura standing there, watching the training one day early in their marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;I bet His Highness is very handy with a sword,&#34; Laura said, her eyes sparkling as she watched the training exercises. &#34;I hope you&#39;ll allow me to watch when you&#39;re on the pitch sometimes&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*His pride had been struck and he sneered at her, &#34;Why would a prince lower himself to train on a pitch with common soldiers?&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*She blinked, frowning before ducking her head, &#34;My apologies, Your Highness. I didn&#39;t mean to offend you.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered the sting of shame that had irritated him all day and made him leave her at the pitch. He avoided her for several days afterward until they were to have a formal dinner. The young man who had been thrown to the ground looked no older than Basil was, his eyes were bright. He was about as broad as Basil was but thicker as if he had substantially more muscle than Basil. Their eyes met for just a moment before the man seemed shocked. He nodded sharply and turned towards the resting bench.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned from the training pitch and headed back inside the castle. Delia was coming down the hallway, flushed, and heading straight for him when a knight called him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Highness,&#34; the knight said. &#34;If you could follow me. The Royal Beta, by order of His Majesty, has called for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia froze on her path and Basil nodded, turning to follow the man to Chasel&#39;s office. He&#39;d been inside a few times, but he couldn&#39;t remember ever being called there. It was on the floor just below his father and the luna&#39;s offices. The knight knocked. Chasel invited him in and he entered, lost for why he would be called and what Chasel could want.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel looked up, looking at Basil for a long while. He&#39;d known Basil his entire life, but he didn&#39;t think he had ever seen Basil so clearly as he did right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reports and testimonies he&#39;d gathered from the former and current staff were damning, but it wouldn&#39;t be enough in trial to satisfy the letter of the law and get the minister of general affairs dismissed and banished and start cornering Gavin into a corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit, Your Highness,&#34; Chasel said gesturing to the chair. &#34;I have quite a few questions to ask you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil frowned, eyeing the chair before sitting and meeting Chasel&#39;s gaze. Chasel pulled out a scroll of parchment and dipped his quill, seemingly preparing himself for an extensive interview.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When was the first day you had martial training?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil frowned, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Martial training, Your Highness. Your first day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never had martial training,&#34; Basil said. &#34;Why would I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel took note, &#34;We&#39;ll get to that. Are you aware of what the minister of general affairs is meant to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; take care of general affairs?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Commerce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The treasury.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Finance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Paperwork for withdrawals from the treasury,&#34; he hummed. &#34;Now that I think about it, I&#39;m not sure why there are both of them, considering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel took another note and tried not to wince as Basil talked about consolidating the two. It was obvious that the man didn&#39;t know that they were separate for a reason. He asked about the purpose of all the other ministers before moving on to other matters of the kingdom. His stomach turned with guilt and apprehension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want to tell his alpha and king that his only son had the socio-political understanding of a misinformed four-year-old. Unfortunately, it was his duty and he took note of all of Basil&#39;s responses to what he knew, what he was taught growing up, and who were his tutors before reaching a point where he didn&#39;t want to hear anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for your time, Your Highness,&#34; Chasel said, dusting the page to make sure it was dry before rolling the page up. He looked at Basil. &#34;I believe that&#39;s all I needed. Please enjoy your day. I think dinner will be served fairly soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil nodded and left. It was a strange conversation, but at least he wasn&#39;t being scolded and he&#39;d gotten to avoid Delia for a little while. He headed back towards his chambers, trying to think about what he should do about Delia, but he was grateful to see his grandfather coming around the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandfather,&#34; Basil greeted, smiling at him. The man flinched and hurried towards him before taking him by the arm and hurrying him down the hall into the minister of general affairs&#39; office. He frowned as Gavin turned to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did Chasel have to speak to you about?&#34; Gavin asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil shrugged, &#34;Nothing much. He asked some strange questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what?&#34; Gavin pressed, staring at him. &#34;It&#39;s important. What did he ask about? What did you tell him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil frowned at his grandfather, but he answered, all the same, going over the questions about the ministers and some other things that Chasel asked about, including the tribute from packs like Golden River.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you tell him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laura was against it and the tribute sent to her was still received and given to the nobles, as was right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin&#39;s lips twitched, regret and fear boiling in him. He hadn&#39;t thought about preparing Basil for these sorts of questions, so sure that Adolph and Chasel would die in battle. Between Laurel and Adolph&#39;s audit of the palace, there hadn&#39;t been any time to prepare his grandson not to give away all the information they didn&#39;t need Chasel to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he ask about the Mirabelle estate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Basil nodded. &#34;And others. Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you tell him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That you were very proud of the expanded west wing and&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin groaned, pushing his hands through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Basil asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at Basil, &#34;Did you not think to lie, Basil?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Did you not think?* Basil flinched at the sound of Laura&#39;s voice from the back of his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would I lie to Chasel?&#34; Basil asked. &#34;It would be like lying to my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin&#39;s eyes widened and he sighed, rubbing his head. He would have to figure out something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t let Chasel interview you again without talking to me first,&#34; Gavin hissed and turned to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil frowned as he left, leaving the door open behind him. His grandfather had never seemed so upset with him except for when he asked questions he shouldn&#39;t have. He had always been taught to be honest with his grandfather because lies were unbecoming of a prince. Why would he then expect him to lie to Chasel?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned and caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. For a moment, Laura appeared, shaking her head pitifully. He shuddered and turned to escape the room as fast as his legs would take him back to his quarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia wasn&#39;t there, thankfully. He closed the door of his bed-chamber and threw himself onto his bed with a sigh. His head was spinning. What was so important about Chasel&#39;s questions?</p>
