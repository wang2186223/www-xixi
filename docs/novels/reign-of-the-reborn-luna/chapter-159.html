                <p>Adolph turned to look at Eden down the hall, seated in an open window high above Adolph&#39;s head, silent and still. He hadn&#39;t even noticed Eden there. How had he gotten up there? Could he fly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had he been so silent? It was as if he was dead with no heartbeat to mark his presence or the whoosh of his breathing.</p>

                <p>&#34;When she was a girl, there was a garden down there,&#34; he pointed out to where Adolph had assumed a garden had been. &#34;The flowers were the first to die then the trees Then the rock turned black and the canals of blood began to dry up.&#34;</p>

                <p>Eden nodded, &#34;They feed the base of the protections on the castle. I think in Crystal Castle the protections were fed by the people who lived there.&#34;</p>

                <p>Eden nodded and his lips twitched, &#34;Morrigan&#39;s plan to rot the werewolf kingdom from the inside started long before Delia arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;... is this a part of those memories you were talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden nodded, &#34;It&#39;s a peculiar thing. Most vampires aren&#39;t strong enough to feel the memories of the people they drink from. Most people aren&#39;t strong enough to carry memories in their blood either Morrigan&#39;s memories are quite powerful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And it has nothing to do with you being her son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it had everything to do with it. Her memories, her blood, are speaking to mine. Informing it Enriching it in some way. I&#39;m certain there&#39;s not another vampire alive like me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden sighed and turned gliding down from his perch and landing soundlessly down the corridor from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to get to the heart of the castle,&#34; Eden said. &#34;The hearth if you will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To do what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father&#39;s curse and the poison of Morrigan&#39;s evil is centered there.&#34; Eden turned, &#34;We could have this done quickly. I can see that you&#39;re anxious to return to your capital city.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph narrowed his eyes, &#34;And what of everyone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged, &#34;Even if you brought them, they wouldn&#39;t be able to enter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph was wary of it, but he followed Eden down the hall. He wanted to go home as soon as possible. His wolf was restless thinking of Laurel alone back at the castle with whatever danger was lurking there, including Gavin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden led him down several hallways and a set of stairs. The air turned colder and muskier as if they were going somewhere that very few people had gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several doorways led to a room that had the same feeling as the heart of the garden behind the Crystal Castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this the Ash castle&#39;s garden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden approached a gate and opened it. The scent of poison and blood ebbed from the open doorway and Eden walked in. Adolph rested his hand on his sword and followed warily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was set up a great deal like the garden, but the stench of death was nearly overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the thick miasma, he nearly lost sight of Eden and cast his gaze around the room waiting for the man to attack him out of the mists, but all he heard was a soft gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph turned, searching the mists for Eden&#39;s figure before he found him standing at the edge of a dark pool. A near translucent figure of a man hovered above the placid surface. He looked a great deal like Eden, but older. He could have been Adolph&#39;s age, but he knew from Taliesin and Eden&#39;s anecdotes that he was much older.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I said run,&#34; his father began. &#34;I expected you to run away What were you thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I I can&#39;t answer that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph approached him to look at the man more clearly. He turned his gaze on Adolph with a calm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such an honor to meet one chosen by the moon. I hope my son hasn&#39;t caused you too much trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph&#39;s lips twitched, &#34;You&#39;re oddly agreeable for a dead man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caedan laughed, &#34;I was always agreeable. My son picked up his prickly attitude from his mother&#39;s family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His laughter died into something soft and wistful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suppose you&#39;re here to undo the curse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Eden said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caedan shook his head and gestured to the pool beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll have to cleanse the pools, but Morrigan&#39;s spirit remains here&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph clenched his jaw, &#34;What the hell does that mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden looked thoughtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s a wraith?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caedan nodded, &#34;I don&#39;t have the power to banish her I&#39;m barely keeping her away from you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden nodded and turned to Adolph, &#34;Give me your sword.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed and she offered it by the handle, ready to dart out of the way if he needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden whirled his finger and the sword turned upright in his hand. The blade vibrated with light before beginning to glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll need to be quick,&#34; Eden said, &#34;You&#39;ll know when.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph eyed him as Caedan looked at his son then nodded. The mists shifted, feeling like a shield around him as Eden turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A howling screech filled the air around them and Morrigan&#39;s voice thundered from the whirling air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You traitor!&#34; Her face appeared out of the mists, swiping at Eden. He stepped aside, drawing a blade seemingly from nowhere and blocking her attack before she vanished again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am your queen! Your goddess! You owe me everything you are!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden shoved her away from him and cast a blast of light at her. She shrieked and hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll pay for that, wretched boy!&#34; The wind picked up around him, lifting him into the air and slamming him into the far wall. &#34;I should have drained you when you were just a babe!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden choked as he slammed into the ground. He struggled to his feet, brandishing his knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a shot, he blew her back. His gray eyes turned a burning amber as his voice rose and echoed through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The placid pool around them lifted into the air in a rank cyclone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden whirled, thrusting a hand forward that blew the mists away, revealing Morrigan&#39;s spectral form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s impossible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re dead, Morrigan,&#34; Eden growled. &#34;And all dead must give way to the living.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morrigan charged just past Adolph as if she didn&#39;t see him. He sprinted forward, shoving his blade right through her chest. She choked and stumbled, reaching for the blade. Her head turned to face him. Her eyes widened, and she shrieked, disappearing into a shower of light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was oddly anticlimactic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she gone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mists vanished, revealing the stone details of the room, elegantly carved and darkened with evil. Caedan seemed to be fading as he faced them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re more powerful than I ever was,&#34; Caedan said thoughtfully. &#34;More powerful than my father too It must be the Ash blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does that mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caedan sighed, &#34;You know about your aunt, don&#39;t you? Morrigan drained her to death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden choked, wrapping a hand around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does that mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s such a taboo. Only to be done in the direst of circumstances She tried to take her power?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caedan nodded, &#34;And in doing so, she lost her own The moon goddess does not forgive the murder of kin&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden nodded, gravely, &#34;I understand that I was cursed as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caedan chuckled and stepped forward, placing his hands on Eden&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not believe that you are anything but blessed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden stiffened as Caedan drew back, &#34;The curse is simple. It was cast based on the broken bonds between our people. Wiccans and vampires, vampires and werewolves. In an allegiance between you two, it is undone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s all?&#39; Eden asked with a huff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would only work if Ash castle recognized you as its master,&#34; Caedan gestured to the pools. &#34;It came to your aid when you called.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph narrowed his eyes, &#34;You mean Eden will have to remain on the throne of the vampires for this to work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caedan smirked, &#34;The thrones of the moon are separate for a reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gestured to Eden, &#34;A child of the new moon and the sun Heir to the Ash and Emrys lines A convergence and you,&#34; he gestured to Adolph. &#34;The black wolf, the king of the children of the full moon. You were never meant to be at odds While my brother may take over the Wiccan Alliance when my father decides it is time for him to finally rest, you were always meant to reform these bonds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden looked at Adolph and offered his hand, &#34;I am willing if you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph eyed his hand, wondering if he had a choice given the state of the vampire lands and how little he knew about them. Would it be so bad to have Eden as an ally? At least, this Eden seemed more interested in fixing the wrongs of his mother than causing trouble for Adolph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if Eden was on the throne, he would have an ally who could compel every vampire into compliance. He could stay in the werewolf kingdom and not worry much about the people within the Ash lands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than all of that, Laurel would want him to strive for peace. He looked at his blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I needed to could I kill you with this blade?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden smiled, &#34;Consider it goodwill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph sheathed the glowing blade and shook Eden&#39;s hand.</p>
