                <p>The walk to the temple from the ballroom wasn&#39;t long, but it was very scenic. The path had been cleared of weeds and replanted with fresh paving stones to guide the way and new flowers that seemed more vibrant than any flower had the right to be after being planted less than a week prior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver, the gardener, had outdone himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you all right?&#34; Laurel looked up at Adolph. His expression was pensive and troubled. &#34;Are you feeling okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolf lifted her hand and kissed her knuckles, &#34;I am overjoyed. You look lovely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Somehow, temple wear suits you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think I can get away with wearing it all the time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I doubt it would do anything to lessen your very menacing reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel gassed as they rounded the corner and she got her first look at the temple. The columns looked new. She couldn&#39;t even tell that it had been in a state of disrepair. The steps gleamed as if they had been polished and were lined with moonstone that glinted a silvery-blue in the evening&#39;s light. The priestess was waiting at the altar with a knowing smile. She wasn&#39;t the priestess who had tried to marry them before, but she had similar features. She was older than Adolf and Raven. Laurel had a feeling that this was one of his aunts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked up the steps, she felt a sense of calm security was over her as if they were back at the main temple.  Upon a closer look, the altar was made of moonstone as well and carved with symbols filled with silver. She couldn&#39;t read the words, but she knew it was writing. It looked a great deal like some of the carvings that had been in the temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolf was impressed by how well they had restored the temple. Though he had expected nothing less of Henry and Dorian. As they turned towards each other, Adolf wondered if he could ever have another moment like this in which he felt completely at peace. He knew there was still trouble within his borders and that to feel any sort of security now put them all in danger, but he couldn&#39;t help but relax at the sight of her standing in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were getting married, and no power in the world would stop them this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The priestess&#39; words were different. They evoked an ancient feeling of reverence and importance and seemed imbued with the moon goddess&#39; presence. Adolph glanced at the priestess and found that her eyes glowed like moonlight and her smile seemed otherworldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the constituents and found them mostly in shock and awe at the sight. This was probably the best idea Raven had ever had, and he would have to remember to tell her so as soon as he and Laura were married and making their way back for the reception</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the moon goddess&#39; light, her grace and favor, I stand witness to the union of this couple. As does everyone here Do you swear before the moon goddess and all present to bear the burden of duty as king, mate, and alpha to the werewolf kingdom and your wife,  Laurel Miller?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you swear before the moon goddess and all present to bear the burden of duty as queen, mate, and Luna to the werewolf kingdom and your husband, His Majesty, King Adolph Raymond?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel smiled, &#34;I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By her grace, I present King Adolph Raymond and Luna Laurel Raymond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clapping and excitement filled the air as Adolf pulled Laurel close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may kiss your luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolf dipped his head to press their lips together, careful and tender before a prickle of awareness shot through her. Adolf pulled her aside as an arrow narrowly missed them and buried itself in the ground nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scream of shock went through the air as bodies descended on the congregation with a ferocious growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Return to the castle!&#34; Adolf ordered pushing Laurel back towards the altar. &#34;Laurel, stay here. You&#39;ll be safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel wanted to protest, but he shifted into his wolf form and leaped into the fray, defending an alpha from another pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More guards came up to help deal with the ambush but more werewolves kept coming. Where had they all come from? He didn&#39;t recognize any of them, but each of them seemed to be wearing nondescript clothing as if they were meant to just blend in with the servants and merchants in town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil was shoved out of the way by Henry, telling him to grab Delia and whoever else he could manage and head back to the castle where others were fleeing. He turned, searching for Delia though his wolf was uninterested in her safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Delia!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t seem to hear him, nor did she seem frightened. Maybe she was in shock but there was something about that thought that didn&#39;t sit right with him. Delia&#39;s eyes were focused, not watching any of the attackers,.but on the altar where Laurel and Adolf had stood moments before. Her lips twitched as a man began to run up behind the altar towards Laurel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil hurried to her to grab her by her arm, &#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia turned back but allowed him to drag her towards the entrance of the castle without fuss. Something nagged him in the back of his mind, but he didn&#39;t pay much attention to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel stumbled as a werewolf crept up behind her. She turned as a man grabbed her and yanked her back and away from the altar. The priestess stepped back with her hands raised and her mouth open in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel twisted, drawing her dagger out of its sheath and shoving the man back hard. He didn&#39;t release her and dragged her back away from the altar until she could feel the sense of peace and protection vanish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed for the dagger, but she was faster avoiding his hand and slicing the arm that held her. He cried out in pain and released her. She turned back to the altar and ran around the side towards the fray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard him following her and turned to be ready to drive the dagger into his chest when Adolph roared and leaped over her head onto the attacker. The man barely managed to cry out before the snap of his neck echoed through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolf shifted back into his human form. His robes were covered in dirt and blood, but he seemed unharmed. The scuffling of the guards and the attacker died down. She turned around and found that the guards far outnumbered the attackers now and had subdued the remaining werewolves who survived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assumed they would attack at the wedding, so I made sure there were enough guards to deal with any sort of force.&#34; He turned to Chasel. &#34;How many were injured? Dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;10 wounded,  5 dead: all attackers&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was better than he expected. He smirked, &#34;So, it looks like you haven&#39;t been letting them go soft.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel scoffed, &#34;As if I would ever want to face your wrath if I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get them into chains and to the dungeons within the hour. Bring me the leader if you can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel rushed off to do his bidding as Adolph turned to Laurel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you all right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded and she sheathed her dagger, &#34;I&#39;m okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems like your training has come in handy. I was a bit concerned that you&#39;d freeze up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took his hand, &#34;I said I would stand at your side and fight for the werewolf Kingdom. I meant that. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolf smirked, &#34;I don&#39;t intend for you to have enough energy to fight so soon after our wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel&#39;s face burned with embarrassment, &#34;Your Majesty!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled her close with a little growl of discontent, &#34;We&#39;re married now, wife. Can&#39;t you call me by my name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel trembled looking up at him and nodded, &#34;Adolf, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Later,&#34; he said and pressed a quick kiss to her cheek. &#34;For now, we figure out what we can then head to the festivities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel returned, dragging a man with him, &#34;Here&#39;s the one giving the orders at least.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolf glared down at the man, taking stock of him and trying to place him in his memory. He didn&#39;t recognize the man from Eden&#39;s caravan or anywhere really. It would have been nice to be able to point to that later, but he supposed Eden and whoever was behind the attack, was a bit too smart for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were werewolves. Likely rogues who either had lost their mates or had been banished from their packs for one reason or another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolf crouched, grabbing the man by his throat, and pulled him closer to meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have an opportunity to save your life and the lives of your comrades. Who sent you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolf waited for the man to speak, staring into his eyes. A flicker of defiance went through his eyes before the man opened his mouth and spat in Adolph&#39;s face.</p>
