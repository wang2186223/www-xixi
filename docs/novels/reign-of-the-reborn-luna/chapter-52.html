                <p>Adolph hadn&#39;t known what kissing Laurel would do to him. Heat rushed through him, the need to mark her was near overwhelming, but he restrained himself, pulling back before he got lost in her scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to mark you with the door open.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel gasped, her eyes widened as she pulled away from him. Her face was bright red. He almost winced at his words. That probably wasn&#39;t the best thing to say, but he meant it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should close the door then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph&#39;s heart leaped looking down at Laurel who couldn&#39;t meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She huffed and glared up at him, &#34;If I have to repeat myself, I&#39;m leaving!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph moved before he had fully realized what she&#39;d said, dashing around the desk to close and lock the door as if she would find a way to escape. His wolf was growling, urging him to hurry up, but he looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was nervous, he expected her to be, but she wasn&#39;t afraid. Laurel stared at him across the room, watching him as he approached her slowly. She let out a little squeak of surprise as he cupped her face and kept a firm grip on his control. His wolf was howling, pushing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t hurt much,&#34; Adolph said stiffly, his voice seemed rougher than he intended and his heart was racing. Her eyes widened, seemingly shocked at his tone. &#34;Just relax, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded her head and closed her eyes. Her trust in him shook something in him. The sight of his hands, the same that had killed hundreds if not thousands, cupping her delicate face seemed so wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Mark her*, his wolf urged. *Hurry up!*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carefully, he lowered his head, nuzzling her a bit and taking in her sweet scent before dragging his teeth against her neck. She trembled. Her hands shot up to grip the fabric of his shirt as he pressed her against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash of movement, he sunk his teeth into her shoulder. The ripple of pleasure made him shudder and pull her closer as their bond formed. He felt almost dizzy with want and primal need. He lifted her onto his desk with a groan and rolled his hips against hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel cried out. Her eyes fluttered. The pain was sharp, but quickly, overtaken by the rush of pleasure that made her toes curl as she moaned. Alice howled as Adolph drew back, licking the mark. The rasp of his tongue made her shiver. He growled and pressed a kiss against her neck and kissed his way up her neck until he reached her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kiss was nothing like the sweet little kiss they&#39;d shared earlier. She felt his wolf howling and reaching for her, his need washed over her as he pinned her to the desk and groaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moaned as he ground their hips together and took her mouth with such a possessive passion that she was breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Your Majesty,&#34; she gasped, turning her head to try and breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grunted against her neck, shuddering and holding himself still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he rasped. &#34;I I didn&#39;t&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I I don&#39;t think,&#34; Laurel stammered. &#34;I-I think we should&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph pulled back. His face flushed as he looked down at her. His eyes were near glowing with his desire. She could barely breathe and the air seemed to sing between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Basil had marked her, she had barely felt anything. She hadn&#39;t known that it could feel like that. His chest heaved as he forced himself to breathe. His erection was pressed against her, making it impossible to ignore how much it had affected him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She covered her face, &#34;I&#39;m not ready!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph closed his eyes, taking a calming breath before leaning over to press a kiss to her forehead. His wolf had never felt so calm though he was anything but.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He withdrew from her slowly and backed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand,&#34; Adolph said roughly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel sat up slowly and slid off the desk. He offered her his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me escort you back to your office?&#34; Adolph said, though he wanted to escort her to his bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded stiffly and placed her hand in his. He shuddered at the zing of pleasure that went through him as they touched and escorted her to her office next door. She slipped inside with a little murmur of goodbye and Adolph leaned against the door trying to gain control of himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side of the door, Laurel sunk to the floor with her back pressed against the door. Her heart pounded in her chest and her head was spinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marked, she thought. She couldn&#39;t help but smile even as her eyes burned. He&#39;d marked her as his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ring on her finger meant they would be married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t his love exactly, but it was enough for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel didn&#39;t see Adolph again for the rest of the day. She wasn&#39;t sure if she appreciated it or not. Alice didn&#39;t seem to care either way, reveling in their bond. She could feel him still in the castle. She could even tell, roughly, how far away he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew that he&#39;d walked past her bedroom after she&#39;d retired for the evening too. Alice had nearly dragged her from bed to see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the morning, Sarah was glowing with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His Majesty has invited you for breakfast in the garden!&#34; Sarah squealed, gesturing to a large box. &#34;He sent this for you. Up! Up! Up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel chuckled, sitting up as Sarah bounded around the room getting things together. She stopped, nearly tripping over her gown, as her eyes locked on the mark on Laurel&#39;s shoulder. She blinked, blinked, and blinked again before rushing over to her with a squeal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, congratulations!&#34; Sarah cried, throwing her arms around Laurel&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel sighed and hugged her back, &#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah pulled away, &#34;I&#39;ll have to do your hair extra fancy today!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel laughed and let Sarah do as she pleased. The curls were familiar, reminiscent of a style she&#39;d worn for events as Laura with something different about the arrangement. She liked it. It looked royal and fitting of the future wife of a king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sam and Lynn grinned at her but said nothing as they escorted her to the garden&#39;s gates where Adolph waited in casual clothes and a sword on his belt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked young and charming with his hair blowing in the breeze, like a young knight coming to see his love. He smiled at her, his eyes lit up and he walked towards her to take her hand gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good Morning, Laurel,&#34; he said as she trembled at the rush of emotion his touch brought her. Her heart was singing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shall we?&#34; Adolph asked, gesturing ahead of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel was nearby holding a large basket and grinning. Lily smiled warmly at them holding a large blanket in her arms. Adolph took the basket with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel bowed and hurried off. Lily gave the blanket to Laurel and hurried off after her cousin with a little giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel wondered what they knew that she didn&#39;t, but she walked arm in arm with Adolph into the garden. When she was Laura, she had only seen the very outer sections of the garden, though she was responsible for making sure the entire garden was kept in pristine condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From some of the rooms of the castle, she could see into the garden. They walked beyond the outer hedges and the second layer and her heart trembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They passed a large stone archway and approached a golden gate that gleamed in the sunlight. Around it, red roses bloomed on the outer wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roses. She winced a bit. This place had probably been Olivia&#39;s favorite part of the garden. Maybe it was her garden. She didn&#39;t remember if the luna ever had a garden for herself. It hadn&#39;t mattered to Laura since she had the orchard to look after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we going?&#34; Laurel asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Into the Raymond sanctuary,&#34; he said softly. &#34;Do you know what that is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. She&#39;d heard of it in passing by Basil as a place she would never be worthy enough to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the innermost section of the royal garden.&#34; Adolph said, &#34;Very few have ever been inside, and it&#39;s kept by only the Imperial Gardener.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Laurel asked as he pulled a key from his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s also called the Heart of the Kingdom.&#34; He unlocked the gate and opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel gasped as he led her inside. No roses grew there. In their place, white lunar flowers with almost silver petals and lush red azaleas decorated the area. The pond was clear and connected to a river that flowed into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph led her to the center of the garden after closing the gate behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you bring me here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled, &#34;Because every king shares breakfast with his mate here the morning after the marking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set the basket nearby, &#34;It&#39;s about time I get a chance to enjoy the tradition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did that mean? She turned from that thought and didn&#39;t answer, spreading the blanket out so they could sit and share breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled her closer to him and seemed so happy to be there with her that she couldn&#39;t think of anything else but how happy she was there to be with him too.</p>
