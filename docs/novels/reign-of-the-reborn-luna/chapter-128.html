                <p>She was nervous, pacing the little parlor of his rooms. While he had her things moved into the queen&#39;s rooms, she hadn&#39;t spent much time in them. She held the drafts of the birth announcements that Raven had the royal calligrapher create for them. They wouldn&#39;t be going out until the baby had arrived, but it was the best way to tell Adolph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel?&#34; She stopped and turned as Adolph entered the room with a surprised expression. &#34;What are you doing here? It&#39;s almost dinnertime.&#34;</p>

                <p>His tone set a flush in her cheeks and lowered her gaze, &#34;Yes Though I have something to tell you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph frowned, flinching as he eyed her, &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel startled, shaking her head and drawing closer, &#34;Nothing bad. I promise. Sit down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph sunk onto the couch and she sat beside him. She set the drafts in front of him, but his eyes widened at the first one she placed in front of him. He didn&#39;t watch her set the others down as he turned to stare at her in abject shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled at him happily, &#34;You can&#39;t choose one if you&#39;re-!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph pulled her close, sealing their lips together. He cupped her face gently, slipping his tongue between her lips as she smiled against his mouth and enjoyed the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel,&#34; he said roughly. &#34;Tell me Tell me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Laurel said. &#34;I&#39;m I&#39;m pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes seemed to water as he pulled her close again, rocking her with a little laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no idea how happy I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, &#34;I&#39;m warning you in advance that I&#39;ll be eating a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have all the steak and jam you want, darling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed and it lifted into the air above their heads, ringing through the room. His warmth and joy filled her, completely grounding her in the moment and taking her breath away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach growled again and he laughed, &#34;I I should get you some more food. I&#39;ll be back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jumped to his feet, his eyes jumping to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed, &#34;Adolph they&#39;re bringing dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not coming fast enough. I&#39;ll be back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head as he dashed towards the door and out with a laugh. She leaned back shaking her head at his antics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph hurried to find the cart that was meant for his rooms and ran into Basil. He grinned, grabbing his son by the shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dear son,&#34; Adolph said. Basil&#39;s eyes widened, shocked at his father&#39;s antics. &#34;You will soon know the joys of being an older sibling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil&#39;s eyes widened in shock and horror. He froze in place. Adolph laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry! You won&#39;t drop the child. You&#39;ll have plenty of tutelage,&#34; He chuckled, &#34;Besides, it&#39;s not as hard as you&#39;d think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of a cart rolling towards them caught Basil&#39;s attention. His father said something and hurried down the hallway. Basil stood stock still and turned. The little high of having contributed to the conversation went flat and his stomach plummeted as he turned and headed back to his quarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grandfather was standing outside, looking upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basil, I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not now, grandfather,&#34; Basil said with a groan and brushed past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basil, you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the door and found Delia there on his couch. Basil let out a frustrated sigh. He didn&#39;t want to deal with Delia right now, but it seemed he didn&#39;t have a choice. He sat on the couch and propped up his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sibling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil had never wanted a sibling, never considered having one. He wished there was a bottle of alcohol, but he didn&#39;t even have the energy to order a servant to bring him one. Maybe he could just sit and disappear. Maybe if he ignored them both they&#39;d get the hint and go away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basil!&#34; Gavin cried and he sighed again before sitting up and looking at Gavin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it, grandfather?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You- You! In the meeting, what kind of foolish-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was right. You were wrong,&#34; Basil said evenly. &#34;You&#39;re not even a real minister. Why should I have ever listened to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin&#39;s jaw dropped, &#34;What What has gotten into you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil bared his teeth, &#34;Maybe I&#39;m tired. Maybe I&#39;m sick and tired of you trying to control me- No. I am tired of letting you control me. It was a good idea-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basil-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father approved of it. Everyone else at the table agreed with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone with real power and experience agreed with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basil! I will not allow you to talk to me like this after all I&#39;ve done for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil scoffed, &#34;What do you want, grandfather? What did you come here to talk to me about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin stammered, unable to fathom what had happened that Basil would speak to him like this, but he cleared his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should have spoken to me in private first, Basil. Have I not guided you all this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Basil said, shaking his head. &#34;You&#39;ve controlled me all this time. I should have listened to Laura all those times she said you were just looking to use me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia flinched, &#34;Laura-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to talk to you either, Delia,&#34; he said through gritted teeth. &#34;Not about Laura. Not about the baby. Not about anything. I would like to be left alone, but I can&#39;t seem to find any peace. Not even in my apartments!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at them both, &#34;Am I the crown prince or some commoner that you can just barge into my rooms like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia looked up at him, &#34;I&#39;m your wife, alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil rolled his eyes at her and she gasped. He looked at Gavin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what&#39;s your excuse, grandfather?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What baby?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel is pregnant. Father is ecstatic,&#34; Basil hissed. &#34;Now, if you would both get out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia stood quickly and left. Gavin stumbled after her. Basil closed the door in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin heard Delia hurrying down the hall to her rooms, but he stood in the hallway shocked at Basil&#39;s words. Of course, he was right, but he hadn&#39;t expected his oh-so trusting grandson to notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he had never expected Adolph&#39;s new wife to be pregnant so soon after they were married. It took months before Olivia had fallen pregnant. He grunted. He supposed the frequency at which they had sex made all the difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wouldn&#39;t do at all for his plans. If they had a child, the child would have a more legitimate claim to the throne than Basil. The little bit of power he had through Basil would vanish, and as soon as that child was born, his ceremonial position would be tenuous at best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was already barely avoiding being confined to his estate because his position allowed him to attend all meetings of state and he was still under constant observation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knight who was assigned to him stood at the end of the hall, watching him quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel could not carry that child to term, though it would be best if she were dead or rendered unable to ever bear children again. He turned down the hallway. Basil was upset now because of the news, but when he was on the throne, he would turn to Gavin for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been playing too lightly all this time, it seemed. With all these changes happening, it was best to step up his game. He needed Laurel and her unborn spawn dead. He needed Adolph off the throne and to get Basil on it long before he had a chance to think much more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only question was how he was going to accomplish all of that with so few allies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia closed the door behind her and screamed, shoving over the bedside table so it clattered to the floor. That little bitch had managed to get pregnant far quicker than Delia had anticipated. She should have listened to Eden back when Basil was fully under the spell and gotten pregnant to secure her position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t have half a chance if Laurel had her child. Those nobles knew enough about the Raymond family&#39;s traditions to be trusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was she going to do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Eden was here, she would have an idea, some direction, but she was alone and all she could do was think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a small advantage that Laurel was trying to teach her to write. If perhaps she used their meetings to her advantage and lured her into trusting her a bit more, then maybe she would have a chance to get rid of her secrecy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. If Adolph knew that she was pregnant, he&#39;d be even more protective of her than ever. She wouldn&#39;t be able to step foot out of their rooms without some sort of escort. Delia chewed her nails and sunk onto the couch, rocking and trying to come up with a plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to get rid of Laurel. *Fast.*</p>
