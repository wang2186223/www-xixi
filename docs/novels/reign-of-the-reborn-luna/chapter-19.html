                <p>Basil didn&#39;t ask anything else and they finished dessert in silence. Adolph ushered her from the dining room. They walked for a while before she asked her where her room had been moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-Why?&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;The blue guest suite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled and led her through the corridors towards the guest suites. It was still a bit grating, but she was getting used to his high-handed tactics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if you had been put in a maid&#39;s room again? I would never let my mate sleep in a place like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel&#39;s face burned with embarrassment. She wanted to tell him she wasn&#39;t his mate, but Alice&#39;s growl of contentment was threatening to escape if she said anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was very happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you came to the dining room, you ran straight to me&#34; His voice turned low and sultry, making her heart race. &#34;You smelled great, and your face was like a red apple, tempting me to take a bite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he flirting with her? Laurel tries not to stiffen up or pull away. She wanted to be angry even as Alice was overflowing with happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I wasn&#39;t trying to tempt--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you notice? Your eyes were only on me. You didn&#39;t seem to see anyone in the room. Actions of our subconscious show us how we really feel&#34; He looked at her, holding her captive with his gaze. &#34;Does this mean that you don&#39;t actually want to reject me as much as you seem to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Of course not!* Alice cried. *Why would we ever reject such a--*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel averted her gaze, &#34;I-I didn&#39;t I was just afraid I was late, and&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced back at him and found him smiling tenderly and with a little amusement like he was looking at a little girl trying to make excuses after she thought she made a mistake. It was strangely indulgent though not condescending. She didn&#39;t know what else to say or how to navigate most of their interactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph was so mature and assured of himself. He didn&#39;t need to push off his issues on her, yet he drew her in with every word and smile. He knew just how to tease her to fluster her but not offend her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was she supposed to resist? She had no defense against him. She had only dealt with men like Lucas and Basil before: a lecherous jerk just looking for a pretty woman to sleep with or a jerk who treats his wife like a sister who is meant to feed, clothe, and wipe her little brother&#39;s ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said she was tempting him, but he was the one tempting her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax. I won&#39;t force you to make a decision. I promised you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah was cleaning the room when they arrived. She stumbled, startled by Laurel entering with Adolph behind her. She seemed nervous before she quickly dropped into a curtsey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome back, Miss Laurel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Sarah Could you leave me for the night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, Miss. Have a good night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She curtsied again and left them alone, closing the door behind her as she left. Laurel turned to Adolph and found him looking around the room. Though he was usually very stoic, his face showed his discontent with the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;... There are better rooms in the castle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel shook her head and tried not to be offended, given Laura&#39;s hard work on this room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is nicer than the other guest rooms, but&#34; Adolph huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel scoffed. What was he suggesting? That she should move into the *luna&#39;s* suites. She shuddered at the thought. She had never lived in that suite as Tina had never opened it for her and Basil had never made mention of it.  She had never felt worthy to live in them anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her room as Basil&#39;s wife had been lavish, but she never wanted to live in that suite again. Gold lined every surface. The windows were made of fine stained glass, and every inch of it was meant to dazzle and show the wealth and power of the werewolf kingdom. It was a princess&#39; room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was luxurious, but it was just a prison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like this room very much,&#34; Laurel said and she lifted her head. &#34;Also, I&#39;ve been thinking about Sam and all the soldiers and civilians who lost their mates during the war. I hope to help them find their second chance mate as soon as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph nodded, &#34;I&#39;ve been thinking about it as well. You have an idea, I take it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart fluttered and she nodded, excited and hopeful, grateful that he seemed interested in listening to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not hold a mating ceremony? All the young wolves who are not yet mated can participate, of course, so we won&#39;t miss anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph looked at her thoughtfully and smiled, &#34;Your father taught you well. He would have been proud to see you like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel shied away from his attention, &#34;I-It&#39;s just a suggestion Though the sooner the mating ceremony is held the better. Ba-- I mean, Prince Basil&#39;s wedding is coming soon, so it will have to be delayed--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph shook his head, &#34;You don&#39;t need to worry about that, I have a solution.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel was curious about what he had in mind, but eventually, she nodded. A few moments of silence passed with them looking at one another and his scent filling her senses. She struggled to keep Alice quiet in her mind and gave him an awkward smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-Well, Your Majesty. It&#39;s late,&#34; She walked to the door. &#34;The long journey must have exhausted you, I hope you have a good rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a little giddy about his reassurances and the scent of him filling the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You as well, Laurel,&#34; Adolph said and stepped towards her. The warmth of his lips on her forehead made her shiver with tenderness and wanting. She leaned forward, closing her eyes as he began to draw away before catching herself and hoping he hadn&#39;t noticed. &#34;Good night, my mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph opened the door and left. He had turned the corner before Laurel brought a hand up to her forehead in disbelief and wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that a goodnight kiss? Her father hadn&#39;t even given her a goodnight kiss! Her forehead still felt warm as she closed the door and leaned against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice howled and squealed her happiness, and even Laurel had to smile at the gesture. Her heart was still racing as she changed for bed and crawled into bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slept longer than she thought she would and woke up as Sarah was setting up breakfast in the attached parlor. She was diligent, but it was clear she wanted to ask something. She wrung her hands and Laurel chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it, Sarah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mean to be rude, Miss Laurel, but who was that man yesterday?&#34; She looked troubled. &#34;I&#39;ve never seen him before...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was King Adolph Raymond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah gasped, slapping her hands to her cheeks in shock, &#34;Oh, my! I&#39;ve heard he&#39;s terrifying!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t wrong but Laurel smiled, &#34;Sometimes, but he&#39;s a very good king. He helped me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah frowned and Laurel invited her to sit with her. Sarah sat hesitantly and listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father, Jack, died to protect the king. I don&#39;t have any other family. King Adolph brought me back to the Imperial City.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah nodded, &#34;I&#39;m so surprised. That&#39;s nothing like what I&#39;ve heard of him And I thought for sure you were some sort of noble&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just an ordinary girl like you. You are my first friend in my castle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a bit bittersweet to say. Sarah had always been her first friend. As luna, she hadn&#39;t been able to tell Sarah that due to the difference in station, but she&#39;d tried to show it as much as possible. As Laurel, she was free to befriend Sarah because they were both just commoners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah&#39;s eyes glimmered with tears and they spilled down her cheeks, &#34;I-I I don&#39;t know why, miss, but you remind me of&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel&#39;s heart sped up in fear, but she asked, calmly, &#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The former luna, Laura, Prince Basil&#39;s late wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she given herself away somehow, or was it just her general demeanor? Perhaps it was just her appearance? Regardless, since they were on the topic of Laura, maybe she could get some information from Sarah about what happened after she died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know she died. King Adolph seemed furious about what happened to her,&#34; she worried her lip, hoping her act was convincing. &#34;Would you tell me what happened to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah let out a broken sob and buried her face in her hand, &#34;She died in an accidental fall off a cliff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel was not surprised that was all she knew. She doubted anyone besides her, the goddess, and the killer knew she&#39;d been murdered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did they find the body?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah nodded as she wiped her eyes, &#34;She was the nicest person I&#39;ve ever met, but Prince Basil buried her with the commoners and didn&#39;t even give her a good funeral! He said he was ashamed of her, even the way she died How could he say that? My poor luna, her parents did not even come to attend her funeral.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel immediately sat up straight as a strike of apprehension tore through her. Of course, her *parents*! She didn&#39;t expect them to be so heartless as to not even come to their daughter&#39;s funeral, no matter how they broke off their relationship. Did they hate her so much in the end?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Why* hadn&#39;t they paid their last respects? Her stomach churned nervously. The thought was powerful, the fear that followed even more so, but she tried to push it away, but it resisted her effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could her parents have shoved their ungrateful daughter off a cliff as revenge?</p>
