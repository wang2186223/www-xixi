                <p>Chasel groaned, &#34;The king accepted the invitation of some packs and went to inspect the kingdom at noon yesterday. He was not in the city. I didn&#39;t know what happened until Sam told me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel averted her gaze. It wasn&#39;t as bad as she thought, but was it good enough to go back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you talk to me?&#34; Chasel pressed. &#34;I would have stopped this. It&#39;s obviously not your fault. When the king returns, he will punish them for all this, but--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel shook her head, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Chasel, but I&#39;m not going back.&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve had some time to think about it,&#34; Laurel said and wrung her hands nervously. &#34;It&#39;s not appropriate. I was invited by the king to stay in the castle, but no explanation has been given for it.&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;People are gossiping that I seduced the king.&#34; Chasel gasped in horror. &#34;I didn&#39;t come here to be the king&#39;s mistress!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel regarded her for a moment before he seemed to agree. His shoulders slumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you really not going back? But-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m not going back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice thrashed in her chest and her heart clenched as Chasel groaned again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His Majesty will be furious&#34; Laurel wasn&#39;t sure if he was saying that as a bid to get her to change her mind or to himself as he thought of telling Adolph that she wasn&#39;t coming back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel met her gaze and she refused to look away. He sighed and rubbed the back of his neck with a grimace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen. You are welcome to return to the castle anytime you wish, Laurel. I&#39;m sorry that such unfortunate things have happened to you. I will inform His Majesty of your decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chasel left with a little bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay, Laurel?&#34; Eden asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; she assured. &#34;Just tired. Thank you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She escaped Eden&#39;s presence as quickly as she could and closed the door behind her, thankful that Sarah had chosen to spend more time with Sam. Her head pounded making her vision a bit blurry. It could have been that she had too much alcohol, so she decided to get into bed to try and sleep it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Don&#39;t call her luna!&#34; Basil snarled as the darkness cleared to the area outside the dancing hall. &#34;She doesn&#39;t deserve that title! Seize her!&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Again, she was dreaming of it. She didn&#39;t want to, but the dream held fast, forcing her to look at Basil&#39;s expression.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*His voice was almost happy as he smirked at her, &#34;I told you. I will do as I please. You are not even fit to be a spare maid in my castle. Now, get out of my castle.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*She turned from the sight, but instead of more darkness, she stood in the blue guest suite. Her things had been pulled out of the drawers and thrown out.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Delia stood in the center of the room with Tina.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;I am luna and I have the right to do whatever I want,&#34; Delia yelled. &#34;I will not tolerate the presence of someone as rude as you! Now, get out of my castle!&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Delia&#39;s voice echoed, sending the forest rushing by her as if she were running through the forest again until she reached the edge of the cliff.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*The wind blew cold around her and down into the canyon, carrying with it the scents of the orchard and maybe the hint of rich wine swirling around in a noble&#39;s glass.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Not here.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Not here.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*She tried to back away when the cold hand shoved her forward and sent her plummeting into the ravine below.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel sat up with a scream as she crashed onto the floor. She shuddered and tried to calm her breathing. It was just a nightmare, a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold sweat trickled down her back and forehead as she struggled to her knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dream meant something. Her instincts were telling her something. Maybe she had been right to suspect Delia or Basil in the first place. The need to know, the need for justice burned hot in her chest and she groaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been kicked out of the castle, but she couldn&#39;t give up her investigation. She couldn&#39;t leave the Imperial City until she knew for sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be Delia? She didn&#39;t see why it would be. Delia was Basil&#39;s mate, and Basil loved her so much that she didn&#39;t need to be jealous of Laura. Even without killing her, Delia would have become Luna sooner or later. Killing her just seemed like overkill. She hadn&#39;t done anything to make an enemy out of her either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, it was more likely Basil if it were one of them or someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands trembled in the darkness of the room. It was late, but Sarah hadn&#39;t returned yet. She was almost grateful for the chance to pull herself together. Her heart was racing and she felt too wired to try to go back to bed just yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked over to the other side of the bed as emotions and thoughts swirled like a rushing river through her. Loneliness settled quickly in her heart. At least, if Sarah were here she would have had something to distract her from her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She washed her face and changed for bed before climbing back into bed, hoping she wouldn&#39;t end up staring at the ceiling all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel woke the next morning with no recollection of when or how she fell asleep.  She felt terrible, but she forced herself out of bed while Sarah was getting dressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good Morning, Laurel!&#34; Sarah said. &#34;How&#39;d you sleep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not very well.&#34; Laurel shook her head, running her hand through her hair. &#34;It was just a nightmare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned and gave her a sympathetic smile, &#34;I&#39;m sorry Let&#39;s hope there&#39;s something tasty for breakfast, hm? Maybe we can go out into the city today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded and got ready. They got downstairs and sat for breakfast. Eden wasn&#39;t there. She assumed he was off handling merchant business, but the family sitting beside them caught her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A father, mother, and daughter were sharing a meal, laughing and chatting. From their clothing, they were werewolves from a nearby pack that had come for the celebrations in the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, we should come back for the next festival!&#34; The daughter said. &#34;I definitely want to eat more tasty food and see the castle and&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her parents seemed indulgent and a bit amused by her excitement. It was clear that they were planning to go home now that the celebrations were over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pang of envy filled Laurel as she thought of Laura&#39;s parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s parents! How had she forgotten about them? They were likely in the Imperial City. They were snobbish in her past life, and they loved celebrations and parties with nobles more than anything but money. They wouldn&#39;t have missed this celebration if they could help it. They were the second hands of the alpha and he had definitely received an invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could they have been the ones who killed her? She shied away from the thought because of how much it hurt, but it was a possibility. Even if they weren&#39;t involved with her death, she wanted to see them at least one more time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe seeing how they mourned her would make the burdens of Laura&#39;s life seem lesser and inspire her to continue pursuing justice. Did they regret having a daughter? Had they changed at all? Maybe they were here to try and take her body back to the pack?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up and turned to Sarah anxiously, &#34;Would you do me a favor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember Luna Laura&#39;s parents?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Sarah scowled, &#34;They are a very nasty couple...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think they might be in the city for the celebration. They&#39;ll likely be staying at an inn as well, and I&#39;d like to ask you to look for them with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah frowned, &#34;Sure. But, Laurel, why are you looking for them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel was a little flustered. She didn&#39;t have much of a reason that would make sense, so she hoped her excuse would make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well... I had a dream yesterday that I became luna and was driven out of the castle. I woke up horrified. The poor woman! I just wanted to do something for her, like find her parents...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah nodded and sighed, seeming to believe her, but troubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d love to help you, but I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll be disappointed...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel didn&#39;t ask what she meant, and they set out. As they walked the streets, Eden waved at them across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, ladies!&#34; Eden greeted. &#34;Where are you two headed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel wants to find the late luna&#39;s parents,&#34; Sarah said with an uncomfortable expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes brightened, &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Hamiltion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; Laurel said, &#34;You know them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, not personally. But, you&#39;re in luck.&#34; He grinned, &#34;I know the city quite well from my work and I know where they&#39;re staying. If you&#39;d come with me, I&#39;ll take you to them right now!&#34;</p>
