                <p>Delia sat angrily on the couch in her room, seething at Basil&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Just stay in your room, Delia,* he&#39;d said looking nervous. *I don&#39;t want my father to punish you again.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said that, but was he so dumb not to realize that this was a punishment all by itself? What would Adolph do that was worse than this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shuddered at the thought and turned away from the possibilities. She was Prince Basil&#39;s wife. She should be the most honored woman in the kingdom, yet that girl, Laurel, was managing the castle and was working out of Basil&#39;s mother&#39;s office?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never even seen that office. She&#39;d only been able to use Basil&#39;s ex-wife&#39;s office and room, filled with her old stuff and covered in dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very thought of it made her sick. She&#39;d gotten rid of Laura, yet the woman was still haunting her. She glanced at Tina as she puttered around, grumbling and preparing tea. Of all the people that Laurel had managed to get rid of, Delia was surprised that she hadn&#39;t gotten rid of Tina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprised, grateful, and a bit annoyed. She&#39;d have to put up with the old woman for as long as it took to get into the position to get rid of her. She had been grateful that Tina had been delegated to the kitchen, but Basil took pity on his faithful old nanny and made her Delia&#39;s maid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had pretended to be honored, but she wished Basil would have at least asked her before doing such a thing. She couldn&#39;t stand Tina, and the lazy old woman deserved to be doing hard labor. She&#39;d have to figure out a way to keep Basil from ever doing anything like this again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really can&#39;t figure out why the king likes Laurel so much,&#34; Delia said, knowing Tina would react. &#34;Is that girl the king&#39;s mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tina whirled on her, baring her teeth in fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you saying? How could a country girl be the mate of the great king! How could the moon goddess make such a stupid arrangement!&#34; Tina turned her nose up. &#34;There is only one person the king loves: my late mistress, Luna Olivia!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The declaration irritated Delia. Couldn&#39;t she say anything more useful? She kept her mouth shut. She was still trying to figure out the best way to drive a wedge between Basil and Tina and get her thrown out of the castle. Until then, she still needed Tina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That didn&#39;t stop her from mocking Tina in her mind. Tina was an idiot to think that a dead woman was still holding Adolph&#39;s heart. It didn&#39;t matter how close they&#39;d been when she was alive or even how beautiful she had been. Even if they had a great love, a corpse was nothing compared to a lively young beautiful girl to a werewolf in his prime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just the nature of men!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were such easy creatures. A few sweet words, the appearance of submission, stroke their egos, smile with a pretty face, and tease them a little with a nice figure and any man would be charmed. The king was no exception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil was wrapped her pinkie for a reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph might be swayed by whatever charms Laurel had employed, but there was no denying that he was a different class of man than Basil. Basil was an idiot, easily led and controlled, but Adolph was a man who would not be controlled by even the most charming woman. He was attractive and powerful, but the terror he inspired had likely kept many women away. She didn&#39;t dare meet his gaze, swearing he would know every dirty secret and every secret thought she had if given the chance to gaze into her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fearsome as he was, Adolph was still just a man and Laurel had found a way to obtain his affections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop thinking about that wretched girl,&#34; Tina said primly, pouring tea. &#34;Laurel is not worthy of my mistress&#39;s office, but neither are you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Delia, pursing her lips with a disparaging gaze, &#34;You don&#39;t have even have as much experience as that girl Laura did. For now, you should focus on bearing Prince Basil and heir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned as Delia cast a vicious glare at her. What would she know about running the kingdom? She had only ever been a troublesome head maid who barely did her job and took bribes from her subordinates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura was a dead idiot, and Olivia was just dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my mistress and the king&#34; Tina said with a reverent tone. &#34;If only she were still alive&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia rolled her eyes, tuning out Tina&#39;s musings about Olivia. She didn&#39;t have time to think about the dead. Laurel was the problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most importantly, Laurel&#39;s effect on Basil was the problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil had not spoken his ex-wife&#39;s name since he drove her from the palace. Even after her body was found, he hadn&#39;t seemed to care, yet lately, he&#39;d been mentioning her more and more, comparing Laurel to Laura at almost every chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*She&#39;s just like Laura.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*She pisses me off just like Laura used to! I can&#39;t stand it!*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t bother her at first, but it was happening much more frequently. Even though Basil always acted like he hated Laura and Laurel, his expression had been one of guilt after driving Laurel out of the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned in thought. Basil had been married to Laura for three years before Delia had arrived. Was it possible that Basil still had some feelings for Laura and they were just now starting to surface again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart clenched in fear. It wasn&#39;t possible. He was enthralled with Delia. He would always love her, she was sure of it unless he found out the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia stood and grabbed a cup of tea lifting it to her lips to drink trying to assuage some of her anxiety. He wouldn&#39;t find out that they weren&#39;t mates. How could he? Only she knew how she&#39;d ensnared him and no one would care. She was careful to keep away from Adolph and his piercing gaze. It would be fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She huffed, pulling back as she realized that the teacup was empty and Tina was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed the teapot and poured herself a cup, grumbling to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Useless old woman. Can&#39;t even pour tea for her mistress!&#34; She scoffed. &#34;Just wait until you&#39;re no longer useful, Tina. You&#39;ll see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock sounded on the door and the door opened without any announcement. Delia turned, glaring at the door. Who would have the audacity to just walk into her room?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t permitted you to come in-&#34; she gasped seeing the man standing in the doorway. She cleared her throat, set the teacup on the table, and straightened her clothing nervously. &#34;Eden! What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped inside the door and closed it behind him. She always thought he was handsome, but his grey eyes looked at her with a disdainful indifference. She shivered with delight. He looked at other women differently but he rarely looked at any woman for long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden would always look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have not been improving your reputation in the castle,&#34; Eden said coldly. &#34;Do you think you&#39;re meeting my standards this way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia gasped, &#34;How can that be? You must be mistaken...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; He lifted an eyebrow at her. &#34;I heard the servants saying that Laurel has become the new lady of the castle, taking on the duties of the luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grit her teeth as he continued. His tone wasn&#39;t mocking, but every word made her angry she could barely enjoy being in his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She fired all the useless people and gave them very fair treatment.&#34; Eden tilted his head. &#34;They seem excited to have her as a mistress. Would you like to know what they say of you, Delia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eden, they-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*Lady Delia is just jealous,*&#34; he said, pitching his voice high in an imitation of a maid. &#34;*Whispering bad things in Prince Basil&#39;s ear and making things difficult for Miss Laurel.*&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia grit her teeth, her face burning with embarrassment as anger filled her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*Miss Laurel is a much better luna candidate than Lady Delia.*&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who?&#34; She hissed. &#34;Who said such a thing? I&#39;ll throw her out of the castle-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eden narrowed his eyes, his face expressionless like a mask and Delia drew up short. Her anger vanished as she shivered and lowered her gaze. She knew that Eden didn&#39;t care much about excuses and wouldn&#39;t tolerate it. He expected her to carry out the mission and that was all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she wanted more recognition from him, she would have to accomplish the goal to his standards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want or need you to apologize.&#34; He turned and grabbed the door handle. &#34;Just remember what your mission is and succeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the door and left, closing the door behind him with a soft click.</p>
