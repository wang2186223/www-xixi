                <p>Sam stepped closer and took Laurel by her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Breathe.&#34; He said and watched her take in a deep breath and look up at him fearfully. &#34;You were poisoned and spent a week in a coma. It is not unheard of that your wolf is still recovering from the ordeal. His Majesty couldn&#39;t shift for a few days after being poisoned and you were exposed to a far greater dose than he was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel swallowed and nodded shakily, &#34;O-Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you can shift, we&#39;ll start on that part of your training. For now, we&#39;ll start with basic moves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to regain her calm as Sam lifted his fists and told her to mirror him. He corrected her posture and the grip of her fists kindly and guided her through the basics of how to throw a solid punch. Then, it was a kick. He moved on to a combo, showing her the proper way to hold her balance and how to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt a bit like learning formal dances. She was almost grateful for the strict instruction from the etiquette teacher. Her balance wasn&#39;t perfect due to it being a different kind of movement, but Sam seemed pleased with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked her through a few movements related to using a dagger as well, basic ones for the rest of the hour before releasing her and Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Practice when you can. We&#39;ll pick it up tomorrow,&#34; Sam grinned. &#34;When you&#39;re fully recovered, we&#39;ll train for longer when possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded, grateful for the chance and feeling strangely empowered. It was a new experience every time someone in the castle told her she could learn whatever she wanted without restrictions. Laura had faced so many thick walls she&#39;d had to try and climb over while Laurel was simply knocking on already open doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They went to get lunch and she turned to Sarah with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;ll head into town and check on things today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah&#39;s eyes widened and she smiled at her. Her eyes glimmered with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like company, Miss Laurel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded and looped her arm around Sarah&#39;s, &#34;I would like that very much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah left the castle with her. Sam and Lynn went with them and she let herself remember how much she loved being able to help the people of the kingdom. This was what being the luna was really about. The dangers weren&#39;t a part of the job and if she kept herself focused and supported Adolph, there wouldn&#39;t be any dangers to worry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just had to stay on the path she had chosen to remain at Adolph&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two weeks passed since they had returned from the temple and Laurel started her martial training. She&#39;d surprised herself by how quickly she was picking up the moves and learning to hold herself. Sam was training her to pay closer attention to her senses and use them to keep herself aware of her surroundings. Laurel was surprised at how quickly she was picking up on martial moves. She still hadn&#39;t managed to shift into her wolf form again, but she could feel Alice getting stronger and her body getting through the last stages of recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they ended the session today, Sam faced her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready to try again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and closed her eyes, reaching for Alice tentatively. It felt a bit heady as she reached for her, sinking into a feeling she&#39;d almost forgotten. She felt her body shifting and getting smaller until she opened her eyes and found Sarah and Sam staring at her in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a white wolf?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel yipped with joy, &#34;I did it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sam chuckled at her excitement watching her prance and jump around with glee. He looked at Sarah who had the same relieved and awed look in her eye that he&#39;d had the first time he&#39;d seen Adolph&#39;s wolf form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered how quickly Adolph had shifted, leaping over his head and tearing into a group of vampires as a vicious shadow with glowing red eyes. Before the last body fell, he&#39;d shifted back into his human form, having retained his clothing and his weaponry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Adolph looked at him as he drew his sword, &#34;Injured withdraw. Those who can fight, with me!&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a sight Laurel would make streaking across a battlefield at Adolph&#39;s side like a myth come to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll leave now,&#34; Sam said. &#34;Just in case you didn&#39;t retain your clothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel lay flat and covered her head with her paws, &#34;I think that would be best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll work on it,&#34; Sam said chuckling and nodding at Laurel, &#34;You&#39;ve done great. I&#39;ll wait outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed a kiss to Sarah&#39;s cheek before exiting the room and leaning back against the wall beside the door. His heart felt light as if a prayer he hadn&#39;t known he&#39;d been carrying around had been answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was a prayer that every werewolf had in their hearts since the werewolf kingdom had been established.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel hadn&#39;t retained her clothing through the shift, but Sarah was always prepared with a change of clothes. They walked out of the room and headed with Sam into town to check on the hospital. She had some paperwork to get through in her office, but she wouldn&#39;t be able to get through it without checking in with the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna Laurel!&#34; The hospital&#39;s director cried, her voice grateful as she came near. &#34;Never have I been so grateful to see anyone. How are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Much better.&#34; Laurel smiled, taking the woman&#39;s hands. &#34;Tell me how things have been going? Anything that I should know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a full list as they toured the hospital. They had completed the repairs and the expansion that they had planned, but it looked like they would need to expand further. That meant they needed to purchase or be allowed more land nearby or find another place in the city to establish another hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel figured it would be best to try and allow them to expand the current building rather than trying to make a satellite location, but she took note of both options as they walked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More pressing than the space was the supply needs. They were relying on the local markets at the moment, but if they continued to expand, it would be more cost-effective to negotiate an official contract with merchants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel took note of it before the woman was pulled away to consult about a patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No worries, I&#39;ll be around,&#34; she said, waving the woman on. &#34;I&#39;ll be helping out today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She beamed, &#34;Praise be to the goddess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel turned to check in with the nurse on staff and ask what needed to be done. As usual, they needed help with laundering the bandages and restocking the storeroom. Sarah volunteered to help with the laundry, so Laurel headed towards the supply area and the back door where people were receiving merchants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laurel!&#34; She turned and smiled as Eden approached. &#34;It&#39;s good to see you. I came to the castle to see you but they said you were gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, &#34;Sorry His Majesty took me to the Lunar Temple for a bit of a break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes softened, &#34;I see. Was it helpful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She beamed at him, &#34;I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever felt better. It&#39;s peaceful there. How have you been?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;m working on a trade proposal to secure a spot as an official imperial merchant,&#34; he said, proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fantastic!&#34; Laurel grinned. &#34;I&#39;m glad to hear you&#39;re still pushing forward with your goals. Are you here to drop off deliveries?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, &#34;I assume that means you&#39;re here to help stock the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and followed him to the caravan, lifting a crate and helping to bring it inside. They unloaded the cart, chatting all the while before starting to unpack the boxes and putting the vials and jars on the appropriate shelves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found out that he&#39;d been involved with stocking the hospital and orphanage with goods for the past few weeks as there was a shortage of merchants willing to be under werewolf escort lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s sad, but it means more work for me!&#34; Eden grinned. &#34;I don&#39;t see what the problem is considering the state of things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded and gasped as another nurse dropped a jar. It crashed to the floor, spilling its contents and glass everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, no!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay,&#34; Laurel said, kneeling beside the mess and grabbing a towel. &#34;Just grab some more towels to sop up the mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse scurried off as Laurel began to gather the shards into a pile. She hissed at the sharp prick in her hand and winced at the slow bleeding cut on her finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, at least I&#39;m at the hospital,&#34; she said, jokingly and looked up at Eden who stared at her hand. His eyes glowing with a vicious light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart leaped and her blood went cold as his lips twitched and his eyes filled with hunger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Vampire.*</p>
