                <p>The army traveled at a decent speed towards the Imperial City. As they neared the next city, Laurel realized there was something different about this one, something familiar. The sign declared the next city to be the city of the Golden River Pack, named after the river that seemed to glow gold in the setting sun thanks to the golden silt that formed the river bed. She remembered for her life as Laura that it was one of the kingdom&#39;s most prosperous trading cities as it was the perfect midpoint between the border and the Imperial City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look ahead!&#34; Someone near the front called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People were gathered along the sides of the road and a vaguely familiar man stood in front of them all with a large smile that did not reach his eyes. It reminded Laurel of the nobles of the Imperial City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The closer they grew, the more she recognized him. He was the alpha of the Golden River Pack, Daniel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Daniel greeted them warmly, &#34;Welcome and hail to your victory! A feast is to be held in your honor tonight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered that Alpha Daniel of the Golden River Pack often paid tribute to the nobles of the Imperial City. Fine silks, gems, and spices had been shipped to the palace to ease conversations about making the Golden River Pack a noble pack. They wanted more power to go with their wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had tried to please Laura and engaged in bribery often. She had seen in Alpha Daniel and his people the same tendencies that had made her distance herself from her parents. She had sent back as much of the tribute as she could to avoid any misunderstandings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soldiers whispered between themselves but Adolph&#39;s voice rang out, stern and sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for such care, but we will not be in attendance. We will set up our camp outside of your city as planned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the order made, he ordered the soldiers to start setting up camp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty,&#34; Chasel said, his voice low and cautious as they rode away. &#34;Why are you not going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The presumption that he has the right to make such a plan without informing me and the arrogance to think I would be happy about it irks me. Besides, it is clear he has an ulterior motive for holding this feast and I have no time to entertain it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel was impressed and awed. Adolph had been fighting on the border for years. She was certain he wouldn&#39;t know much about the politics between the various packs in the kingdom. He truly was a sensible man and an involved ruler. Whether he had some feeling before meeting the man or figured it out upon meeting the man, it was impressive that he figured out Alpha Daniel&#39;s character so quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By contrast, Basil had been overly flattered, childish, and impulsive. He&#39;d fought her to keep all of the tribute Alpha Daniel sent and eventually ordered the attendants to ignore her commands regarding the tribute altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They set up their camp outside of the city in near silence. The soldiers seemed down, grumbling a bit about being denied the feast despite all of their hard work when a caravan of people came to the camp. Adolph went to the front of the camp to see them along with the patrol. Alpha Daniel was among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hail the victorious werewolf kingdom,&#34; Alpha Daniel greeted. &#34;Though regrettably, you will not partake in a feast in our city, I have brought this caravan of food and wine as a show of joy and celebration so you may celebrate your victory in what manner is most comfortable for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph wanted to send it back, irked with Daniel&#39;s behavior, but he could not deny that the soldiers had more than earned at least one night of revelry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few moments, Adolph nodded, &#34;Very well. I will permit it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a small cheer of joy as the patrol began to unload the caravan with the help of the attendants. It was dark by the time the caravan was unloaded. Tables were set up in the center of the camp and a bonfire was built by the soldiers and the attendants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The camp was alive and loud with laughter and merriment as they set up the feast. Laurel sat at the edge of the bonfire watching the soldiers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen General Sam?&#34; She frowned and looked at the pair of soldiers conversing nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I haven&#39;t. Have you asked Lynn?&#34; One of them turned. &#34;Lynn! Have you seen General Sam?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another man came around the tent. Laurel remembered him as the soldier who had been delivering a report from the front line to Adolph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lynn seemed startled, &#34;Sam hasn&#39;t been well recently. That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She worried her lip. It wasn&#39;t good to leave an unwell man unattended. Perhaps, she could take a plate to him and check on him or find the new doctor and ask about him. She searched for a while, but she still couldn&#39;t find him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he was treating Sam? She hoped so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving up, she turned back towards the center of the camp where the feast was being set up a bit unhappily. It was probably best for her to just grab a plate and return to her tent if she was going to be in such a mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden runners were spread across the tables and gleaming serving dishes were piled high with meat. The scent of wind danced in the air, warmed by the fire. Beautiful women walked around with serving trays covered in food and drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some were human, some were werewolves, and there was an extraordinarily beautiful vampire slave among them, handcuffed yet graceful as she moved. She was curvy with her head bowed low: the picture of submission. The soldiers seemed to watch her more than the others. While the werewolf and the vampires had been at war, she knew that werewolves gained a lot of pleasure from conquering and ravaging vampire women. She didn&#39;t know if Adolph allowed such things under his watch, but she knew it happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she realized that Daniel was leading the vampire slave and three other women toward Adolph to serve him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel narrowed her eyes. Everyone beyond the camp knew that Adolph was mateless. It was shrewd for Daniel to attempt to ensare Adolph with gifts of beautiful women in the hopes that one of them would be enticing enough for Adolph to take as a marked mate and the future luna. After all, he had only left the regency of the kingdom in Basil&#39;s hands. With the war over, Adolph would take up the duties of the throne in its entirety. He would need a luna to help him shoulder that burden, just as Basil had needed one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniel succeeded, he would be guaranteed a noble title by right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach clenched with nausea and she sneered at Daniel as he passed. She hadn&#39;t liked him before, but she definitely didn&#39;t like him now. Seeing the beautiful women following him across the clearing, she saw Laura in their faces, offered to Basil by her parents for their ends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*He&#39;s ours*, Alice growled. Though she had not yet bonded with Adolph, they were mates. Her hands clenched and trembled with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vampire picked up the jug of wine and kneeled beside Adolph&#39;s chair to pour his drink. Laurel blinked and the woman crumpled beside his chair with a sharp crack. His eyes were burning with fury as the entire camp gasped and realized what happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had he killed her so quickly? Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph turned his furious gaze on Daniel, &#34;Why would you bring such a disgusting *thing* into my camp?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniel stumbled back. The other women drew back behind him, trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I Your Majesty, these women were simply a gift for you. All of this is for your benefit. To celebrate--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean it is for your benefit.&#34; Daniel stammered, but Adolf motioned to one of the soldiers. &#34;Take these women away from me. Dispose of this thing and take a finger from Alpha Daniel for each woman as punishment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel shuddered. There were four women before the vampire had been killed. The women tried to scramble away so quickly it seemed they were running to the soldiers. Despite their fear, the soldiers grabbed them roughly and dragged them away. Daniel cried out in terror, begging forgiveness, but Adolph wasn&#39;t listening. A soldier held his hand still. Daniel screamed and the scent of blood filled the air, different from the undertone of Adolph&#39;s scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shivered as the wind blew and Daniel was taken away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get me another bottle of wine and a goblet,&#34; Adolph ordered, his tone cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soldier hurried to obey and Laurel realized that the charming man who had been so patient with her was just an act for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph, the Vampire Destroyer, the Invincible was as cold and ruthless as the stories said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent of Daniel&#39;s blood lingered throughout the camp, and the soldiers were no longer celebrating. They ate quickly and quietly before getting back to their usual routine. No one looked at Adolph or lingered where he could see them as he sat at the head of the clearing, eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel wondered if wine, food, and beautiful women brought him no pleasure-- what did?</p>
