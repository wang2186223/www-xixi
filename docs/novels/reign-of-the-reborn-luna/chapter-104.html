                <p>Laurel almost laughed. She realized it was a very morbid thing to laugh about, but she couldn&#39;t help it. They walked to the secluded fountain in the garden so he could wash his face and hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They didn&#39;t intend to kill you,&#34; Adolph said, wiping the water from his face. &#34;It seemed that man had orders to kidnap you. For what reason, I don&#39;t know, but I don&#39;t like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one person he could think of who would have a reason to kidnap Laurel for personal reasons, but the vampire queen, if she had enough insider information, would know that Laurel was his weak point and go after her or Basil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the vampire queen was more likely to kill Laurel than try to kidnap her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were only werewolves among the attackers, but that meant almost nothing. It could have been an attack staged by someone who was against his marriage to Laurel, but he doubted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph sighed, &#34;I expected some vampires to be among them, but this tells us that the person behind the attack has an insider source of information or is an insider.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean someone infiltrated the castle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or was involved with the planning. The ministers are spooked by our plans. They&#39;re not above underhanded methods like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel didn&#39;t agree. Underhanded methods and outright treason like this were very different things. She didn&#39;t think that Gavin or any of the other ministers had the audacity or confidence to try and kidnap Laurel at her wedding just yet. They hadn&#39;t pushed them that far yet. In her heart, she felt they would be more likely to try and sabotage a relationship in some other way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How likely is it that one of the ministers is behind this?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not impossible, but it is improbable. Again, I think it&#39;s more likely that they may have inadvertently supplied the information. Still, it gives us more of a reason to get rid of them faster, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel laughed, &#34;Well, I did make a promise to get rid of them as soon as I became luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might as well keep your word. Though&#34; He leered at her with a sly smile. &#34;You won&#39;t technically be luna until we consummate the marriage.  So it&#39;ll have to wait for at least a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A few days?&#34;  Laurel squeaked, her face burning red. &#34;You can&#39;t be serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m as serious as a heart attack.&#34; He offered her his hand. &#34;Come on, we can&#39;t allow the rest of the kingdom to enjoy our wedding reception without us. It&#39;s poor form.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel sighed and took his head nervously, following him back to the ballroom. They slipped back into their shoes and found that Raven and the others had already started the reception to get people&#39;s minds off the attack. He was grateful, sending her a little smile and a nod of acknowledgment before leading Laurel into the hall. Henry approached them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Raven has set up replacement outfits for you to change into for the reception if you&#39;d like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank the goddess for a woman who is always prepared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They parted at the door of the ballroom and slipped into the separate parlors nearby to change. As expected, Raven had another set of robes. Adolph changed quickly and headed back to the ballroom. Laurel stepped out of the other parlor moments later and followed him Inside. They were met with a round of clapping and cheers before he took her hand and led her onto the dance floor to share their first dance as husband and wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to exist in the moment of pure joy with Laurel, but his instincts were screaming at him that there was still danger lurking around every corner. Any one of the people who had been invited could have tipped someone off.  Maybe one of them was directly involved in the attack and waiting for another chance to try again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What would they get out of kidnapping Laurel other than to drive him insane? What game were they playing? Did they know that was an option?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adolf,&#34; Laurel&#39;s voice pulled him from his thoughts, easing his tension. He looked down at her as they whirled around the dance floor. &#34;You&#39;re thinking too hard. Dance with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph pulled her closer and took a deep breath of her scent, letting it calm and center him in the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. You&#39;re right, it&#39;s our wedding day, and I&#39;m worried about someone jumping out from behind the band.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed, &#34;At this point, it&#39;s kind of expected. Although, I think coming down from the chandelier would be a better option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed and glanced up at the chandelier above them, &#34;While it would be quite the surprise, I don&#39;t think that old chandelier would hold anyone&#39;s weight, let alone a battalion of werewolves or vampires.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They could get creative. Killer birds?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed and kissed her as she started to giggle, focusing on the warmth of having her in his arms. They spent the rest of the evening dancing and mingling with the guests who had come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia sat at the edge of the room with a small plate of food and a drink watching them dance. Fury burned in her chest. She had recognized several of the werewolves who had been involved in the attack though they might not have recognized her. She didn&#39;t know who had survived and who hadn&#39;t, but even if some of them were dead, that didn&#39;t mean she was safe. She had changed a great deal from the skinny, pathetic victim she had been. It was unlike Eden to have such a poorly executed attack. Has she missed something? Maybe this wasn&#39;t his attack but one of someone else&#39;s? Maybe Eden&#39;s attack was still coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped it was, and that Laurel accidentally ended up dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The new luna is so different from the old one. I don&#39;t know what to make of it.&#34; A noble said from nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The prince&#39;s late wife or the king&#39;s late wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I had forgotten about her. She bears quite a resemblance to her. What was her name? Laura, I think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder how Prince Basil feels about it. Maybe father and son share a type.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They laughed, and Delia grit her teeth. Didn&#39;t they know she was right here? How could they talk about the position that should be hers like she wasn&#39;t there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still, there&#39;s not much you can say about her. It&#39;s not like Laura who we all knew wasn&#39;t the prince&#39;s mate. The king had their ceremony at the temple. No one can question that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder what will happen to Prince Basil when they have kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia&#39;s heart lurched and she listened closely. She had never considered that. She never even thought it was a problem since Basil was the oldest, but she knew almost nothing about how the Raymond family operated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, the prince is the oldest, but their child would be blessed by the temple because they married on temple grounds. I think that kind of makes them even in the eyes of the people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I spoke with the minister of peace a while back about the implications of having Laurel on the throne if they got married at the temple. He said that whatever kid she has by the king would be considered the crowned heir due to some old covenant the family has with the temple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yikes, do you think Prince Basil knows that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How does that affect him and his wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, but I don&#39;t think we have to worry about that. I heard they aren&#39;t really getting along anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delia took a deep, steadying breath and clenched her fist in her dress.  How had they heard anything about her and Basil&#39;s relationship? Were the servants talking? Did the nobles still have spies in the castle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just look at him,&#34; one of them said. &#34;He looks miserable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;d be miserable too if my wife was the reason why my spending budget got cut.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They laughed and Delia&#39;s face burned with embarrassment. It seemed that the servant didn&#39;t have to talk since the ministers talked so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to make this right.  She had to get Laurel out of her position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how? She worried her lip and looked across the room as Adolph and Laurel whirled around the dance floor and felt sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Just you wait* she thought. *I&#39;ll get rid of you the same way I got rid of her somehow.*</p>
