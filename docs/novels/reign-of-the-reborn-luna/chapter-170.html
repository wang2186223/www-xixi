                <p>Laurel didn&#39;t expect Basil to come quickly, so when the door closed, she was grateful that Nimue made herself a cup of tea and smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were once someone else,&#34; Nimue said. &#34;I am glad that the moon saw fit to bring the white wolf back to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel blinked and sat across from her, &#34;You&#39;re not much like Eden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nimue chuckled, &#34;Eden and I have different gifts He is what we would call an elemental Wiccan. Lightning strikes, fire, flashy shows of power that most associate with real magic. I&#39;m a spiritual mage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel blinked and made herself a cup of tea, &#34;What does that mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It means I have a connection to the living and the dead. Hence, I know the body you&#39;re in right now is one you were reborn into. I can only guess how you died, but I assume that Basil knew you in your past life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel winced, &#34;This isn&#39;t how I expected this conversation to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nimue shrugged, &#34;You make plans and the spirits laugh, but I&#39;m not concerned about your aura. It&#39;s more than healthy and that boy you&#39;re carrying is going to be a force to be reckoned with.&#34;</p>

                <p>Nimue grinned, &#34;Unborn children are on the threshold. I like to check on them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel smiled, stroking her stomach, &#34;Well thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nimue nodded, &#34;About your husband&#39;s curse&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel winced, &#34;You&#39;re rather forward, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you rather us pretend to small talk when the worry is eating you alive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel shook her head, &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think the curse can be lifted, but there is a choice that has to be made and only Basil and your husband can make it.&#34; She shook her head, &#34;Usually, I wouldn&#39;t let two men have the final say, but it is a matter of their bloodline. Your husband may be capable of making fantastic decisions, but Basil will need some coercing He&#39;s terrified.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel nodded, &#34;Terrified of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me. His future. Disappointing his father Not having a large enough cock and anything else a young man of his age, station, and background would worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel burst into laughter as the door opened and Basil walked in. His clothes were back in place and he closed the door quietly behind him before taking a seat in one of the chairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nimue almost rolled her eyes, &#34;She saw me, hardly the time to be timid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil cleared his throat, &#34;As I said, it&#39;s complicated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nimue chuckled, &#34;Sure. We were about to speak about your father and the choices you two have to make.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Choices?&#34; Basil asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mother laid this curse, using her life as the spark and your life as the kindling to keep it going. The most peaceful way to break it would be to summon her and have her forgive him for whatever wrong has transpired between them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Summon her?&#34; Basil choked, &#34;Like bring her here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she die in this castle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Basil said tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, &#34;Then, yes. At least on the castle grounds the temple would probably be the best space.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can do that?&#34; Laurel asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nimue nodded, &#34;Seances are fairly easy. She&#39;s somewhat bound here until the curse is complete anyway, so it will be even easier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil winced, fiddling with his teacup. When he was a child, all he&#39;d wanted was to meet his mother, but so many things had transpired. Would she understand his stance about Gavin&#39;s betrayal? Was she also aware of the plot and a part of it? What about this situation with Nimue?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wolf was adamant that they were mates. He wasn&#39;t sure what actual power she could wield against him, but he had felt unable to resist her when she&#39;d started to undress him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a long time since he&#39;d had sex, but he didn&#39;t remember being that helpless to the slightest touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*We&#39;re mates and you&#39;re dumb.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He huffed at his wolf&#39;s commentary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could use Basil as a conduit to give her a bit more corporeality,&#34; Nimue said, &#34;Though, in some ways, he is already a conduit due to the way she formulated the curse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basil,&#34; Laurel cut in. Basil lifted his head. &#34;Your father will only get worse if we do nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil flinched and he clenched his hands as the door opened and Adolph entered. Basil looked at him, taking in his stature and imagining the worse. Would it kill him? Simply rot him from the inside until he didn&#39;t recognize him or anything or would it strike like lightning one day?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either way, Basil couldn&#39;t live with thinking he&#39;d done nothing and he couldn&#39;t go on worrying about it without knowing for certain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;what do I have to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph was at a loss for words as they walked to the temple. He felt on edge. This wasn&#39;t how things were meant to go, but Laurel had been adamant that they get this over with before the baby arrived for the sake of their future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The baby was due in just a few days. Laurel could go into labor at any time and that thought alone was driving him crazy, but he held his peace and followed Laurel&#39;s wishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wished he&#39;d said no now that he knew that it would involve another ritual, using Basil as a conduit, talking to Olivia, and who knew what else. His sister met them in front of the steps, dressed in full temple garb and looking a bit worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve made sure everything was ready,&#34; she said. &#34;Just be careful. We&#39;ll be on standby in case the luna goes into labor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph nodded and looked back at Basil who stared ahead with a brave expression. Adolph chuckled and clapped him on his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You worry too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basil&#39;s eyes glimmered and he looked away without speaking. They entered and Nimue surveyed the space before nodding. She pulled her staff from her back and stood at the altar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna Laurel, stand back from the altar.&#34; He gestured to a corner behind the altar. &#34;Basil, Your Majesty, stand on either side of the altar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adolph stood on one side and looked across it at his son who seemed to be trembling with anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel stood off to the side behind Adolph, clasping her hands together and hoping against hope that this would go smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind began to stir around them and she watched the spaces between the columns turn white as if sheets had been draped over them. The wind picked up and sparked as it swirled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Child of the moon, now gone from this world. Spirit once called Olivia Mirabelle, I call you,&#34; Nimue said, her voice turning to a loud whisper in the air. &#34;Come to this altar by request of your once husband whom you have cursed. He who seeks forgiveness. Come to this altar by request of your living son whom you have yoked with this curse. He who seeks his father&#39;s freedom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air shivered and the white began to flicker with darkness. Nothing appeared, but the wind did not die down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nimue&#39;s eyes narrowed and she tapped her staff on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I summon you, Olivia Mirabelle, to stand in judgment as curse-layer and corrupted of the line of the moon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A screech filled the air. A figure cried out and collapsed in the center of the room. Her blonde hair was spilled in long curls across the floor. She was dressed in a fine ornate gown. Slowly, she picked herself up and lifted her eyes, glaring at Nimue. Laurel gasped. Adolph was frozen in place as Olivia stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t as beautiful as Laurel had expected her to be. Her blonde hair looked a bit dull and was near translucent. Her eyes were a deep brown that seemed a bit unnatural. There was something in her eyes or the curve of her lips that made Laurel uncomfortable. She wondered if her portrait looked like this. She resembled Gavin, but Laurel bet she took after her mother more than anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was because this was her spirit rather than the actual woman that Laurel was uncomfortable with the sight of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia turned her eyes on Adolph and smiled a bit dreamily before walking to the altar, completing the circle of people around the altar. She looked as though she wanted to be closer to him, inching around the large round altar table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Nimue and I am serving as medium and arbitrator of this meeting and judgment,&#34; Nimue said. &#34;You will only speak the truth when questioned and abide by the rules of this plane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of light went over Olivia, giving more life to the color of her hair and her clothes, but she still didn&#39;t look right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother?&#34; Basil gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia didn&#39;t turn to look at him, looking up at Adolph who seemed too still. Laurel swallowed, almost regretting being so adamant about doing this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a long time, my love.&#34;</p>
