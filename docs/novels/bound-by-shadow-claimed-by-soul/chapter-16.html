                <p>&#34;I think we should go,&#34; Jacque declared for the hundredth time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jacque, we have noted what you think, you need not keep telling us.&#34; Vasile&#39;s words were slightly sarcastic, but softened by the twinkle in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noted isn&#39;t good enough, Alpha. Why are we just sitting here when we could be trekking through the forest to be with the others? Power in numbers, remember?&#34; Jacque paced the meeting room while the others continued to look through the books they had brought with them from the archives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will contact Peri and confer with her about it. How&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque glared at Vasile. &#34;Better&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Vasile got off the phone with Peri, he assembled the others in the meeting room. Everyone took the spots they had unofficially deemed as their own around the constantly burning fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Peri said that Jen is still too weak to travel, and Decebel as well. She agrees with you, Jacque, that we should all be together,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woot! I told ya, didn&#39;t I tell ya?&#34; Jacque grinned wickedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fane nudged her, attempting to hint that she needed to zip it. Jacque reluctantly quieted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As I was saying, she thinks we should be together. However, it is not safe for us to travel in the forest without protection. She is going to send one of her own to come so they can veil our presence. The witch is constantly seeking for us, for any way to strike out against us. So, we will wait until herperson arrives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long will that take?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are humans so impatient?&#34; They all turned toward the door to see a short female with long pink hair that was braided down her back. She had an unusual face with almond shaped eyes that were an unusual silver color, a small, but cute button nose, and a pouty mouth that looked like it remained in a permanent smile. She wore brown leather pants and a green, snug, thermal looking shirt. Over the shirt she wore a vest-like top that held variously sized knives and from what they could see poking over the back, two swords. Her boots laced wickedly around her calves to just below her knees. Jacque decided that regardless of her name, she was going to call her Surely, because she could surely kick anyone&#39;s ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are the one Peri sent?&#34; Vasile asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Alpha. My name is Elle, I&#39;m here to take you to the Veil. We must move quickly, there is evil on the wind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When everyone stood and began to head for the stairs to gather their things, Elle stopped them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All you need is a heavy coat. Everything else will be provided for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crina and Jacque looked at each other, then both shrugged their shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you say so, Surely,&#34; Jacque mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crina looked at her, eyes narrowed. &#34;Should I ask why you called her Shirley?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque laughed and explained it to Crina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crina shook her head, chuckling. &#34;You never cease to entertain me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were on their way, moving quickly through the snow-laden forest, Fane followed Jacque up to the front of the group. Elle was leading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re a fairy?&#34; Jacque asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elle smiled at her and Jacque couldn&#39;t stop the responsive smile. Elle was one of those contagiously happy people. Jacque liked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am a fairy,&#34; Elle confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can do all sorts of cool stuff, can&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna, what are you doing?&#34; Fane&#39;s voice filled Jacque&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chillax, wolf-man, I just want to ask a few questions. I mean, heeeello, it&#39;s not every day that I get to meet a fairy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fane smiled at his mate&#39;s curiosity, but also worried that she might offend Elle. A ticked-off fairy is not one you wanted to deal with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suppose I can do stuff that&#39;s cooler than what humans can,&#34; Elle said thoughtfully. &#34;But I can&#39;t do any magic out here right now, it would be too easy for the witch to find us, even through the veiling spell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque nodded her understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group was quiet as they walked. An eerie silence filled the forest - no animals scurrying about, no birds flew overhead. It was as if the entire forest held its breath, trying to hide in plain sight, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quiet did not go unnoticed by Elle as she led the Alpha and his wolves through the trees. Peri had made it very clear that they were to move quickly, take very few breaks, and make any stops short. Elle could feel the black magic slithering across the shield that she had cast over them and shuddered at the knowledge of who wielded that magic. She glanced back, quickly meeting Vasile&#39;s eyes, giving a brief nod that he understood: pick up the pace. And when Elle began moving more quickly, everyone else followed suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mona stood out on the ledge of the mountain her home was situated on. She knew someone, or many someone&#39;s, were moving through the forest. However, she couldn&#39;t get a lock on them. Using her will to move through the air, she continued to search for whoever they were. Still nothing. In frustration, she opened her eyes and glared at the vast forest before her. She decided it was time to scry. It wasn&#39;t something she usually liked because it could be somewhat tricky to decipher what the meaning of what she would see could be. It didn&#39;t always mean something obvious. But, desperate times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mona entered her home and turned left, entering a room full of cages, all holding different animals. She opened one of the bottom cages and reached in, grabbing a rabbit by the scruff. Without a thought she twisted the rabbit&#39;s neck with a sickening crunch. She took the now-dead animal to her table and slit its throat, allowing its blood to flow into a shallow, large basin. Once the blood was drained, she tossed the small body into a basket underneath the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up her scrying stones and held them in her hands to warm them. Then she chanted:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stones of mystery, stones of fate,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peer through the Veil to this date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a life to give you blood,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pour out the truth like a flood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over and over she chanted this as she threw the stones into the blood-filled basin. As the last hit the still-warm fluid, she opened her eyes to see the outcome. Her eyes narrowed and a sinister smile crossed her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, isn&#39;t that interesting?&#34; An evil laugh shook free from her chest. &#34;I do love it when things get interesting,&#34; she muttered to herself.</p>
