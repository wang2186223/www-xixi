                <p>Jen laid on the bed, tears slowly leaking from her eyes. She felt the wetness trail down the side of her face, across her ears, and onto the pillow. She couldn&#39;t explain why she was crying. She was Jennifer-freaking-Adams, she didn&#39;t cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah, well think again, She-Rah. Apparently, you do, she thought. She was hurting. Her body was sore and aching, but she had always been able to handle physical pain. These tears were caused by something un-named, undefined.  She thought back to Rachel&#39;s and Gavril&#39;s words about the consequences of the bond being broken between her and Decebel. They&#39;d explained that they had gone and talked to this Perizada character and had agreed that, at this point, it was best if Decebel and the others didn&#39;t know the things Jen already did. Jen&#39;s response naturally was why the hell not? Rachel wasn&#39;t used to such crassness and kept giving Jen looks that said she thought she needed her mouth washed out with soap. Rachel had told her that Perizada, who was a powerful Fae, said that it had to happen this way, the fates deemed it necessary for Sally and the others to come see her first - something about not wanting Sally to know about healers and werewolves just yet. Jen still felt like Rachel and Gavril were batting for the home team, but that didn&#39;t mean she wasn&#39;t upset about them interfering with her and Decebel, especially when her mate didn&#39;t even remember her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night had fallen and the house was quiet. Jen closed her eyes and listened to the sounds of the night, calming her mind. She could hear the howl of the wind outside, the occasional hoot of an owl, and even once the howl of a wolf, which brought goose bumps to her skin. She clenched her jaw as another round of pain ran through her and her mind reached out for something, something that wasn&#39;t there any longer. She felt something in her stir, something in her growl. Jen clamped her mouth shut, refusing to let loose the snarl that threatened to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will not lose it,&#34; she said into the darkness. &#34;I&#39;m in pain, yes; I&#39;m scared, yes. I want to see my friends and my mate. YES! But I will not lose it. So put on your big girl panties, Jennifer, and pull it together!&#34; Jen was grinding her teeth by the end of her little pep talk. She let out a deep breath and closed her eyes. She&#39;d won the battle - tonight.  But the war wasn&#39;t over and she had a feeling this was just a skirmish compared to what was coming. Her eyes closed and darkness poured over her. She tried to open her eyelids, but they were heavy. She felt herself being pulled under, her last thoughts about battles, wars, and love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she awake yet?&#34; A gruff voice rumbled as Jen began to wake from the deep sleep she had finally drifted off into late last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a week since we saw Peri.&#34; It was Rachel speaking now. &#34;And every day she looks weaker, paler. I&#39;m doing everything I can for her injuries, Gav. It&#39;s not working. She isn&#39;t getting better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavril walked over to the girl who lay in their kitchen. Her face was pale even as it glistened with sweat. He pressed his hand to her forehead and watched her eyes squeeze in pain. Did his touch hurt her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s responding to touch,&#34; he told Rachel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel stood next to her mate and watched as Jen&#39;s face grimaced. Suddenly Jen rolled over, a loud groan escaping her throat. She flung her head over the side of the bed, vomiting violently. Rachel rushed forward and pulled Jen&#39;s hair out of the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gavril! Get some cool wet towels, please.&#34; Rachel&#39;s tone was firm and in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen felt Rachel rub her back gently, murmuring in some language that she was pretty sure wasn&#39;t Romanian.  The heaving finally stopped and she was able to catch her breath, but that was too good to last. Just as Rachel started to help her back up the nausea rushed through her again. Jen doubled over as something metallic filled her mouth. Her eyes widened as she watched bright red liquid hit the floor. Blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel&#39;s gut tightened as she watched the blood pour from Jen&#39;s mouth. She closed her eyes and laid her hands on Jen&#39;s stomach while Gavril held Jen&#39;s hair back and held her steady. Rachel reached into Jen&#39;s body, seeking out the source of the sickness. She could feel the pain that flowed through her very veins. She reached into Jen&#39;s mind and gasped as she felt what Jen did. Her veins felt like they were on fire, like the very blood that flowed through them boiled. She tried to find what it was that was causing it. Infection from her injuries, some sort of bacteria somewhere, but she found nothing. Blackness was reaching into Jen&#39;s mind, a dark void cloaking her, and nothing Rachel did could cause it to recede.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel pulled her hands back and opened her eyes. She looked up at Gavril, tears rolling down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rachel, Luna, what&#39;s wrong?&#34; Gavril&#39;s voice was gentle as he watched his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel shook her head. &#34;She&#39;s dying and it&#39;s my fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen finally stopped vomiting and Rachel took the moist towels Gavril had brought her and wiped her mouth and face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean she&#39;s dying?&#34; he asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel looked deep into her mate&#39;s eyes. &#34;You know how the darkness was beginning to consume you before you met me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The darkness begins to consume all males without their true mate,&#34; he answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I broke their bond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does that have to do with it?&#34; Gavril stepped around Jen&#39;s bed. He put his fingers on his mate&#39;s chin and gently raised her head so he could see her azure eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is darkness in her, consuming her. The kind of darkness I found in unmated males anytime I had to heal them. It&#39;s killing her. There&#39;s no balance in her without him and somehow when I severed the bond, it&#39;s like the darkness in him, the darkness she would keep at bay, somehow seeped into her. I don&#39;t know how to describe it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It sounds like dark magic.&#34; Gavril stroked her face gently watching as his mate&#39;s heart broke over the dormant. &#34;You were only protecting us,&#34; he whispered gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel&#39;s head snapped back as if he had slapped her. &#34;It&#39;s my job to protect her, to protect others! I&#39;m a HEALER!&#34; Rachel was shaking - so angry with herself, with the Fae, with everything. As a healer, it broke her heart to think she had hurt another. If Jen was going through this, what was her mate enduring?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Peri said that her mate had been cursed by the witch. Maybe that is why the bond being severed has caused this reaction in her. It may not have anything to do with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Regardless, you and I both know we should have risked whatever we needed to get her back to her mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavril lowered his eyes, something an Alpha rarely did. Rachel reached up and touched his cheek. He pulled her into his arms. &#34;If I was her mate, I would kill me.&#34; His voice was soft and deep. &#34;You&#39;re right, love. If someone kept you from me, if someone took our bond, I wouldn&#39;t be able to stand it.&#34; He stepped back and raised her chin once again. &#34;We will fix this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel nodded once and looked down at Jen. Her eyes were closed and her breathing was labored. She propped a pillow under her to raise her chest up. She took a seat next to the bed and held Jen&#39;s hand. &#34;We have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel fell to his knees as he doubled over in pain. He felt nausea rolling through him, but nothing came up. His head hung and sweat dripped from his brow despite the cold air. Sally, Cynthia, and Costin surrounded him but didn&#39;t touch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the sixth time today,&#34; Cynthia spoke quietly to Sally. &#34;It&#39;s been a week since we started off. He gets worse every day. Pretty soon he isn&#39;t going to be able to walk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally took a deep breath and pushed it out through her teeth. Frustration threatened to overwhelm her as she watched the powerful wolf fight an invisible enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally growled in frustration. &#34;ARGH! We&#39;ve been wandering all over this cold freaking mountain for a week! Where is this fairy? What are we supposed to do, drag a half-dead, huge werewolf through the mountains shouting, &#39;Here fairy, fairy. Come help the poor whittle healer.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin walked over to Sally. She looked up at him and snarled. Costin lifted a lip in return and tapped her on the nose. &#34;Calm yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally&#39;s jaw nearly hit the ground at his audacity. Did he just tap me on the nose? Calm myself? What the-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm myself?&#34; Sally&#39;s voice was low as she looked up at the handsome wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re frustrated, I get that. I know you&#39;re scared, I get that too.&#34; Costin stepped closer to her and laid his warm hand against her cold face. &#34;But you don&#39;t get to lose it right now. You don&#39;t have that luxury, okay? You will pull yourself together and we will get Decebel through this. We will find Peri.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally tried really hard not to close her eyes and lean her face into his large warm hand, honestly, she did. When she opened her eyes Costin&#39;s eyes were glowing. Crap, she thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a step back and nodded once. &#34;Pull it together. Got it. I&#39;m good now, I just needed to have a freak out moment. I&#39;ve had it, I&#39;m good to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin smiled that breath-taking smile. &#34;Excellent.&#34; Then he stepped over to Decebel and knelt down. &#34;How are you doing, Beta?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low growl emitted from Decebel. &#34;Something is very wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you walk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded once and struggled to his feet. Cynthia stood on his left, ready to help if necessary. Finally, he stood, and Costin and Cynthia backed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel&#39;s glowing eyes met Sally&#39;s. &#34;We really need to find that fairy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally nodded. &#34;I know, Decebel. And aside from screaming at the top of my lungs I don&#39;t know what else to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We just keep walking,&#34; Cynthia said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin nodded his agreement. He looked at Decebel. &#34;Let&#39;s keep going until it gets dark. Can you handle that?&#34; Costin knew the challenge would spur the Beta on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin chuckled. &#34;Good. Let&#39;s go, then.&#34; He turned to Sally. &#34;You coming, healer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally stuck her tongue out at Costin as he waited for her to pass him. He simply chuckled at her, making her want to stomp on his foot - childishmaybe.  And although she really wanted to slap him for his earlier Alpha-wolf show, she had needed someone to snap her out of it. If it had been Jen, Jen would have slapped her and told her to pull it together. So maybe having a hot wolf like Costin tell her that instead wasn&#39;t as bad as she thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The four continued on a non-existent path, Cynthia leading, Decebel, Sally, and Costin bringing up the rear. So, it had been for the past week.  As they walked and the day dragged on, Sally began to feel like they were being watched. She paused as they topped another long hill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it just me or does it feel like the trees have eyes?&#34; she asked wearily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;ve been feeling like we are being watched as well.&#34; Decebel&#39;s voice was raspy with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin took a protective step in front of Sally as they each peered into the darkening forest. The sun began to set and the temperature continued to drop. Finally, after standing there for several moments feeling like they were in a standoff, Sally yelled, &#34;Show yourself!  We know you&#39;re there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They each let out a breath they didn&#39;t realize they had been holding. Then a voice came from up ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to be one of the bravest, mouthiest healers I have met in some time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel stepped forward, placing himself in front of their group. Costin stepped up beside him, blocking both Sally and Cynthia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally rolled her eyes, looking at Cynthia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cynthia smiled. &#34;Alpha males,&#34; she murmured, and winked as if that were explanation enough - which it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they all looked straight ahead in the direction the voice had originated from, they saw a soft glow emerge from the trees. There was a flash of light, which caused them all to turn their heads and cover their eyes. Then, just like that, it was gone. In its place stood a beautiful woman. She looked to be in her mid-twenties, but the weary look in her eyes said she was much older and had seen more than her share of heartache. She was tall and slender, with waist-length white hair that shimmered with her movements, as if little lights were attached along each strand. Her lips were ruby red and her high cheeks had a natural blush to them. Sally noticed that she did indeed have pointed ears, although not so prominent as to stand out. Her most striking feature were her eyes. They were a pale peridot green with a very soft glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Perizada.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will admit that the bright light is a little ostentatious and not necessary, but I figured it&#39;s your first time to meet a Fae, might as well go all out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody said anything as they stared at the eerily beautiful Fae.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perizada?&#34; Sally wanted to confirm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only.&#34; The fairy smiled sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excellent,&#34; Sally murmured with a wicked smile as she started toward the woman. &#34;So bloody nice of you to finally grace us with your presence,&#34; she growled as she continued forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin grabbed her around the waist, pulling her back against his chest. &#34;Easy,&#34; he whispered in her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;While you have been taking your sweet damn time revealing yourself to us, our friends are in trouble.  Decebel is on the verge of keeling over and who knows what&#39;s happening to Jen! So please do tell. What has been so freaking important that you have taken a week, A BLOODY WEEK, TO CONTACT US!&#34; Sally was panting and continuing to pull against Costin&#39;s hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perizada stepped closer, her eyes running over each of them, then back to Sally. &#34;Are you sure you&#39;re a healer? You&#39;re awfully temperamental.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AHHH!&#34; Sally screamed against Costin&#39;s hold. &#34;You haven&#39;t seen temperamental until you&#39;ve seen Jen. I&#39;m a peach compared to her. Where the hell have you been! Why did you take so long? Don&#39;t you get it? Decebel is -&#34; Sally stuttered and pointed at the weakened Beta, &#34;and Jen is, is, well -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jen is dying,&#34; the Fae said matter-of-factly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally gasped and would have collapsed had Costin not been holding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel&#39;s knees buckled as he howled a sound so painful that Sally thought her heart would tear from her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know that! You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about!&#34; Sally couldn&#39;t believe the way she was acting, but it just all hit at once. She was cold, tired, and scared. And now this Perizada stood there, speaking so casually about the demise of her best friend. It was just too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SILENCE!&#34; Perizada yelled and the air around her seemed to shimmer and crackle. &#34;You know nothing about which you speak, healer. I am Perizada, ambassador to the supernatural world from Farie. I was here before you were even a thought in your mother&#39;s mind and I will be here when your bones are dust buried layers beneath the earth. You do not have the privilege of questioning me.&#34; Perizada&#39;s eyes were glowing and her hair whipped behind her by an unnatural breeze. &#34;I will answer you not because I have to, but because I respect you as the current healer to the wolves. I have been leading a very nasty witch on a fruitless chase. She was getting close to discovering Rachel and Gavril&#39;s location and that cannot happen, must not happen. I could not risk coming to you until I had sufficiently squelched her plan. That is where I have been. You must not be so narrow-minded to believe your friends are the only lives worthy of rescue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch it, Fae,&#34; Decebel growled, managing to sound menacing even from his broken position on the cold, snow-covered ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I meant no offense, wolf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to take us to Jen now?&#34; Sally asked, her anger now being replaced by fear and worry for her friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I will have to have Gavril bring her to us. I cannot have you and Rachel in the same place. Your combined magic would draw the witch like a moth to a flame.&#34; Peri turned to Decebel. She walked over and leaned down in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I owe you an apology Beta. I did not realize the bond between you and Jennifer was so strong. It has been long since I have interacted with the wolves and I had forgotten the fragility of a new bond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t remember her. How can our bond be strong if a witch&#39;s spell was able to erase my mate from my mind?&#34; Decebel&#39;s voice was tight with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have not shared blood. Listen, she has not been erased. Your wolf knows her or else you would not feel the pain you are feeling. Your fates are intertwined even without completing the Blood Rites. I haven&#39;t seen a bond like this in a long time.&#34; Peri laid her hand on Decebel, offering the little comfort through touch that she could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come.&#34; She stood, motioning for them to follow. &#34;We have a long journey to Farie, we mustn&#39;t tarry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you say Farie?&#34; Cynthia sputtered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where else can I keep your presence safe from others?&#34; the Fae asked in a condescending tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, of course. Where else?&#34; Sally muttered sarcastically as Costin finally relinquished his hold on her. She glared at him as they began to walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you hold me back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you needed to be protected from yourself in that moment. I told you, it&#39;s my job to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even from myself?&#34; Sally rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Especially from yourself.&#34; Costin winked and grinned, completely non-plussed by her snarkiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, well, who will protect me from you?&#34; Sally muttered under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin heard Sally&#39;s muttered question and the pain in her voice as she stomped past him to follow Peri. His brow drew together as he thought about her words. The only explanation he could come up with for such a comment was that she was developing feelings for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It worried him that he felt so strongly for her even though she wasn&#39;t Canis lupus. He shook his head at the thought. It didn&#39;t matter. Sally was his, and she would just have to accept that. If he were being honest with himself, he would admit that he enjoyed the thought of making her come to terms with their inevitable relationship. But then again, where was the fun in being honest with oneself?</p>
