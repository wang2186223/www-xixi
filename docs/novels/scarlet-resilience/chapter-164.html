                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t find her,&#34; Sandra says as she walks into my English classroom. &#34;I don&#39;t know how you thought I was going to when she doesn&#39;t have her phone,&#34; she says, looking at her phone. &#34;What made her leave?&#34; she asks. I look at her, and I feel ashamed to tell her. &#34;What did you do?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; I say and look at her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know most of the rumours are lies, right?&#34; she asks. I look back at her. &#34;I spend a lot of time with her, and she tells me most everything,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this where you tell me she&#39;s not sleeping with every male in her year?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t going to, but if that is what you think, then I am going to tell you that yes. She&#39;s slept with four people,&#34; she says, and I frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not what I&#39;ve heard,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course that&#39;s not what you&#39;ve heard because you&#39;ve been sleeping with every woman you come across and if you think that of her then it makes you feel less guilty,&#34; she snaps at me. &#34;I&#39;ve never known such stupid people,&#34; she says and folds her arms. &#34;I&#39;m going to tell David to beat you up next time you&#39;re training together,&#34; she huffs, and I smile. &#34;She knows you know,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Knows what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That you&#39;re quickly making your way through all the females in California,&#34; she states. &#34;And you&#39;re leaving. She&#39;s going to be distraught when she finds that out,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She knew I was leaving,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She knew you were leaving in August not June,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I highly doubt she&#39;s bothered by it, she&#39;s made her feelings perfectly clear, and I&#39;m done talking about this,&#34; I say and look at her phone as she gets a text. I open it and see it&#39;s from Tyler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Fancy a quickie b4 Art?&#39; he texts and I sigh. Why did I open this text? I scroll up the text messages to see she refuses him more often than she says yes to him. Whenever she does, he seems to get angry and accuses her of sleeping with one of his friends. I sigh and send &#39;No&#39; to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look up at Sandra, and she glares at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me the phone,&#34; she holds her hand out to me. I shake my head, &#34;She&#39;ll be angry with you if you go through it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s already pissed at me, if I keep her phone she&#39;ll have to come and talk to me,&#34; I say and her phone pings. I look back at her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Is it b/cos u screwed Kenneth?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenneth,&#34; I say shocked, and I look at Sandra. &#34;That giant,&#34; and Sandra laughs. Kenneth is the tallest guy in the school, and he&#39;s built like a brick shithouse. If the team didn&#39;t get tested regularly for steroids, I&#39;d think he was on them. I frown to myself and then look down at her phone. &#34;She wouldn&#39;t have,&#34; I say quietly and then look at Sandra to see her smile. &#34;Would she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His biceps are bigger than my head,&#34; I say, and her smile widens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, is Kenneth, the basketball team captain?&#34; she asks, and I nod. &#34;Wow, he is a large man,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it,&#34; I say, glaring at her. &#34;I know what you&#39;re doing, and I&#39;m not falling for it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder if it&#39;s all in proportion, you know the height and everything,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not listening,&#34; I say, putting her phone back in her bag. &#34;It&#39;s what you do with it,&#34; I mutter and she laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\--</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl looks at me as I idly press piano keys. He sighs and sits next to me to start playing. He hates it when I&#39;m depressed, and that is what I am right now. The talk I had with Sandra upset me. I feel like an arsehole, Sandra claims we&#39;re both being stupid, but Megan was the one to end things with me. She was the one that made me think she&#39;d happily moved on to Tyler and Brendon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time we&#39;re together, she confuses the hell out of me, and I can&#39;t do it anymore. Leaving is the best option; I kind of wish I could leave earlier. I don&#39;t want to leave but watching her run around, making the choices she&#39;s making, I can&#39;t wait for her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you hear?&#34; he asks. I nod and look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got a text,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I also heard she slept with Kenneth,&#34; I look at him and glare at him. He smirks and starts to play a &#39;Bruno Mars&#39; song. &#34;Probably not true though,&#34; he says</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it matter?&#34; I ask and get up. &#34;I shouldn&#39;t care who she is with,&#34; I say and pick up my half-eaten apple off of the Piano.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She comes in here quite often, plays some depressing song and then leaves,&#34; he pauses. &#34;You&#39;re both starting to bum me out,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told her I&#39;m leaving in July,&#34; I say. He stops playing and looks at me. &#34;She started crying,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t that tell you she feels something for you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It tells me she&#39;s sad about it, but that&#39;s it, could be crying because I&#39;m not taking her, no free flight to England,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up before I shut you up,&#34; he snaps, and I frown at him. He has never threatened me. &#34;You&#39;re talking nonsense; she cried because she feels something for you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well if that&#39;s true why is she doing this to me?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, but once you know you&#39;ll feel like a complete dick,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already do,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sandra told me she&#39;s not slept with as many people as I&#39;m led to believe, 4 to be exact,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;4?&#34; he asks and frowns. &#34;Wow, then that means people are lying,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yep, and I&#39;m a dick, I&#39;ve been thinking with my dick for the past few weeks because I thought she was, I should have known she&#39;s not like that,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no point in beating yourself up about it, it&#39;s not like she&#39;s ever denied any of the rumours,&#34; he states and then the door opens. Yasmin walks in, she looks at Carl and then at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, hi,&#34; she says to me. I give her a small smile and look at Carl to see him glaring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want Miss Murphy,&#34; he snaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm...I wanted to talk to you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About what,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#34; she looks at me, and it&#39;s like she&#39;s asking me for help. I&#39;m not sure what I can do for her from what Carl has told me, she&#39;s been giving him the cold shoulder, even skipped his class. &#34;I&#39;d like to start coming back to class,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no room, in my class anymore, the student office has taken you off my register,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I need the credits,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should have thought about that before skipping my class so much,&#34; he says coldly. &#34;You&#39;ll have to make the credits another way,&#34; he says and sits back down at the piano. She sighs and looks at me. I walk over to her and move her towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll talk to him,&#34; I whisper. She nods and thanks me before walking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was awkward,&#34; I say and look at him. He shakes his head and then looks at me. &#34;Since when were you so cold and domineering? I kind of like this side of you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it turns you on, I can do something about it,&#34; he jokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And your back to the Carl I dislike,&#34; I say and sit on one of the chairs. &#34;What&#39;s going on with you two? The student office doesn&#39;t take a student off the register; you have to tell them to do that.&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I started this job, she stopped showing up to the lesson. After a couple of weeks I decided just to take her off the register, makes it easier and it doesn&#39;t put a mark against her record,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But if she needs the credits,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She can get them from a different subject,&#34; he cuts in. I sigh as I realise I won&#39;t win this right now. I&#39;ll probably try again tomorrow.</p>
