                <p>His hand moves, his fingers lightly touch my skin. His lips press against my shoulder and over my collar bone. His kisses move down my chest until I feel his lips close around my nipple. I bite my top lip and slowly release it. He pulls back and his hand moves down over my panties and down the inner part of my thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel his lips back on my skin, they move from the middle of my chest to my other breast and then down my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; he says against my belly button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I breathe. I feel his hand move to the hem of my panties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I touch you?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; is all I can say as I feel his fingers caressing just under my panty line. He moves his hand into my panties and slowly moves the strap of my underwear down a little at the side. His hand moves in a direction I didn&#39;t expect which is around my thigh to the side of it and he slowly caresses up and down the scars at my thigh. I move my hand to my thigh to stop him touching my scars. &#34;Don&#39;t,&#34; I say moving his hand from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok,&#34; he says moving his hand back to my thigh. &#34;Your scars don&#39;t bother me, you know that,&#34; he says and he kisses my knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s just...&#34; I trail off and gulp down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These aren&#39;t self-inflicted,&#34; he says and I shake my head. He sighs against my knee and rests his head on my knee. &#34;Ok,&#34; he says and his fingers slowly caress my scars. He takes his hand off my thigh and kisses up my leg. He kisses up my body and stops at my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel his lips press on my lips as his hand moves down my stomach and at the hem of my panties. His hand moves inside my panties. I inhale deeply through my nose and he kisses me much faster, I move my hand up to his shoulder round to his neck and move my leg up a little as his hand moves more into my panties. I pull back little to catch my breath and then press my lips back to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan&#39;s fingers move over my sex and slowly caress my entrance. A finger slowly enters inside me. A moan vibrates from my lips to his. I pull away as I feel the finger move out and then over my sex once more and he repeats the action only this time moving two fingers inside me. His kisses move down my neck to my breasts. I moan again and move my hand through his hair and grip his hand tight with my other hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having his hand in mine makes me feel safe, that he&#39;s with me the whole time and that it&#39;s him the Logan I know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I moan as his hand moves faster and his thumb massages on a certain part of my sex. I feel his lips on my breasts, his tongue swirling around my nipple. I moan again and he takes his hand out from my panties and pulls my panties down. I feel them move down my legs and him kiss down my body. I flick my tongue along my lips to moisten them and move my hand though his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to stop?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I say and feel him kiss my stomach. I giggle a little as I feel him rub his cheek along my stomach. His stubble tickles. His hand moves to my thigh and he lifts my leg a little as he kisses my sex. &#34;Ahhh,&#34; I groan and move my hand from his head to my hair. &#34;Logan,&#34; I breathe as I feel his tongue on me and his stubble against my clit. His tongue swirls inside me and then out. He sucks on the nub of my clit and my whole body sinks into deep pleasure. The softness of his tongue is a big contrast to stubble skimming my six every time his mouth moves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I haven&#39;t felt pleasure like this before. I always wondered what it would feel like for someone to kiss me down there. I wonder if it always feels this good, or he&#39;s just good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile a little and bite my bottom lip as I feel my body become tense. My toes curl and I move my leg up a little resting my foot on his back. A moan escapes me as my back arches and I reach my climax. I move my hand down my body and grip my leg and tighten my grip on his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; he says once he pulls away from me. &#34;You can open your eyes now,&#34; I smile and open my eyes to look at him. He gives me a small grin and kisses my knee that it is next to his ear. &#34;How are you feeling?&#34; he asks. I smile and feel myself blush. I place my hands to my cheeks and I can feel how hot my face is. I feel him move and place my leg back on the bed. &#34;I&#39;ll be back,&#34; he says and walks towards the living area. I sit up and look around for my underwear. I then feel something drop over my shoulders. I look to see Logan moving his shirt around me. I smile and move my arms into his shirt and then button the three middle buttons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at him once I&#39;m covered to see him stand and walk into the bathroom. I walk towards the living area and pick up the bottle of champagne left and pour a little into a glass and then sip it. I walk back to the bedroom and I see my panties on the floor. I pick them up and then place the glass on the bedside table and put on my panties</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan returns with a towel in his hand. I give him a small smile and watch as he dries his hands. He kneels on the bed and drops the towel on the floor as he moves towards me and kisses me on the lips. I pull back and lay down on the bed. I then notice the bulge in his jeans. I chew the side of my mouth and watch him lay down at the side of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I say turning on my side and resting my head on my hand. He looks at me and copies my position. I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Megan?&#34; he asks in camp voice probably trying to mimic me. I take a minute to contemplate my question and bite my lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re turned on,&#34; I state and he smirks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can tell?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, so do you want me to do anything to help?&#34; I ask and he chuckles a little and lies on his back. He looks at me with a smile creasing his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ok, I can take care of it myself,&#34; I say and I sit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I want to,&#34; I say frowning; I&#39;m a little offended that he doesn&#39;t want me to touch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm, ok,&#34; he says and pulls his jeans off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I say and he smiles a little and kicks off his jeans. He lies with his legs spread and his arms spread so he looks like a sat up star.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do what you want to me, just be gentle, I&#39;m a delicate man,&#34; he says with his eyes closed and head tilted back with a grin on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up,&#34; I say taking his arm and moving it down. &#34;Will you take me seriously,&#34; I snap and he looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; he says and moves his arms around me and pulls me on top of him. I straddle his thighs and place my hands on his chest. &#34;You&#39;re too cute sometimes,&#34; he says and I smile a little and move my hands down his abdomen over his very worked on six pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at his lap and tilt my head. It looks bigger than I expected but then again I don&#39;t know what I expected. I feel him move a hand to the back of my neck causing me to look at him. He leans in and kisses me, his tongue moving into my mouth. I slowly move my hand into his boxers and pull on them with my other hand to give me more access. I may seem calm right now but I&#39;m nervous, I want to be able to pleasure him the way he pleasured me.</p>
