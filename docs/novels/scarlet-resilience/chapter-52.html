                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk out of the office and stand in the hallway as I wait for Logan. I look around, this hallway wasn&#39;t always as full as the others, the main reason being the fact the headmistress&#39;s office is here and so is the staffroom and the meeting room. Logan walks out of the office and looks at me. I give him a small smile and look down, taking a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to go to my locker,&#34; I say. He nodded and I looked down the hall &#34;but it&#39;s in a busy part of school,&#34; I said and moved my hands in my pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; he said, &#34;I guess I&#39;ll walk with you but just for today,&#34; he said pointing his finger at me &#34;Ok?&#34; he asked. I nod and he presses his finger onto my nose. My nose scrunches and he smirks as he walks off. I frown and pout as I walk behind him. And then slowly realise that the hall is getting busier and busier as people notice me they start to stop talking and just stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I said quietly as I walked beside him. He looks at me blankly for a moment. I swear he had another world in there somewhere. &#34;People are looking at me,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm are you sure it&#39;s not me and my amazing hotness, I have that effect on people,&#34; he said, running his hand through his hair. I shake my head a little and smile. &#34;That&#39;s better,&#34; he said and then stopped at my locker.  I look around and see nearly everyone in the hallway looking at me but trying their best to make it not obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I unlock my locker and take out my books. I look at Logan and he sighs and holds out his hands and then looks around. &#34;Shouldn&#39;t you all be at class?&#34; he asks &#34;I&#39;m sure the first bell has gone,&#34; and then the bell goes &#34;and there&#39;s the second bell it seems you all want to have a week of detentions with me, I&#39;m flattered I really am,&#34; he said and while he&#39;s saying this people are dispersing saying bye to their friends and then walking to class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile forms on my face and I then take my books back from him and hold them myself &#34;You can go now,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I will believe it or not I&#39;m teaching,&#34; he states &#34;I am however walking you to your class remember,&#34; he states. I sigh and walk with him to my math lesson. He opens the door for me and I take a deep breath and look in to see everyone sitting quietly ready to work. I gulp down the lump in my throat and I feel Logan&#39;s hand on the small of my back. &#34;Sorry she&#39;s late,&#34; he said and pushed me into the room. And I thought he was being comforting with his hand on my back obviously not. I look at him and he waves and shuts the door, he was evil deep inside, he would pass as one of those evil villains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the room stares at me and I take a deep breath and give them a small wave. This was torture why did I even have to come to school, tutoring would be so much easier and it isn&#39;t like my grandfather can&#39;t afford it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take a seat Megan,&#34; My math teacher says. I look at him and nod a little and walk to the back to where my seat was situated. &#34;Ok,&#34; he said and picked up a piece of paper and walked towards me with it and placed it on my desk. &#34;Have you done the work that was set for you?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frown and look through my bag and then sigh and shake my head. He sighs a little &#34;I didn&#39;t know I had some work,&#34; I say. With Mr Broster he gets angry if you don&#39;t do as he asks. I have always done his work but it&#39;s like he gets irritated if things aren&#39;t done. He is a bit OCD but I guess he just likes things done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re really behind,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I figured,&#34; I said and looked down and moved my hair from my eyes. Was he serious? I&#39;ve been off school for just over 2 months. I&#39;m going to be behind. &#34;I guess I was told but I&#39;ve been really busy,&#34; I said and his face got angrier &#34;I mean with my check ups and Psych sessions and urm...&#34; I trail off and look down. I never even knew I had work to do. Logan hadn&#39;t given me anything and nothing was sent to my house. How was I supposed to know that I had work?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jeez lighten up will you? I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll do the work when she can,&#34; Tyler says. I look at him and then Mr Broster. He looks around to see all the class looking at him and then walks away, I sigh in relief and look at Tyler and give him a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk out of class and walk towards the English department and as I make it to Logan&#39;s room I feel someone walk by my side. I look to see Tyler there. He smiles and his dark green eyes scan my face as he does.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; he asks &#34;don&#39;t you have gym?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said quietly &#34;but I need to talk to Mr Peters,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About earlier?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened earlier?&#34; I hear Logan&#39;s voice ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well...&#34; Tyler starts</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; I said, interrupting Tyler. &#34;I&#39;m gonna go to gym,&#34; I said and walked past them both and quickly made my way to the gyms changing rooms. I did not want to do gym at all, I stopped turning up to it once the beatings got bad and the bruises became more visible but now I knew that the girls will definitely be looking for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My back wasn&#39;t fully healed, it was still scabbed and peeling and I just would not be able to cope with them looking at that. Closing my eyes once I was in the changing room I hoped for no one to notice me, but the fact it had gone dead silent told me they had noticed me. I opened my eyes and walked to an empty bench and sat down. Melanie sits next to me and looks straight at me. I give her a small smile and sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long do you think this will last?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably about two weeks,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t get changed for P.E,&#34; I said looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can, don&#39;t think about it. You have nothing to be ashamed of and so what if they look or stare none of it is your fault,&#34; she states &#34;now get changed Megan Anne Wright,&#34; she orders. I smile weakly at her and look away. &#34;Ok,&#34; she sighs &#34;how about we wait for everyone to get changed and leave, then we&#39;ll get changed?&#34; she says. I nod and move my head in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I hear someone say. I look to see a red haired girl popping her head round from the lockers. She was small, very petite and she had the most intense green eyes I had ever seen. &#34;We don&#39;t care you know,&#34; she states, &#34;come round here and get change because we all know what you&#39;ve gone through and for us to judge you over it would be very evil of us,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not that,&#34; I said &#34;it&#39;s personal more than anything,&#34; I said quietly &#34;I just don&#39;t feel comfortable or confident enough to change around you all,&#34; and all of them started to move into where me and Melanie were sitting. &#34;But thank you anyway,&#34; I said and looked down. I lift my sleeve and scratch at my wrist and I notice Melanie staring at it. I quickly cover it and look at her. She sighs and takes my hair in her hands and starts to plait it.</p>
