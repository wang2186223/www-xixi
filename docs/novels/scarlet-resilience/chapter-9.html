                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan was now laid on my chest fast asleep, her legs entwined with mine. She had fallen asleep half way through the film and was now out cold. I had moved the blanket from the back of the couch over her as soon as she fell asleep on me like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned the TV off now the movie had finished and slowly sat up while holding her up being careful not to wake her. She stirred but went silent when I stopped moving. I moved from underneath her and let her rest on the back rest of the couch. I stood and then picked her up bridal style; she stirred once more as we exited the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making my way to her bedroom she stirred again but this time woke fully. She lifted her head up off my shoulder and looked around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to sleep in there,&#34; she said tiredly. I looked at her &#34;can I sleep with you?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm...yeah,&#34; I said, a little surprised by what she asked. I turned and walked to my room which was opposite her room but a little further away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; she said quietly and placed her head back on my shoulder.  I walked into my room and placed her on my bed and pulled back the covers on the other side and slowly and gently moved her onto the side that was now exposed and then covered her with the bed covers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled my top off and then took my jeans off so I was just in my boxers. I threw my clothes into the wash basket and took some joggers from my drawer and pulled them on and moved onto the bed but stayed on top of the covers and moved my arm round her taking her hand in mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were leaving me for a second,&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I won&#39;t ever leave you,&#34; I said quietly and moved closer to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good because I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do if you ever did,&#34; she said twining her fingers with mine</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to worry,&#34; I said and kissed the back of her head. She smiled and slowly went back to sleep. I smiled and within fifteen minutes I too was asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat watching her trying to make sure she didn&#39;t notice. It was Tuesday night and I doubt she had slept since Saturday night judging by how many times she&#39;s caught herself asleep. Anyone else would have laughed at how many times her head jerked up from falling but I couldn&#39;t laugh. I was worried. I had already suggested for her to go up to bed twice but she wasn&#39;t having it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenth time now. I sigh and stand &#34;C&#39;mon,&#34; I said moving towards her. She looked up at me &#34;you&#39;re off to bed,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head &#34;No...No I&#39;m ok,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you&#39;re not and you need some sleep,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I don&#39;t, I slept last night,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you didn&#39;t and you didn&#39;t sleep the night before that, you haven&#39;t slept since you slept in my bed,&#34; I state. She looked away from me. &#34;You can sleep in my bed if you like and if you start to have a nightmare I&#39;ll wake you up,&#34; I suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re willing to stay up the whole night making sure I don&#39;t have a nightmare?&#34; she asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as it means you get some sleep, yes,&#34; I state sternly. She sighs and stood up and as she stood the doorbell went. She sat back down and I walked to the door. I opened the door to see Tyler standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see your leg has healed.&#34;he said looking down at my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah you could have said that,&#34; I paused. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm sorry, I came to see Megan,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you see her in the hospital?&#34; I ask  folding my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was in hospital,&#34;he said quietly &#34;I was also banned from seeing her,&#34;he states. I frowned slightly &#34;I haven&#39;t exactly been in a good condition,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah neither has she,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it sounds like I&#39;m making this shit up and that I didn&#39;t want to see her but I did I just wasn&#39;t allowed,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I got sectioned ok!&#34; he snapped. I raised my eyebrows slightly. &#34;I suffer from schizophrenia and a few days after she was in hospital I was sectioned as I wasn&#39;t taking my medication and I was drinking and well let&#39;s just say I have a lot of apologising to do,&#34;he states.  &#34;I&#39;ve only been out about a week and I&#39;ve been banned from seeing her. So can I see her please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll see if she wants to see you?&#34; I state</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34;he said, relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked back into the living room to see her lying there with her eyes closed. I sigh and sit on top of the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tyler&#39;s at the door for you,&#34; I state. Her eyes slowly opened and she looked up at me. &#34;Do you want to see him?&#34; She sighs and sits up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; she said, getting up off the couch and walking off to the door. I sigh and drop onto the couch. I suddenly hated that boy with a passion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>----Megan</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood in front of Tyler. He was in his usual baggy jeans and tight top; he had lost weight since I last saw him. He smiled at me and I looked away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie told me about you being sectioned,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but I&#39;m ok now,&#34;he said, moving closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you stupid?&#34; I asked  him. He gave me a confused look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What possessed you Tyler to stop taking your meds?&#34; I snapped. He looked down and away from me &#34;I swear you lose brain cells every day,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34;he said, walking over to me. &#34;But I&#39;m ok now and I&#39;m taking them again and I&#39;m not going to stop taking them,&#34; he went to move his hands around my waist but I moved out of his grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now that you&#39;re out of that hell, we can be together like old times,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t,&#34; I mutter. He looked at me &#34;We can&#39;t be together Tyler,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;m not ready for us to be together I&#39;m not ready for any relationship,&#34; I paused &#34;I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s you Tyler it&#39;s me I can&#39;t stand it when people touch me or if anyone comes too close to me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you can live with a guy you&#39;ve known for about five months?&#34; he asks. I sigh and sit on the bottom step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t understand,&#34; I mutter &#34;he&#39;s the only person I trust,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you don&#39;t trust me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not saying that,&#34; I said quietly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes you are,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want from me Tyler?&#34; I ask  &#34;look at the state of me, I&#39;m a mess,&#34; I state &#34;I don&#39;t sleep, I don&#39;t eat and this is probably the most I&#39;ve talked since I woke up in hospital for the first time,&#34; I snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just need you as a friend at the moment,&#34; I said looking up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; he said &#34;I understand,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I said standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re ok,&#34;he said quietly &#34;and I should of told someone straight away I mean I know it would have been breaking the promise I made but it would have stopped everything and I could have lost you and,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tyler,&#34; I said, cutting in. He looked at me &#34;it&#39;s ok you were just doing what I told you to do,&#34; I said smiling. He smiled and went to hug me but I stepped back and just held my hand out. He muttered a sorry and shook my hand. &#34;I&#39;m working on my contact,&#34; I said quietly. He smiled and just shook my hand once more. I smiled slightly and watched him walk away from me and out of the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped back on the step and rested my head on my knees and hugged myself. My stomach hurt like hell and I knew why. I&#39;m surprised Logan hasn&#39;t force fed me yet with the fact I&#39;ve only eaten a handful of grapes since being here. It wasn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t want to eat, I was scared to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m gonna have to put you on a drip if you don&#39;t start eating something soon,&#34; I heard him say. I looked at him. He sighs &#34;did he upset you?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I mumbled and hid my face from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your favourite food?&#34; he asks, his voice sounding closer than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have a favourite, not anymore,&#34; I said moving my head up a little so I could see where he was and he was knelt in front of me, his blue eyes staring back at me. He moved his hand onto mine and slowly moved my hand off my knee and held my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why won&#39;t you eat something?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bad things happen when I eat,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What bad things will happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I put weight on,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing bad will happen I promise you,&#34;he states. I looked at him &#34;have I broken any promises to you?&#34; he asked. I slowly shook my head. &#34;Well then?&#34; he asks &#34;are you going to eat some toast for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to sleep,&#34; I said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it&#39;s half six so do you want to have an hour nap and have something to eat and then go back to bed?&#34; he asks &#34;and well you have to be up around ten tomorrow as you have a session with the psychologist.&#34; I sigh</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you don&#39;t want to go but you have to, I&#39;m still seeing my physio which I don&#39;t think I need to do as I&#39;m walking now I may be limping but I&#39;m walking, but I guess it&#39;s more to make sure everything is working properly,&#34;he states to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your leg hurts a lot though doesn&#39;t it?&#34; I ask . He nodded &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I said quietly. He sighed and stroked my hand with his thumb. He then moved his hand out of mine and to my head slowly running his fingers through my hair as he looked into my eyes. I smiled and felt myself blush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on,&#34;he said slowly, standing up and moving his hand into mine and pulling me up. I stood and walked with him back into the living room. Logan ushered me to the couch and I sat down. &#34;Lay down,&#34; he ordered. I smiled slightly and lay on my side; he pulled a blanket over me and ruffled my hair. &#34;Now go to sleep,&#34; he yawned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t slept either,&#34; I said looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have just not a lot,&#34;he says. I sigh and opened the blanket to him &#34;Megan its fine,&#34; I still held the blanket out at him. He sighs slightly and smiles as he gets in next to me. &#34;You know if we both fall asleep we&#39;re not going to get up,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will,&#34; I said and laid still. He moved his arms around my shoulders and pulled me close to him. I sigh and close my eyes as I move closer to him until my head touches his chest. I wasn&#39;t scared to sleep when he was near me and I had a feeling I wouldn&#39;t have a nightmare as long as he was near me. I know that as long as he is near me I am safe and nothing will hurt me.</p>
