                <p>&#34;Ok Logan, now try bending your leg,&#34; Logan&#39;s physiotherapist said. She was of Japanese ethnic and had long black shiny hair. Her build was petite and she wore the same white coat as what Megan&#39;s doctor wore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan had started to see his physiotherapist as soon as he woke up but only went to a few sessions but ever since Megan finally woke up he made sure he had meetings every day. She wasn&#39;t much conversation when he went to see her. She just laid on her side not saying a word to anyone she did however mutter a few things to herself and when she noticed people looking at her she&#39;d make an effort to smile at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan focused and his leg twitched up slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok urm maybe we should take a break for a while,&#34; the woman suggested. Logan sighed in frustration &#34;don&#39;t worry these things take time, you&#39;ve made a great process.&#34; The woman reassured me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan didn&#39;t say anything and made his way back into the wheelchair. Eric smiled slightly and wheeled Logan out of the Physiotherapists office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow,&#34; she said smiling and shut the door behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you take me to the room her father is in?&#34; Logan asked his uncle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; he asked, surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to see how he&#39;s doing,&#34; he said, moving his hand over his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan I don&#39;t&#34; Logan cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, I can&#39;t exactly do anything, can I? With only one leg working,&#34; he snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Eric said, defeated and took Logan to where Jonathon was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After five minutes they were outside the room he was in. There was a police officer standing outside his door and another not far down the hall. From the window Logan could see inside. Anger rose in him as he noticed him asleep. It annoyed him how he could sleep yet Megan was too scared to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s sedated,&#34; a voice sounded from his side. He turned to see it was a woman in a dark grey suit. She was a redhead and quite slim. &#34;I never knew he was ill&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; Logan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His secretary,&#34; the redhead said and looked back at the man lying in the bed in the room. &#34;He keeps asking to see his daughter yet they won&#39;t let him which is a shame really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Logan asked angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not fully sure what has happened but-&#34; Logan cut her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not allowed to see her because he&#39;s being beating her,&#34; Logan snapped. The woman&#39;s face fell and she shook her head &#34;why the hell do you think there&#39;s a police officer stood at his door, his daughter is on a different ward and is still on observation,&#34; Logan paused &#34;he&#39;s not some fucking saint you know,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...I didn&#39;t know. No one has told me anything. All I know is that he&#39;s mentally ill,&#34; the woman said, still with shock on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah well now you do,&#34; Logan snapped and looked at Eric &#34;can you take me back now?&#34; he asked. Eric nodded and started to push Logan back to Megan&#39;s room. The red head followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait can you tell me everything as I know nothing and well if he&#39;s done what you&#39;ve said he&#39;s done then I want to make sure she&#39;s ok,&#34; Eric stopped Logan and Logan looked at the woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever,&#34; he muttered and started to wheel himself to Megan&#39;s room. He didn&#39;t care if she followed him or not he couldn&#39;t exactly stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked out the window, her eyes laced with clear salty water. She had heard someone come into the room but she didn&#39;t turn to see who it was. She didn&#39;t care who it was as long as it wasn&#39;t the man who made her the way she was now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan the doctor is here to see you,&#34; Lynn said. Megan gave no indication that she had heard Lynn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; the doctor said, walking into Megan&#39;s view. &#34;I have something to tell you,&#34; by the tone of his voice she could tell it was something bad. She slowly looked him in the eyes. &#34;When you came into hospital,&#34; he stopped when the door opened again. At the corner of her eye she saw Logan and Eric and a woman she only knew by face. Megan turned her attention back to the doctor. &#34;Can I continue with these people here?&#34; the doctor asks. Megan nods in response. &#34;Urm...&#34; he said while sitting down on the chair next to her bed by the window. &#34;The night you came into hospital and we prepped you for surgery and while we were doing the surgery to stop the bleeding we found that you were pregnant,&#34; he explained. Megan slowly closed her eyes and then opened them again &#34;and we also found that you have had quite a few miscarriages, we are not sure for definite but the miscarriages may have damaged your womb. The recent miscarriage has done most of the damage because you had internal bleeding as well. I am not saying this is for definite, that is why we will need to do more tests later in time.&#34; The doctor explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan turned her gaze back outside watching the rain fall. &#34;It&#39;s nearly Christmas,&#34; she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In a week,&#34; the doctor stated. Megan didn&#39;t say anything and tilted her head back so her head was now resting on the pillow. &#34;Ok,&#34; the doctor said standing up, &#34;someone will come in later on to talk to you now that you are well enough to see people,&#34; he explained. Megan didn&#39;t reply but her eyes followed him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan wheeled himself to her and gave her a small smile. She didn&#39;t return it; she turned her head back out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Megan,&#34; she heard a woman say. Megan didn&#39;t reply. The woman moved in the direction of Megan&#39;s gaze &#34;How are you feeling?&#34; the woman asked. Megan sighed and looked up at the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can someone put the TV on please?&#34; she muttered. There was a long silence which caused Megan to look around the room to see all the reluctant faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; the woman said with a confused look on her face. The red head took the TV remote from the shelf and pressed the TV on. Within a couple of seconds the TV hummed to life and straight away they were faced with the news. &#34;Do you want me to turn it over?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Megan said &#34;thank you,&#34; she mumbled and closed her eyes. She didn&#39;t care for what was on the TV; she just wanted some sound in the room. She was sick of thinking about the same thing all the time. She hated night time more than anything in the world right now. It was the worst time. She couldn&#39;t close her eyes without an image coming into her mind scaring her half to death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; she heard Logan ask her. She opened her eyes and looked at him. She scanned his body with her eyes. She hated herself; she felt it was her fault he was in the wheelchair having to go see a physiotherapist practically every day just so he could walk again. She didn&#39;t understand how he could still look at her the way he does and still be in the same room as her, without getting angry at her and hurting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan didn&#39;t reply, she just slowly looked away from him and looked at the TV to see a brunette woman holding a microphone in her hand. Megan frowned slightly because the place the woman was at seemed familiar to her. &#34;Could you turn this up please?&#34; she asked whoever was listening. The sound on the TV slowly rose and what the woman was saying became clearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am stood outside the family where the poor girl was beaten and raped by her own father,&#34; Megan&#39;s jaw dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Turn it off,&#34; she said. They looked at her &#34;turn it off,&#34; she snapped. The TV went off and Megan went silent. They all knew that what had happened to her was going to be on the news and they knew telling her would have a big effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you all leave please?&#34; she asked. The red head looked at her &#34;Now,&#34; she said. They nodded and slowly walked out. Logan stayed where he was and looked at her &#34;why didn&#39;t you tell me?&#34; she asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought it would be best not to,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what have me wondering why all my classmates are talking and whispering about me when I got to school,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry I probably should have told you,&#34; he paused &#34;I was just trying to protect you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need protecting,&#34; she paused and started to move the covers off her body &#34;and I do not need to be here anymore,&#34; she said and lifted up her leg that was in a pot and took the crutches from the side of her bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan you&#39;re not well enough you still need&#34; she cut him off</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I don&#39;t need to stay here I&#39;m fine I need to go see my father,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? You know he&#39;s here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I do, a woman came in earlier and told my doctor about him,&#34; she answered and started to lift herself up with the help of the crutches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan you can&#39;t be serious about seeing him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am serious and no one can stop me,&#34; she snapped while hopping along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; Logan said and wheeled himself to the door and turned to look at her. She sighed and looked at him her eyes slowly starting to water. &#34;You can&#39;t go see him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the hell not? He&#39;s my father,&#34; she snapped angrily. This was the first time since she woke up she had showed any emotion. Logan sighed and then looked at her seeing the look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For one they won&#39;t allow you to see him and two there&#39;s no way in hell I am letting you,&#34; he snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you intend to get involved in my life so much? Do you not realise that I do not need you?&#34; she asked angrily &#34;I need to see him to make sure he is ok and I need you to leave me the fuck alone,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you so angry at me? I have done nothing but care for you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I ask you to? No I didn&#39;t&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes you did if I&#39;m not mistaken the night I got shot was the night you called me up asking for my help,&#34; he retorted. She sighed and looked up at the ceiling holding back her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you not think I know that it is my fault that you are in the wheelchair? Why do you think I can&#39;t look at you?&#34; she snapped and moved her hand to her chest. &#34;I don&#39;t understand you,&#34; she cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan sighed and put the break on his wheelchair &#34;you&#39;re angry at yourself?&#34; he asked. She nodded and wiped the tears from her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The reason we are both here is because of me, because I was stupid to think that the jerk I called dad could get help. The only reason I want to see him is because I know I will have nothing else but him outside this hospital,&#34; Megan moved her hand back to her chest as her breathing became shallow. Logan frowned and pushed himself up out of the wheelchair putting all his weight on one foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not true,&#34; he stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it I have no mom I have no one I do have a grandfather that I hate for hating me mother but apart from that I have no one,&#34; she cried and stepped closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s funny how they say that the guy is the dumb one at seeing things like this,&#34; he muttered to himself and moved forward putting his hand on the bed for support. &#34;You have me and you may think you don&#39;t but you do&#34; he stated and pulled her close to him. &#34;Please stop trying to distance yourself from me and let me help you. Please,&#34; he said kissing the top of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help me now because I can&#39;t breathe,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; he asked pulling away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t breathe Logan,&#34; she said and collapsed onto the floor, her vision going blurry and fading back into nothingness.</p>
