                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When a hurricane hits, it crashes through a village or a city in a matter of seconds, creating destruction and mess all around and moves onto the next without looking back to see the mess it created. It just keeps going through city after city. It&#39;s only after the hurricane has died off do you get to look at the destruction and fix it. You and Logan seem to be like that. You&#39;re emotions just hit and crash through one another without realising the mess you made on each other and I think having your uncle at home with you both will give you both a chance to reflect on how you feel about one another and the obstacles you have both faced to then be able to fix yourselves,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does that make sense?&#34; she asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re saying we&#39;re intense emotionally,&#34; I say and she nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you see that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I suppose,&#34; I say as I think about how we are together, &#34;when things are good between us no words can really describe it but when it&#39;s bad it&#39;s like everything physically hurts, there&#39;s no real middle or constant I guess,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; she says with a small smile and I smile in return. &#34;Speak to him or I can book you in for a session tomorrow for both of you if you like and we can discuss everything a little further if you like?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow is a bit soon,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s fine I have emergency appointments every day and I can slot you both in then, plus we need to discuss other things that have happened,&#34; she pauses &#34;is he picking you up? Are you happy to have him in a session with you?&#34; she asks. I nod, &#34;Good,&#34; she says with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch her stand up and then walk out of the room. I close my eyes and take a deep breath to slowly let it out as I calm myself down. She&#39;s right, having my uncle at home will help us because we can&#39;t be all over each other and it&#39;ll give us time to ourselves. Which I guess is healthy in a relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walks back in with Logan behind her. He looks at me and gives me a small smile. I watch him walk in and sit down near me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, how&#39;s the session going?&#34; he asks. I shrug and look down at my hands as he places his hand into mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I think it may be best if we have a session tomorrow, with you,&#34; my therapist tells him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; Logan says looking at me.&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She says we have an unhealthy relationship,&#34; I state and watch as he tilts his head a little and I can see he&#39;s thinking about that. He turns to look at my therapist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can see why you would say that,&#34; he states surprising me, &#34;I would argue we could be worse given our personal histories,&#34; he says looking straight at her and the look he&#39;s giving her is intense as if he&#39;s challenging her. To what I&#39;m not sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is true,&#34; she states quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I&#39;m just going to say this once to you,&#34; and he stands up and loosens his tie. &#34;The last person that tried to break us up I ruined, don&#39;t think I won&#39;t do that to you,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you threatening me?&#34; she asks standing up also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s a promise. Megan is someone I care for a lot, and if I thought this wasn&#39;t healthy for her or if I wasn&#39;t good for her I would end this for her, and only her,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not trying to break you both up,&#34; she says. &#34;I just want to have you at one of her sessions just so you both can talk in a safe space,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess we&#39;re on the same page then,&#34; he states and then looks at me, &#34;Are we leaving?&#34; he asks. I nod and stand. &#34;We will see you tomorrow, at 4, is that a good time?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Six is better,&#34; she states. He smirks to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Six it is,&#34; he says and walks out. I give her a small smile and walk out with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walk out into the reception to see Courtney sat in the waiting room with her phone in front of her. She looks up at us and smiles at Logan before noticing me behind her and she just glares at me. I roll my eyes and walk to the desk to sign my name out and then walk out of the building. I didn&#39;t know she was in therapy, out of all the therapists in California she has the same as me. I&#39;d like to think that&#39;s a coincidence but given who Courtney is I&#39;m not so sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; I ask once we&#39;re in the car. He nods, I look at David to see him frown before starting the car. Logan moves his hand into mine &#34;I&#39;m fine, just don&#39;t need another person trying to break us up,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, neither do I, but she said it was more emotional, with everything that went on in England she just said it seems we&#39;re like a hurricane or something when it comes to our emotions, I think she wants us to discuss it together,&#34; I explain and he nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get that, I&#39;ll play nice,&#34; he says and pulls me to sit next to him and kisses me on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch at the door of the gym as Brett does another bench press. When we came back he was in here, he stopped to eat and then came straight back here. He didn&#39;t say much at dinner, no one did really. The mood was quite somber, Carl was unusually quiet and the only two that seemed to be in better spirits was David and his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong Megan?&#34; he asks. I smile and walk in to sit on the bench next to the one he is sat on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wanted to know if you were ok,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Considering everything, yes I am,&#34; I frown at his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Last night I&#39;d only seen fear like that in the people I tried to keep safe in the war,&#34; he states. &#34;I never thought I&#39;d see that kind of fear in you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was my nightmare,&#34; I say quietly and look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it wasn&#39;t, it was part of it but you&#39;re petrified,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not of you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of my brother who I look a lot alike,&#34; he states. &#34;And with him on the run, it&#39;s only natural for you to be scared,&#34; he pauses and moves the towel to his face wiping the sweat. &#34;I dunno, I just, I promised your mother I&#39;d keep you safe and I failed,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You weren&#39;t to know he was going to do what he did,&#34; I say. &#34;I don&#39;t blame you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you blame?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Him, Jonathan, he&#39;s not my father, not anymore, he chose to stop taking his meds to control the shifts, he also decided not to get help after I had told him about everything,&#34; I explain and he smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re stronger than me,&#34; he says standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m not,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re here, many would have given up,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Most days I think of giving up,&#34; I say looking down and then hear Logan walk in with David behind him. I look towards him. &#34;But I&#39;m lucky I have people that care about me enough to not let me think about it for too long,&#34; I state and then look back at my uncle. He nods and looks at Logan before looking back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m gonna go do my homework,&#34; I state and walk out of the gym.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t hit me in the face,&#34; I say to David as he bandages my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re lacking in your training, it&#39;s your own fault,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not fair, I have a job now, turning up with bruises on my face isn&#39;t exactly work appropriate,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine the face is off-limits,&#34; he states and tapes my hands. We bump fists and then step away from each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do I feel like you&#39;re disappointed by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am, I like to see my work,&#34; he says and gets into position. I do the same and straight away he makes his move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had noticed Brett in the Gym when I walked in. It seemed he and Megan were having a serious conversation. He&#39;s been quiet since Megan came home. Lorraine had said she had hardly seen him since this morning, she was still trying to get used to the house. It&#39;s smaller than the one she&#39;s used to in England but there&#39;s also fewer mouths for her to feed, that didn&#39;t stop her from making enough food for a small army. Luckily for her, there&#39;s the security staff she can feed. I think that made her happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, David delighted me in telling me he wanted to see if I&#39;d kept up with my training. When I was younger he trained me in a few martial art techniques and well I haven&#39;t exactly kept up to them and he knows it. This means I&#39;m about to get my arse handed to me.</p>
