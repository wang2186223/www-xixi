                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan moves his hand onto my knee as David drives us down the motorway to the airport. I feel my heart pound against my ribcage and my hands become damp with sweat. The thought of going back home scares the hell out of me. No one has found Jonathon and it&#39;s kind of freaking me out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok? You&#39;ve gone quiet,&#34; he states. I nod in response and lay my head on his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m worried about going home,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;ll be ok, I promise, I&#39;ve put security in place, we&#39;ll discuss it more when we&#39;re on the plane,&#34; he states. I sigh in response and hold his hand in mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look to the rearview mirror to see David glance at me and give me a small smile before moving his attention back to the road. He most likely thinks I&#39;m being pathetic, but the thought of going back home gives me anxiety. It&#39;s as if I have a ball of fear in the pit of my stomach and the closer we get to going back to America it&#39;s growing in size.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan explained to me on the flight back that we now have a team of security at the house and a team that will come with me to school and wherever I go. David will drive me to and from school, a female security guard will follow me around the school and there will be a few walking around the perimeter of the school or any establishment I will be in. I&#39;m not sure how I feel about being followed. Logan and David both assured me that I probably won&#39;t notice them but I&#39;m not so sure about that. I just have to remember that it&#39;s for my own safety. David explained that he&#39;d handpicked them all which leads me to believe he&#39;s not just a driver for Logan and I&#39;m not sure what to make of that. I had my suspicions with what Logan has told me but I&#39;m now thinking he&#39;s probably an ex-army or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flight back was uneventful well until I fell asleep and ended up having a nightmare. The others all got taxi&#39;s back to theirs and there was a car waiting for David, Logan and I. Carl got in a taxi with Yasmin, I heard him tell Logan he needed to talk to her. I couldn&#39;t help but ask David if it felt wrong to him to have someone else drive seen as that is all I&#39;ve seen him do. He just smirked at me and shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were told once in the car that my grandfather was waiting for us at the house. Logan didn&#39;t seem too pleased by that and to be honest neither am I. The thought of seeing him just brings too many feelings to the surface for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I climb out of the car into the hot California sunshine. Instinct tells me to look around and assess my surroundings. The thought that Benjamin could be watching me right now terrifies me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front door opens and my grandfather is standing watching us as we take our suitcases out of the car. Logan and David look like they&#39;re both going to tell me they can take mine but seem to dismiss it as I glare at them. I need to focus on something other than what is going on right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk to the front door, pulling my suitcase with me. My grandfather gives me a big grin and goes to give me a hug. I step out of his reach and move past him to go inside the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone&#39;s here to see you,&#34; he states and I feel my heart jump into my throat as panic starts to take over my body. He&#39;s surely not stupid enough to have helped Benjamin and then bring him here. I look at Logan to see him frown at my grandfather too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;God, you look more and more like your mother every time I see you,&#34; I hear a male voice say. I look behind my grandfather to see my uncle. He&#39;s built like a house and I can&#39;t help but walk towards him and give him a hug. I&#39;ve not seen him since my mother&#39;s funeral. Brett has always been in my life, he was more than an uncle, he was my best friend. I&#39;d come to him when I was angry at both my mother and father, he was my second dad. The person that has always protected and comforted me. I stopped contact with him when things got bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brett wraps his massive muscled arms around me and lifts me off my feet as he hugs me back. &#34;It&#39;s OK, kid,&#34; he says in my ear. I feel my eyes fill with tears, &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he whispers. I shake my head in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling back I look up at my uncle. I wipe my tears from my cheeks and he gives me a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve missed you,&#34; I say and his smile gets wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You too kid,&#34; he says and looks over my shoulder at Logan and David. His eyebrows come together in a frown over the same green eyes that I have. &#34;Who are they?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; I say, turning and bringing him to meet Logan and David. &#34;This is Logan and David,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The teacher,&#34; he states as he holds his hand out to shake Logans. Logan does the same and I feel like he&#39;s sizing Logan up. He then turns his attention to David and the look he gives him further solidifies my suspicions. &#34;I&#39;m guessing you picked the security details?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; David replies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to put my suitcase upstairs and then I want you to tell me about where you&#39;ve been,&#34; I say giving my uncle a small smile, knowing full well he won&#39;t tell me he&#39;ll make me guess as he can&#39;t tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can guess,&#34; he states and picks up my suitcase to walk upstairs with it. I smile and follow him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you call me?&#34; Brett asks. I shrug in response and hang up my summer dress. &#34;I would have answered,&#34; he adds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I just didn&#39;t want to bother you,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you at your mom&#39;s funeral to call me if you needed anything,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How was I supposed to bring that up to you?&#34; I ask, &#34;And what would you have actually done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You say &#39;hey my dad has gone crazy,&#39; and I would have called someone for you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who? Like grandpa? Because he has been a big help,&#34; I sarcastically state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah he still thinks Jonathon is that kid that got taken, but I would have come back,&#34; I sigh in response and look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to, I just felt ashamed, I just kept thinking he wouldn&#39;t be this way if mom was still here and she only left that night to find me,&#34; I say looking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t blame yourself over that,&#34; he pauses and stands in front of me. &#34;I&#39;ll kill him when I find him,&#34; I shake my head and look up at him. &#34;I promise you, I&#39;ll kill him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And it wasn&#39;t a good idea for him to stop taking his meds, yet he did, knowing what his alter is like,&#34; he counters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and look down and feel myself start to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m scared,&#34; I say quietly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d always been close with my uncle. He would always take me away when he got back from assignments. He stayed with us a lot whenever he was home. When my mom died he got an assignment the day after her funeral and hasn&#39;t been back since. He would call me whenever he could and when things started to get bad I tried not to answer. I just didn&#39;t want him to hear it in my voice that I wasn&#39;t ok.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; he says and hugs me. &#34;I promise I won&#39;t let anything happen to you,&#34; I nod in response and look down. &#34;When you stopped answering my calls I figured you had gotten distracted by that shit of a boyfriend,&#34; he states. I smile and pull back to dab away my tears. &#34;What had happened when you decided not to answer?&#34; he asks. I gulp and look him in the eyes to see guilt swimming in them. I look away &#34;Tell me, please,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He raped me,&#34; I quickly say, &#34;and I knew if I answered you would hear it in me that I wasn&#39;t ok,&#34; I state. He nods, a dark expression colouring his face and reaches for my arm to look at my healing cut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you start doing this?&#34; he asks and moves his fingers over old scars. I shake my head and take my hand out of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I hear Logan call and I feel relief wash over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In here,&#34; I call and move away from my uncle avoiding his gaze on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come and meet your new bodyguard,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I say and walk out after him he frowns at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he asks as we walk out of my room with my uncle not far behind and I realise that if Brett found out about Logan and me, he would kill Logan and I don&#39;t mean kick the shit out of him. He&#39;d probably dig his grave for him.</p>
