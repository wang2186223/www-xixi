                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I hear someone call and by the sound of his voice it&#39;s Carl. I lift my head and look at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In here,&#34; I say and move my legs up on the coffee table. I&#39;m sat in the more quiet areas of the mansion. It&#39;s one of my favourite rooms in the house due to the fact it&#39;s so much easier to think in here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he asks walking towards me and sitting on the couch and laying back. I shake my head and rest my head on my fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everyone in bed?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, Megan went to bed quite early, we were watching a film and she just walked out, I checked on her though and she just told me she was tired,&#34; he says and I nod. &#34;What&#39;s happened?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well they asked me to break up with Megan, well more or less ordered me to, and I have to cut jobs and I made 200 million, but that still means I have to cut jobs,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, what did you say?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said no to breaking up with Megan and I&#39;d rather de-promote people,&#34; I say and he sighs a little &#34;making 200 million wasn&#39;t too bad though,&#34; I say and he laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why aren&#39;t you happier then?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan came up again and well some of what they said did make sense, I&#39;m not supposed to have a relationship at this moment in my life due to my therapy and well I have to move back here come Christmas,&#34; I say and look down at the glass of whisky in my hand. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t be able to bring Megan and well I do feel that if I leave it longer it will hurt her more,&#34; I explain and he nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it&#39;s that time now, I&#39;m luckily stalling my time of taking over the family business very well,&#34; he explains. &#34;It&#39;s much easier when your parents don&#39;t agree with your &#39;lifestyle,&#39;&#34; he says with a small smirk. &#34;I think letting them walk in on me having sex with a dude was the best thing to ever do,&#34; he says and looks up at the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah well my parents have really screwed me over, getting themselves killed and all that,&#34; I say and he laughs. &#34;I should go up to bed,&#34; I say standing and staggering a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much have you had?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really don&#39;t know,&#34; I say and sit back down. &#34;Did Megan talk to Brendan?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I saw her come out of his bedroom,&#34; he pauses &#34;she didn&#39;t seem happy though,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think he&#39;s hiding something,&#34; I say and then there&#39;s a small knock at the door. I look and so does Carl to see Brendan stood looking at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I talk to you?&#34; he asks. I nod and he walks towards us and sits on the couch. &#34;I sort of need to tell someone I just don&#39;t know how to go about telling someone this,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;re telling us?&#34; Carl asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I can&#39;t really keep this in,&#34; he says. &#34;I just don&#39;t want you telling Megan or even anyone,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I say and reach for the bottle of whisky on the table. Carl gets up and walks towards the glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a tumour,&#34; he says &#34;in my brain, they don&#39;t know if it&#39;s cancerous and I&#39;m waiting on my results,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy cow,&#34; Carl says &#34;I did not expect that I expected you to say something like I&#39;ve got an STI or something,&#34; he adds and I smile a little and look at Brendan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if it&#39;s not cancerous?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re still going to remove it because it&#39;s causing pain that&#39;s why I haven&#39;t been very sociable,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well your best bet is to wait until you have the results, try not to think about it too much, I know that sounds easier said than done but it&#39;s really your only option otherwise you&#39;re just going to be negative about the whole think and end up making yourself ill,&#34; I explain and he nods and looks down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just telling my family especially when I&#39;m not exactly their favourite child,&#34; he pauses &#34;they&#39;re actually on the verge of disowning me or some shit,&#34; he says and I can even tell this is taking it&#39;s toll on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I tell you what, don&#39;t think about any of it at all,&#34; I say &#34;not at all while you&#39;re here, think about it when it comes to it,&#34; I say sternly and stand up. &#34;I am definitely off to bed now because if I don&#39;t I&#39;ll just keep drinking,&#34; I say downing my drink and walking towards the door. &#34;You two talk it out,&#34; I say pointing to them and walking out of the room shutting the door behind me. I walk down the hall to the staircase and then up it to the bedroom I&#39;m sharing with Megan. Taking a deep breath I slowly let it out and open the door to see the lights are off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shutting the door behind me I walk towards the bed and sit down. I turn the lamp on and then take my jacket off and then look at Megan to see her fast asleep. It&#39;s nice to see her sleeping calmly for once. I start to unbutton my shirt when I feel her start to stir. I look at her to see her turn on her side so her back is to me. I turn and take my shirt off and then my trousers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Climbing into bed I turn the lamp off and move my arms around her waist. I hold her tightly to me and kiss her shoulder and then close my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been drinking,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only had a few,&#34; I say. &#34;We went out to celebrate,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you go?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just to a bar,&#34; I say. I then feel her move in my arms so she&#39;s now sat up. I then feel her move out of my arms. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just going to sleep somewhere else,&#34; she says and I frown and sit up to turn the lamp on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I ask frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan please,&#34; she begs now looking at me while tilting her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have I done?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d rather tell you in the morning when you&#39;re sober,&#34; she says, I take her hand and pull her down to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well if it&#39;s me I&#39;ll sleep in another room,&#34; I say. She sighs and I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s frustration or defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter,&#34; she says climbing back into bed and laying down. I frown and turn the light off. I move my hands back around her waist</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out of the room, shutting the door quietly behind me and try and sneak to Yasmin&#39;s room. I open her bedroom door and then shut it and sit on her bed. I turn on her lamp and shake her a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yasmin,&#34; I say, her eyes open and she looks right at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; she asks closing her eyes and turning on her side away from the lamp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I sleep in here?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; she says and I smile and turn the light off. &#34;What&#39;s happened?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan has been drinking and well he came back got into bed and everything and put his arms around me. But he smelt of alcohol and to be honest like my dad,&#34; she&#39;s silent for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm, talk to him in the morning,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and lay facing the ceiling. I am going to tell him in the morning and maybe tell him why it affected me the way it has.</p>
