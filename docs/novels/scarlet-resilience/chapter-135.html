                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan wraps his arms around my waist and pulls me close to his body. We talked for an hour before I started to feel tired. He had wrapped a sheet around us both covering our naked bodies. I never thought I&#39;d be comfortable with my own naked body again, never mind being naked with a man. He knows how to make me feel normal. I thought I&#39;d feel ashamed of what we have done, but I don&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat spreads down my chest to my stomach then my core as I feel Logan&#39;s lips at the nape of my neck. Opening my eyes, I look at the candle burning on the nightstand next to the bed. It seems he has other things on his mind, and one of them isn&#39;t sleeping. I thought he&#39;d want to sleep, with us having to get up early for our flight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have an early flight, you know,&#34; I say as his hand moves to my breasts. His fingers tease my nipple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a private jet we can fly whenever we want,&#34; he says between kisses. I chuckle and turn to look at him. &#34;What it&#39;s true,&#34; he pauses, &#34;plus I own it, it can&#39;t go anywhere without my say so,&#34; he states, and I shake my head. He leans forward and kisses me on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers give my nipple a little squeeze. I respond by holding his lower lips between my teeth. He groans as I slowly let go and move my hand up through his hair to press him to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By that logic, we could stay in here all month,&#34; I say against his lips and feel his fingers at my sex. Moaning, I lift my leg a little, giving him better access. His fingers move through my lips, and I can&#39;t help but whimper and blush at knowing how wet I have become from just this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck I love how wet you get,&#34; he groans. I then feel his erection press against me. &#34;I need to be inside you,&#34; I nod in response and feel him move my leg over his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan enters me from behind, and I moan at the feel of him. Tilting my head back, he kisses my neck, and I feel his other hand move under me to come round and tease my breasts. He holds my leg up and thrusts into me. I move my hand up to hold onto him as I meet him thrust for thrust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sheen of sweat covers our bodies as pleasure grows more intense. The only sounds in the room are the ones coming from us, and all it does is turn me on more. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because I&#39;m more relaxed than before or maybe the position, but this feels more intense if anything hotter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulls away and looks me in the eyes. His hand moves up to my neck to make me stay looking at him. Gripping his shoulder, I try to hold back my orgasm, not wanting to come so soon, but I can&#39;t help it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh God,&#34; I moan, and I feel myself scratch his back as my orgasm rushes through me. He continues at a slower speed as I come down from my orgasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re hot as hell when you come,&#34; he states, &#34;I want to see it again,&#34; he says. I lick my lips and feel him move faster and harder. His fingers rub at my clit, and he kisses my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body shakes as another orgasm starts to build. I kiss up to his ear and then give the skin below it a little nibble. He groans in response and bites my neck in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I pant. He looks at me, and I see the lustful look in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, you feel good,&#34; he groans, and I feel my spine tingle and then wetness between my legs as I scream and come harder than I ever have with him before. His climax follows mine, and then he collapses back panting, and I do the same. &#34;Fuck me that was good,&#34; he says out of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have my eyes closed as I try to cool and calm my body down. I can still feel my legs spasming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Staying in here for the next month sounds like a decent plan,&#34; he says, and I laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah it does,&#34; I reply and feel his arm go over my waist and his lips at my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ok?&#34; he asks. I open my eyes and feel myself blush. I&#39;m not sure I want to tell him that I think I orgasmed so hard I peed. He frowns at me.&#34;Megan,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shit,&#34; he says. I look at him to see worry go clear over his face. &#34;I was too rough wasn&#39;t I,&#34; he sits up and moves away from me, &#34;I&#39;m such a fucking idiot,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I ask. &#34;No you weren&#39;t, I just&#34; I look away from him and sigh. I could not be any more embarrassed right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; he asks with worry evident on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m all wet,&#34; I say and cover my face with my hand as my whole face burns with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; he asks, and I feel him touch my leg, &#34;Oh,&#34; he says, I part my fingers to look at him a little to see a smirk on his face. &#34;You are the sexiest woman I&#39;ve ever god damn met,&#34; he states and moves my hands from my face and kisses me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ew,&#34; I say as I pull back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, it&#39;s fine,&#34; he states. &#34;Not every woman experiences it, but it&#39;s normal,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To pee?&#34; I frown at him in question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What no, you didn&#39;t pee, well no one knows what it is, the common name for it is squirting,&#34; he states to me, and I frown at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All you need to understand is that it&#39;s ok and not something to be embarrassed about,&#34; he states, moving my hair from my face. &#34;Ok?&#34; he asks, and I nod. &#34;Why don&#39;t we shower and then go to sleep?&#34; he asks. I nod. I slowly move to the end of the bed and stand; my legs shake a little. His hands rest on my hips to steady me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walk into the bathroom, and it&#39;s a big bathroom. There&#39;s a white clawfoot tub in the middle. The shower is in the corner, and it&#39;s big enough for me to lay down in it, I notice there are two shower heads, and there are different sprayers in the wall. The floor is black marble, and the walls are brilliant white. We move further in, and I see two sinks in front of a large mirror. Logan moves towards the shower and turns it on, and I raise an eyebrow as he presses a few buttons on the wall. The shower turns on, and I watch as the power increases a little. He looks at me and holds his hand out for me. I take it, and he looks at the remote and then points at a few buttons letting me know which one does what. He tells me where the towels are and then leaves me to shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting down on the bed I look down at my dick, I&#39;d just changed the sheets, and I&#39;d managed to stay limp enough to do it. How the hell am I still hard? I know why it&#39;s because my girlfriend is hot as hell. Everything about her turns me on. The fact she was nervous, her embarrassment, the noises she makes, and just her, it all turns me on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I&#39;d hurt her, I felt like jumping out of the window, but to find out she&#39;d ejaculated I nearly retook her. She looked cute as hell, all embarrassed, and I&#39;m not going to lie, it boosted my ego. It&#39;s only happened a few times with other women. I wonder if she realised she asked me to go harder. I don&#39;t think she&#39;d want it rough, but I guess I was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why won&#39;t you go down,&#34; I say to my penis. &#34;If I wanted to go all night you probably wouldn&#39;t play ball,&#34; I growl and lay back on the bed. I need to think of something else and not walk into the bathroom and share a shower with her. I sigh and stand up. Just because I want to have sex with her doesn&#39;t mean I should, I could just go in and have a shower with her. I have good will power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I know it, I&#39;m stood in the bathroom watching her shower. I walk towards her and open the glass door. She turns and looks at me as the water runs over her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; I say. She smiles and gazes down my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I press the button to turn the other showerhead on, and water runs down my body, the hot water warming me up. I need a cold shower if anything-an Ice cold one. Heck, maybe an ice bath might just do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turns so her back is to me and I can&#39;t help but watch shampoo suds run down her back to her butt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a bad idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan turns and walks towards me and moves a loofa over my body. I look down to see it covered in bubbles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was wondering when you&#39;d be joining me,&#34; she states, and I look at her to see her give me a small smile. &#34;I&#39;ve just about finished,&#34; she says as she moves the loofa down my arm and lazily over my stomach. Her other hand moves the bubbles down, and I feel her fingers move over my dick. I look down and see her hand move down to cup my balls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was debating on coming in,&#34; I state, licking my lips and moving my hands to her hips. She sinks to her knees and washes my legs with the loofa and then stands and moves in to kiss me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Turn around,&#34; she says just before her lips touch mine. I look into her eyes. &#34;Logan,&#34; she tells me. I smirk and turn around. I hear her take some more shower gel and then feel her clean my shoulders and back. Shower sex isn&#39;t always great, but I think with her any sex will be amazing. Her hands move down to my butt and then round to my front. I look down to see the loofa is gone and it&#39;s just her hands covered in bubbles. She takes my dick in her hands, massages the soap along the length while her other hand moves to my balls stroking the aroused fire within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I breathe, &#34;you already did there,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I&#39;m just making sure you&#39;re clean,&#34; she says. Her hands slide up and across my pelvis to my hips. &#34;You can turn back around now,&#34; she orders, I do as I&#39;m told, and she pulls me by my arm back under the hot spray. &#34;All done,&#34; she says as she watches the soapy bubbles move down my body. I move forward and place my hand on her bum, pulling her towards my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me thank you,&#34; I say and press her against the tiled wall. She looks up at me and moves her arms around my neck, I lift her, and her legs move around my hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing my lips to hers, I can&#39;t help but push my tongue past her lips. She moans as I move a hand to her sex, and I feel just how wet she is, and my god is she. I want nothing more than to get on my knees and worship her with my tongue, but I know I need to be inside her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dick is hard as stone as I move it in line with her core. She moans as I swirl my tip at her entrance and then with a long hard, fast thrust I&#39;m inside her again. She pulls on my hair, making the kiss break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan, again,&#34; she tells me, and I do as the water beats down on us.</p>
