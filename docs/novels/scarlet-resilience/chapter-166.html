                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Left guy pulls a chair from the side to where Jonathon is and puts a bottle of water at the side of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I have to tie you up again? Or will you sit there quietly?&#34; Darth asks me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll sit quietly,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darth leads me to the chair, and I sit down on it. He places his black-gloved hand on my shoulders as if holding me in place. I gulp down my emotions and look at Jonathon. He looks so skinny, his jeans don&#39;t fit him very well, and his ribs are on show. Darth leans down. I look to the side of me as he turns and I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s looking at me, but he&#39;s facing me, so I&#39;m guessing he is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jonathon has some things to tell you,&#34; he says, and then he moves his hand to stroke my bruised cheek. I flinch, he touches me anyway. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. We won&#39;t do to you what we&#39;ve done to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks at Jonathon, before picking up the water and holding it out in front of me. I take it and follow his gaze to Jonathon. The man that had electrocuted him unhooks the chains that are keeping him from the floor. Jonathan drops to the ground with a sickening thud. His body doesn&#39;t move, which makes the man pick him up by his hair. I watch as the other guy brings a chair and places it several feet from me. Right guy drags him to the chair and makes him sit in it before strapping his hands to the modified chair. Both Left and Right guy stand at either side of Jonathon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darth walks away from me, and I have this sense of loss leave me the further he walks away. I frown, mentally shaking my head. I think I&#39;ve got Stockholm syndrome, is that possible after being with your kidnapper for a few minutes? I just feel like I know him, but I&#39;m not sure. I don&#39;t know anyone who would do this to me, well I do, and he&#39;s sitting in front of me tied up and beaten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, remember what we spoke about?&#34; he asks Jonathon. Jonathan glares at him, Darth just tilts his head before punching Jonathon in the face. I gulp down any emotions I feel and watch as he hits him repeatedly. &#34;Now, do you remember?&#34; He steps away from Jonathon, and I see the blood drip out of his mouth. He spits the blood; I notice a tooth mixed with the blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Jonathon says. He looks at me and snarls a little before looking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell her what you told me,&#34; Darth orders. I watch as he walks back towards me, &#34;Drink, it will clear the drug out of your system,&#34; he says to me. I nod and look down at the bottled water. It looks new, the seal isn&#39;t broke, and I can&#39;t see any holes anywhere to indicate it had been tampered with. I feel around the bottle just to make sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she screwing you?&#34; Jonathon asks. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s Jonathon or Benjamin that is sitting here. But that question makes me think it&#39;s Benjamin. &#34;The whore,&#34; he spits. Left turns to look at him and goes to hit him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t,&#34; I say quickly. I&#39;m not sure why I stopped him, but I just feel that if they continue, they&#39;ll knock him out. Left stops and looks at Darth who is standing behind me. I look up at him, &#34;Please, if you knock him out he won&#39;t be able to tell me anything,&#34; I say. He sighs and looks back to Left and nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin laughs, &#34;You still love me, I see,&#34; he says. I sigh in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clean his face,&#34; Darth says. Right walks towards a big barrel and takes a sponge out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why am I here?&#34; I ask. I&#39;m not sure if I should be happy about the fact Jonathon is here and not out waiting to get me alone. It would seem he&#39;s been here for weeks. Which makes me question if he escaped or if these people took him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because Jonathon has some things to tell you,&#34; Darth states. &#34;I&#39;ll start for you, that sitting there in front of you is not Benjamin, Benjamin doesn&#39;t exist. Jonathan doesn&#39;t have DID; he is a psychopath,&#34; he states. I frown at him and then look at Jonathon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You caught me,&#34; he says, laughing. I shake my head a little as my brain tries to catch up with what my ears are hearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But,&#34; I blink and then look at the barrel of water and then back at Jonathon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, but,&#34; Jonathan mocks, with a cackle. &#34;Catch up princess, I faked everything, it was easy, really. Who would have thought the genius standing behind you would catch on?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel my heart pound in my ears as the information sinks in. I had given him so much forgiveness because I thought he was mentally ill. I thought he didn&#39;t know about any of it, that he wouldn&#39;t ever willingly do any of that stuff to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I know it I&#39;m standing up. I walk over to him and unbuckle his hands from the chair. He looks up at me; I punch him as hard as I can. He falls onto the ground. I grab him by his hair and drag him towards the barrel. The anger in me taking over. This man had tortured me for two years and thought it was perfectly fine. He tricked me and others into thinking he was a victim too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging him up, I plunge his head into the water, holding him under. He struggles, just like how I did when he did this to me all the time. I step over him and keep both of his arms behind his back. I then pull his head up. He takes a deep breath as his body sucks in the much-needed oxygen, he brings in enough just in time for me to hold him under again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should we stop her?&#34; I hear one of the three men behind me say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I hear the other reply. &#34;If she kills him, we&#39;ll burn his body,&#34; and for some reason I know that&#39;s Darth. I pull him out and repeat the process over and over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please stop,&#34; he begs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Funny you never stopped when I asked you to,&#34; I say and hold his head under to then pull him back out. &#34;You held me under until I stopped breathing,&#34; I say, and he fights me more. &#34;I should do the same,&#34; I then plunge his head back into the barrel. I watch as bubbles start to slow at coming up from the water; a sense of satisfaction fills me a little. If he&#39;s dead I don&#39;t have to live in fear anymore, I&#39;ll be free of him, free of the nightmares and may be open to love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Small bubbles come to the surface and then stop as his body stops fighting me and goes limp. I sigh as I realise killing him makes me just as evil as him. I throw him out of the barrel onto the floor. Kneeling, I start CPR on him. I guess taking first aid in class last year has come in handy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jerks up to the side, coughing water out of his lungs. He&#39;s done the same thing to me before when his games went too far, and he had to do CPR on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get up and walk away from him to the chair I was sitting on. I pick up my bottle of water and take a drink of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you save him?&#34; Darth asks me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d be as bad as him,&#34; I say and look down at my black dress to see it&#39;s drenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could never be as bad as him,&#34; he says and wipes my cheek. I hadn&#39;t realised I had been crying. I quickly wipe my cheeks and try my best to calm my emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A, lately I&#39;m not so sure,&#34; I say quietly and sit in the chair given to me. I watch as Left and Right pick Jonathan up by the arms and take him back to the chair. On the upside, he looks a little cleaner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can tell you&#39;re my daughter,&#34; Jonathan states with a chuckle. His hair drips with water as he looks at me, I can&#39;t help but be slightly proud of myself. I narrow my eyes on him as I fold my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not your daughter,&#34; I state. His eyes widen in shock. I smirk a little. &#34;You thought Brett wouldn&#39;t tell me?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He got some guts and came back then?&#34; he asks &#34;Arsehole left as soon as your whore of a mother died,&#34; he states. &#34;By the look of you, the apple doesn&#39;t fall too far now does it?&#34; he mocks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You killed her because she cheated on you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, that wasn&#39;t the reason, and I wouldn&#39;t say I killed her, I wasn&#39;t the one who drove into her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You made her run a red light,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, she didn&#39;t run the red light, I crashed into the back of her as she stopped at the red light and forced her car into the middle of the intersection,&#34; he says as if it was a normal thing to say. &#34;Bitch shouldn&#39;t have tried to leave me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re sick,&#34; I say in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, she is, I did everything for that woman, and she decided to run off with my brother, I knew she was fucking him, I wasn&#39;t bothered about that as long as it was my bed she got into every night. She was mine,&#34; he snaps. &#34;And I figured if I couldn&#39;t have her, no one could, luckily for me I had you as her replacement,&#34; he says again with the carefree attitude. Like it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to be this way. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean for her to die,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you expect?&#34; I ask as I feel myself get angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was meaning to drag her back home and punish her for trying to leave me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel like punishing you right now,&#34; I mutter and he grins. I feel a hand on my shoulder, Jonathan&#39;s eyes narrow, and I see the anger evident in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, we can do that,&#34; Darth says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I can do that,&#34; I say, standing up. Right, and Left both look towards each other. They probably think I&#39;m going to go crazy on him again. I&#39;m not; I&#39;m just going to do something I&#39;ve wanted to do since he first touched me.</p>
