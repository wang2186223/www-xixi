                <p>&#34;Mr Peters,&#34; she says, breaking the silence as she looks through her purse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan please,&#34; he says and his voice doesn&#39;t seem nervous. She looks at him and smiles a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going down to the restaurant?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes we&#39;re going to get brunch,&#34; he says casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look towards the numbers above the door and watch as the light moves down the floors. I cannot be in here any longer, I can feel myself panicking. Logan is going to lose everything because of me, because of my selfish actions, I should not be with him. I should be with someone who is my age and not someone like Logan. Him being with me will ruin his life. I wrap my arms around myself as I feel my thoughts become even more negative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I hear Logan say and I have a feeling he&#39;s said my name more than once. I look at him and he gives me a small smile. I look towards the doors to see them open. His hand moves the small of my back and he ushers me out. &#34;Calm down,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should leave,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll sort this ok,&#34; he says and I look at him as we walk towards the restaurant</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But,&#34; I say and he cuts me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going to be having brunch with them, she offered as she wants to talk,&#34; he explains &#34;just calm down and we&#39;ll get through this ok,&#34; he says and I walk with him into the restaurant. We walk up to the que and Logan leans to the maitre d&#39; and tells him that the couple in front of us are with us. The maitre d&#39; nods and leads all four of us to a booth table making us jump the queue of waiting customers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve been waiting for you sir, is this table good enough?&#34; he asks Logan. Logan nods and sits down. I sit next to him, the booth is rounded. I watch as my headteacher and her husband slide in at the opposite side. &#34;Is there any drink I can get sent for you?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A water for me please,&#34; Logan says and then the maitre d&#39; looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same please,&#34;I say and he turns his attention to my headmistress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually,&#34; Logan says before they can answer them. &#34;I&#39;ll also have a whisky,&#34; he says and the maitre d&#39; raises an eyebrow &#34;long day ahead,&#34; he states and the maitre d&#39; smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away sir,&#34; he says and turns back to my head teacher to get their drink order. I lean over to Logan and whisper in his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not even 1pm yet,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe not but I need something to calm my nerves,&#34; he says and I frown while looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could have got me one too,&#34; I say and he laughs and moves an arm around me and gets comfy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How come you are treated as a priority here?&#34; My headmaster asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My company owns this place,&#34; he says and she raises an eyebrow &#34;so shall we talk about what you just saw?&#34; he asks as a female waiter walks over with our drinks. She places them down and as she places Logans down he takes it and downs it.&#34;Another one please,&#34; he says and she nods and takes his empty glass away.&#34;I feel much better now,&#34; he says and I sigh and look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did I see?&#34; she asks. He sighs and looks towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can quit if you want or if you want buy your silence,&#34; he says and I look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan will you be serious, you&#39;re as bad as Carl,&#34; I snap at him and look away from him. &#34;It&#39;s obvious what you saw, just tell us what you&#39;re going to do about it,&#34; I say and look down, &#34;if you want us to break up we will so just tell us,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will we?&#34; Logan asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I snap at him and he just looks down with a frown and the waitress returns with Logan&#39;s second drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want you to break up,&#34; she says and I look up at her &#34;he was my headmaster,&#34; she says pointing to her husband and he just smiles and looks through the menu. &#34;Professionally I should report what I&#39;ve seen but then I&#39;d probably be destroying something that could last, luckily we never got caught and well what you do in your spare time has nothing to do with me,&#34; she explains and I just look at her dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious?&#34; Logan asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very, we will discuss this more when we return to school but for now I would like to enjoy my anniversary,&#34; she says looking at her husband who clearly was older than her. &#34;I think you should probably be a bit more careful, I had an idea that you both had gotten together you&#39;ll both be fine as long as I don&#39;t get anyone telling me &#39;I&#39;ve seen Mr Peters and Megan doing it in his office,&#39; because then I have to do something,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We haven&#39;t had sex,&#34; Logan says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah he&#39;s the frigid one,&#34; I say and her husband laughs and Logan looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s one way to break the ice,&#34; she says with a laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we order food now?&#34; her husband asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Logan says and looks through the menu.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This whole meal has gone quite well, there was no awkward silences once the food came. My headmistress had told us how she met her husband and how they had hidden their relationship within a boarding school. She had also told us that the trip to paris was a surprise from her husband for their anniversary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan seemed to have relaxed instantly after having some food. He even ordered some champagne, his excuse being because he can afford it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir,&#34; I hear David say. Logan looks at him &#34;I&#39;m sorry to interrupt but we really should be setting off,&#34; he says. Logan sighs and looks at his watch. &#34;I&#39;m sorry sir,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not your fault, I have to go back to work at some point,&#34; Logan sighs and takes his wallet out to pay for the meal. He turns to the headmistress &#34;Have a wonderful anniversary, I&#39;ve had David here set up a tab for you so you don&#39;t have to spend any more money in this hotel, it&#39;s all on me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to do that,&#34; she says to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I don&#39;t my money will just be sat in my account doing nothing it seems a waste,&#34; he says and I stand and smile at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Show off,&#34; I say and finish off my glass of champagne. He smiles and moves his arm around my waist. &#34;Cya soon,&#34; I say to them with a small smile and a wave. &#34;Enjoy your anniversary,&#34; I say and they nod with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are your shoes from they are gorgeous?&#34; My headmistress asks and I look down to my shoes as she&#39;s looking down at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan got them I think they&#39;re from Christian Louboutin,&#34; I say and look at him and he nods. &#34;He went and bought them while I was in Gucci,&#34; I say and she smiles a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t you buy me designer stuff?&#34; she asks her husband and he rolls his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I didn&#39;t just buy you a mulberry bag,&#34; he says and I smile and look at Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only got her them because I love her in heels,&#34; he says and I punch his arm. &#34;It&#39;s true, they were for my own satisfaction only,&#34; he says and looks at them. &#34;I get more satisfaction when she walks in front of me,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up,&#34; I snap and they laugh. &#34;Look David is waiting for us,&#34; I say and he sighs pushes me forward a little to make me walk and I do. I look behind me to see him looking at me, he smiles and says something to them. &#34;Logan,&#34; I say stopping. I watch him sigh and walks over to me. He puts his hand in mine and we walk out of the restaurant together to see David stood waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have already packed your things together sir,&#34; he says and Logan nods and follows him out of the hotel. As we leave we&#39;re told by the hotel staff that it was a happy opportunity to see us and that they wish to see us again.</p>
