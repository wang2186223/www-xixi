                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour into the lesson a guy walks in holding a box of roses and starts to hand them out. I watch as the ones expecting roses are happy to get one and the ones not expecting who do get one seem surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy walks towards me and Melanie and gives Melanie two and then places two on my desk and then stops and places another. I frown a little and look at them. One from Melanie, one from Tyler and one saying from &#39;B&#39;, I look at Melanie and she smiles at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s from Brendan,&#34; she says. I smile a little and smell all three. &#34;And Megan you&#39;re the coolest best friend ever too,&#34; she says. I smile and watch as the guy laughs at the amount and he sighs while looking at them &#34;it seems Courtney has sent him one,&#34; Melanie says. I look to see a grinning Courtney.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems you&#39;re Mr Popular,&#34; the guy said and walked out of the room. Logan looks at them, his eyes meeting who he thinks sent him one if the person is in the class. He then stops as he looks at one and smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seen one you like Sir?&#34; Courtney asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, a thought just came into my head that is all,&#34; he said and placed the roses in a pile to the side &#34;yours however was a bit crude for my taste,&#34; he said and the class cracked out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know...&#34; she trails off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The big curly C gave you away,&#34; he said &#34;also you are lucky I am lenient because any other teacher would have sent you to the principal&#39;s office and maybe have you taken out of their class for being obsessed,&#34; he said and her jaw drops open. &#34;To be honest I dislike valentine&#39;s day,&#34; he said &#34;if you love someone you should show it everyday not just one day a year or something , it&#39;s too commercialised now,&#34; he said and then there&#39;s a knock at the door and then it opens. A guy wearing a UPS jumpsuit and hat walks in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a parcel for a Megan Wright,&#34; he says. I frown and slowly put my hand up. He smiles and walks out and then comes back in carrying a big black box. I get up and meet him half way. &#34;Sign here for me please,&#34; he said once putting It down and picking up the clip board that was on top of it. I take his pen and sign for it. &#34;And here,&#34; he points to the bottom; I sign &#34;thanks,&#34; he said and walks out of the room. I frown and look around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What am I suppose to do with this?&#34; I ask. Logan shrugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Opening it would be a start,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I don&#39;t even know what it is, it could be a bomb or something,&#34; I say. He laughs and so does everyone else. &#34;I&#39;m serious you get people who send random bombs to people,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just open it,&#34; Melanie says. I sigh and pull at the tape at the top pulling it off and then pulling the tape that followed it down. I pull one of the flaps down and there in front of me are roses. I frown again and take a piece of paper that&#39;s inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#39;To Megan told you there was more&#39;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw drop open and I&#39;m sure it hit the floor. I look at what&#39;s inside to see rose&#39;s big roses and a few with small diamonds inside. I smile a little and I feel my eyes start to water. It is true I&#39;m a sucker for romantic stuff like this and I did cry at things like this. I still cry at titanic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m never going to be able to carry these all day,&#34; I said out loud and I want nothing more than to jump on Logan and just kiss him and never stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s inside?&#34; he asks and pulls the rest of the black card away and takes the roses out and the girls all coo. I cover my eyes and take a deep breath to stop myself from crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is so sweet who are they from?&#34; A girl asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; I stutter out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s just creepy,&#34; Courtney says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to break the rest of your face?&#34; Melanie asks her and I laugh. Logan passes them to me and I look at the card that&#39;s clipped to the wrapping. &#34;What does that say?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing just that there&#39;s a hundred roses sprinkled with diamante pins,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well someone obviously feels very sorry for you,&#34; Courtney says. I sigh and look at Logan and he looks like he wants to punch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be such a jealous bitch,&#34; I snap &#34;jeez if anyone got you something like this it would only be from someone who wanted to desperately get laid,&#34; I growl. Her jaw drops open &#34;and I suggest you don&#39;t said anything else because you will end up with your face broken,&#34; I said and walk off to my desk. &#34;I don&#39;t really care why someone bought me it, I&#39;m just happy that they think enough about me to buy me something this beautiful,&#34; I said sitting in my seat and placing them on my desk in front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wait until everyone has left the room and walk to Logan who is stood in front of his desk. I smile at him and place the flowers on his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could kiss you right now and never stop,&#34; I said &#34;they must have cost you hundreds,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Completely worth the money to see that smile on your face,&#34; he says. I smile again and look towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll see you in an hour?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I&#39;ll take you to your session and drop these off at home for you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said and bite my bottom lips</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like your card by the way,&#34; he said &#34;and the rose,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well...&#34; I said and move closer and as I do the door opens. I step back and the head is stood there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aww they are beautiful I love roses,&#34; she coo&#39;s. I frown &#34;I wish my husband would do something romantic like that for me but all I get is a flipping card,&#34; she says. She then looks at me &#34;how come you&#39;re not in class?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm I was just seeing if Logan was taking me to my session after science and to see if he&#39;d drop these off home for me,&#34; I explain to her, which was not a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I bet you were nearly in tears I&#39;d be blubbering like a whale.&#34; She says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said and scratch the back of my head and look at Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She did nearly cry, she thought it was a bomb at first,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I can imagine no one expects something like these,&#34; she said touching one of the roses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be going to class,&#34; I said and walk off &#34;Cya,&#34; I said giving Logan a wave. He smiles and looks at the head. I smile and pretty much skip to my next lesson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His blue eyes scanned me as I lean against his car. We were parked outside my psychologist&#39;s house. He moves his arms around me and pulls me close. I smile a little and look down at my feet. He strokes my arm and moves his hand up to my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;ll be ok,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know I just don&#39;t like talking about everything,&#34; I said and move my hand to his stubbly face. He now had the right amount of stubble I like. &#34;Give me a kiss and get yourself off,&#34; I said smiling. He smiles and leans in to give me a kiss. He pulls back and I pout a little and look up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was expecting a bit more than a peck,&#34; I say, he laughs and pulls away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on get in there,&#34; he said &#34;I&#39;m doing something special for you tonight so look forward to that ok,&#34; he said as he walked round to the driver&#39;s seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget to look after my flowers,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will with my life,&#34; he says. I smile and walk towards the house, I turn and give him a small wave and walk inside.</p>
