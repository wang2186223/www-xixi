                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My whole body feels heavy, like it&#39;s being weighed down by something. Beeping slowly comes into earshot and my eyelids slowly open. I can&#39;t seem to open them quickly, it&#39;s like they&#39;re taped down. Finally I get my eyes open and I&#39;m blinded by a bright light. The bright light moves away and then is back again. I move my hand to my face and slowly try to get up.The bed starts to move and I&#39;m put in a sat up position. I open my eyes and it&#39;s much easier than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where,&#34; I start to say and I feel how dry my mouth is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re in hospital,&#34; I hear David say. I turn to look in the direction his voice came from to see him sat in the chair at the side of my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; I ask and it comes out hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You overdosed,&#34; he says and I frown and look down at my hands to see an IV in both, one leading to a bag of fluid and the other leading to small bag of clear fluid. I look at him and sigh. &#34;Heroin?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; he states and I move my hand through my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s Megan is she ok?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl called me earlier and told me she managed to sleep through the night so I&#39;m guessing she&#39;s ok,&#34; he says and I nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I pause &#34;I want to get out of here,&#34; I say sitting fully up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet, they need to check your heart,&#34; he says and I look down at my chest to see tags on it. &#34;Why go back on that stuff?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know it was just something that happened, I&#39;m not exactly back on the drug,&#34; I say to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good I guess, just don&#39;t do it again, you passed out right in front of Megan and I know she didn&#39;t believe my lie,&#34; he says and stands up. &#34;Do you want me to get rid of your uncle so you and her can be together?&#34; he asks. I chuckle slightly and lay my head back and close my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If only it was that easy, he does have a family,&#34; I explain and he smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can make it look like an accident or suicide,&#34; he says and I turn my head to look at him to see the smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t tempt me,&#34; I say and he stands up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I&#39;m going to go get the nurse so you can be discharged soon,&#34;</p>

                <p>It took a while to be discharged, apparently my heart was beating too fast so I had to wait a little while longer to leave. David received a call from Carl not long ago to give him an update about what&#39;s going on at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t be with her now,&#34; I say to David. He looks at me and then reaches over and slaps the back of my head. &#34;That&#39;s for being stupid,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is no need,&#34; I scowl and rubbing the back of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you&#39;re being an idiot Logan, what makes you think you can&#39;t be with her now?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because everything has gone to shit, she doesn&#39;t want to see me and after last night I&#39;d be a fool to think she&#39;d want me,&#34; I say tilting my head back and closing my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First of all, you have to realise that you both have demons, she knows you&#39;ve got demons and she is willing to be with you regardless,&#34; he says as he turns into a drive thru.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t deserve her,&#34; I say moving my chair back as the car comes to a stop. I lean the chair back and put my feet up on the dashboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh get out of your pity party, you&#39;re the one that turned back to the drug, you&#39;re the one that made the decision to break up with her, you have all the resources to get rid of your uncle for good yet you have not used them,&#34; he explains and drives up to the part to make an order. &#34;What drink do you want?&#34; he asks me as he turns away from the speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Coffee, large, with loads of sugar,&#34; I say and he repeats what I said. He thanks the guy on the other side of the speaker and moves the car along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what is stopping you from having her here with you when you take over the company fully?&#34; he pauses &#34;And if she doesn&#39;t want to move, you can move the company over there,&#34; he pauses and turns to collect our food and pay. He drops the bag in my lap and places my coffee in my cup holder. He then pulls the car out of the drive thru and back onto the main road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;ll take ages to move the company over there,&#34; I say. &#34;I&#39;d have to be over here first,&#34; I explain</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it&#39;s a possibility,&#34; he says holding up his index finger. He stops at a traffic light and I open up the paper bag of food to see he had got me one of the new big burgers. I sit up fully and start to eat the fries. &#34;To say you&#39;re a genius you don&#39;t half lack common sense,&#34; he says and prods the side of my head with his finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, ok I&#39;m a dumb ass,&#34; I say wafting his hand away from me and biting into my burger. &#34;But she won&#39;t take me back not now,&#34; I say looking down at my burger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell her the truth,&#34; he says and I look at him frowning. &#34;I know a weird concept, but just tell her what your uncle has done, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll understand,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No she won&#39;t, she&#39;ll think there&#39;s something wrong with her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She already thinks there&#39;s something wrong with herself,&#34; he points out. I frown at him more as to how he would know that. &#34;No one tries to take their own life because they are ok with themselves,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t remind me,&#34; I mutter and take another bite of my burger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you love her you&#39;ll tell her the truth and fight for her,&#34; he says. I sigh knowing he&#39;s right. He&#39;s always right. &#34;And if that doesn&#39;t work I&#39;ll kill your uncle easy as pie,&#34; he says causing me to smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock sounds on my door and again I ignore it. All day someone has been coming to check on me and each time I&#39;m telling them I&#39;m ok. I don&#39;t allow them in, they just walk in once I don&#39;t answer. I don&#39;t want to talk about how I&#39;m feeling or what happened last night. I just want them to leave alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s me,&#34; I hear Yasmin say as she walks into my room. I don&#39;t look at her I just wipe the silent tear that has escaped my eye. I&#39;m laid in bed with the covers up to my neck. &#34;Logan is back from the hospital,&#34; she says quietly and sits on my bed. &#34;He wants to see you,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to see him,&#34; I say and clear my throat as I sit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should come out of this room,&#34; she says looking around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you coming back home with me?&#34; I ask her. She nods and gives me a small smile. &#34;They&#39;re trying to get us flights,&#34; she says and I nod and look down at my lap. &#34;Did you speak to Catherine?&#34; she asks me. I nod and she looks at me expectantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She said I have to have an assessment when I get back,&#34; I answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, she didn&#39;t say,&#34; I shrug and she looks down and takes my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you take a bath? You&#39;ll feel a bit better after,&#34; she suggests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure? I mean it does seem like I&#39;m on suicide watch right now,&#34; I say sarcastically and she smiles a little in amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure,&#34; she says and I look at our held hands remembering last night that her hands were covered in my blood. I notice that there were some dark red marks under her nails. I move my thumb across them and she looks and hides her nails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I say moving my hands through my hair and she just takes a deep breath ready to tell me not to be but I talk before she can start. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t have found me, I shouldn&#39;t have been so selfish, I just didn&#39;t know what else to do everything is going wrong and I just couldn&#39;t help myself, cutting is the only thing I can control,&#34; I explain and she just gives me a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad I found you,&#34; she says and stands up. &#34;Just don&#39;t do it again, I can&#39;t lose my best friend, do you understand?&#34; she asks and I nod. &#34;Good now I&#39;ll go run you the best bath you&#39;ve ever had,&#34; she says and walks off into the bathroom.</p>
