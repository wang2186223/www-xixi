                <p>Carl looked at me as I drove to where I knew he would be. He had that concerned look on his face as if he thought I&#39;d go too far but I wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;m not one to keep empty threats and I was going to show Brendan just that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl I won&#39;t kill the boy,&#34; I said as I pulled up at the house I knew he&#39;d be at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but you like beating people up so you may take it too far and...kill him without meaning to,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And your point being?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I know it won&#39;t be a big loss to the world but Megan...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan doesn&#39;t need him,&#34; I said and got out of the car. He sighs and gets out too. I walk to the front door and knock on it. The door opened and stood there was Aiden, he frowned and then gave me a small smile. &#34;Is</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendan here?&#34; I ask. He nods and I walk into the house to the living room to see Brendan sat with a beer in his hand. &#34;Morning,&#34; I said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened and he stood, &#34;I never touched her I swear,&#34; he said, backing away from me. &#34;I did nothing but tell her she needs you I swear,&#34; he said as I walked towards him and Carl stood behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dude, I told you he&#39;d find you here,&#34; Aiden said walking in and walking to his pack of cigarettes on the table &#34;I&#39;m not helping you either before you ask I&#39;m not getting the shit kicked out of me,&#34; he says. &#34;Oh and by the way do it outside this is a new couch I don&#39;t want blood on it,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on,&#34; I said walking towards Brendan and he ran into the kitchen and as he went to open the back door I grabbed him by his t-shirt and opened the door for him and threw him out. &#34;I don&#39;t feel like running,&#34; I said &#34;Now which do you like best, your arms or legs?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t touch her,&#34; he said standing up. I sigh and punch him in the gut causing him to collapse to the ground &#34;Ok,&#34; he said &#34;but it was all her,&#34; he adds. I sigh again, grab him by his hair and knee him in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really shouldn&#39;t lie to me,&#34; I state and look at Carl to see him standing watching with Aiden &#34;should he?&#34; I ask them. They shake their heads and I kneel down to Brendan &#34;Now tell the truth so I can get this over with,&#34; I order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was her and I swear I never had sex with her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t say you did,&#34; I said and stood and reached for his arm. &#34;I&#39;m guessing this arm,&#34; I said, holding it up and twisting. He turned his body but I stopped him by placing my foot on his shoulder. &#34;Now I can guess you have roughly a minute before I snap this arm of yours,&#34; I state and twist more. He groans in pain and I can hear Aiden wincing at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, ok I could have said no and I didn&#39;t I&#39;m sorry,&#34; Brendan said loudly in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry but it&#39;s too late I had warned you what would happen if you did not listen and well I&#39;m not known for empty threats,&#34; I state &#34;And if I let you go without carrying my threat through my reputation could change,&#34; I explain to him and twist his arm harder and then kick his arm. He screamed in pain and I dropped his arm to the floor and as it hit he groaned again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch I heard that snap,&#34; Carl said quietly and I knelt down to Brendan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take you to the hospital if you like,&#34; I said &#34;Do you want me to?&#34; I ask. He nods and I smirk a little bit &#34;don&#39;t worry it&#39;s fixable,&#34; I say. I hear Adrian laugh and I look at him and smile then look back down at Brendan</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now do you understand to listen to me?&#34; I ask. He nodded and I smiled &#34;good,&#34; I said, hitting his hand and then helping him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>---At the Hospital---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god what happened,&#34; Susan said as she walked into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was walking Max at the park and well it seemed he had tried to do some ridiculous stunt and broke his arm,&#34; I said and give her a sympathetic look &#34;you know what boys are like,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not 10 Logan,&#34; she snapped and looked at his arm that was now in a black pot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;ll be going,&#34; I said and walked towards the door &#34;I&#39;ll see you around Brendan,&#34; I said and walked out of the room and out of the hospital to my car to see Carl standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could have let me have a turn you know,&#34; he states angrily and gets back into the car. I sigh and get in the car too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry next time he fucks up he&#39;s all yours,&#34; I said and start the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body shot up when I felt someone shake me. I look to see Melanie staring at me. She had stayed over all weekend with Julie, Yasmin stayed the other night but her parents were strict on school nights. I look at a very worried Melanie and I look around my bedroom and then at the clock on the bedside table. 3:37am it read. I sigh and frown looking at the very worried Melanie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I ask &#34;have you seen a spider or something?&#34; I ask laying back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No it&#39;s Megan, she&#39;s having a nightmare and well you said not to wake her if she does have one but she&#39;s crying and sweating and screaming and...&#34; she trailed off to take a breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said and climbed out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes water but I know if I cry he&#39;ll hurt me more. With the look on his face I know exactly what he is going to do. He backed me up against the wall running his hands down my body. I gulp and scream at myself to scream, spit, kick, bite, punch, slap, do anything just to stop him from hurting me again. My body doesn&#39;t move though, it just stays stock still. It&#39;s funny how I never thought this day would come after he had felt me up several times over the past year. I have never felt so stupid in my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megs,&#34; he said and I opened my eyes and looked around to see we were no longer in the hallway but in my room and I was laid on my bed. I frown and then my eyes meet his as he pins me to my bed. I watch him lean in to kiss me. I move my head so he gets my cheek but either way I don&#39;t want him touching any part of my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t,&#34; I cry &#34;please dad,&#34; I say. He pulls back and looks at me; I gulp and look him in the eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not crying are you Megs?&#34; he asks. He smiles &#34;I&#39;ll make those tears go away,&#34; he said and leans in. I push him but he doesn&#39;t allow me to leave his grip. &#34;You&#39;ll like this,&#34; he said in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I won&#39;t, please, don&#39;t,&#34; I beg. He doesn&#39;t listen, he just pulls back and stares at me. I look him in the eyes and for the first time in a while I see something, something I haven&#39;t seen from him before. He almost looks like he cares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you,&#34; he said and I almost believe him with that look he&#39;s giving me &#34;I just want to show you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t how,&#34; I said quietly, trying my best to keep calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is,&#34; he hisses as he gets angry at me and he starts to pull at my top. I fight him knowing it&#39;s no use after the other night my body was already in pain. The smartest thing for me to do was probably just let him, but I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>can&#39;t. I have to resist because I know that if I let him I&#39;ll never forgive myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking into her room I sit on her bed watching her turn restlessly, sweat beading on her forehead and tears flowing slowly out of her closed eyelids. I sigh and move my hand through my hair. Waking her up didn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>seem appealing right now, not when I know what she&#39;s going to be like as soon as I do. I move her hair off her face and just as I do that her body shoots up. She smacks my hand away from her and gets out of her bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I said quietly but she didn&#39;t answer. She walks straight into her bathroom and slams the door shut, I sigh and get comfy on her bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you going to do something?&#34; Melanie asks me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing I can really do except stay here until she comes out of there,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what if she hurts herself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie just go to bed please,&#34; I said, moving my hand over my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would but your laying in the bed I was sleeping in,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go sleep in my bed, you too Julie,&#34; I said and I heard a little giggle come from behind the door. &#34;Please make sure she doesn&#39;t start sniffing my clothes,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will do,&#34; Melanie said and walks out of Megan&#39;s bedroom shutting the door behind her and I hear the shower turn on. I sigh and turn on my stomach and close my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about half an hour the shower turns off and I slowly open my eyes as she walks out in a towel. I sit up and look at her while yawning. &#34;Come here,&#34; I said and she slowly made her way to me. She sits on my lap and moves her arms around my neck. I touch her legs and she flinches away from my touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t,&#34; she said &#34;just don&#39;t please,&#34; and I look at her to see her crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, tell me about the nightmare,&#34; I say. She shakes her head and stands up &#34;Please, so I can help,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she said walking into her wardrobe, shutting the door she returns in a baggy jumper and jogging bottoms. She walks over to me and climbs into her bed and rests her head on her pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t you just leave it? Why do you insist on making me talk about it? I don&#39;t want to talk about it, I want to forget it,&#34; she snaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said and climbed in next to her facing her and taking her hands in mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just keep me safe,&#34; she said, moving closer to me and burying her head in my chest. I kiss the top of her head and move my arms around her shoulders holding her tightly to me.</p>
