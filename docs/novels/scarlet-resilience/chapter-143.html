                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get in the car and watch Logan walk around to get in next to me. He climbs in and starts the car, he is honestly one of the sweetest men I&#39;ve ever met. He can come across as quite scary but to me, he&#39;s always been sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know we said we weren&#39;t going to be back until around 8,&#34; I say as I look at the clock and 19:10 blinks at me, he looks at me as he pulls the car out of the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you proposing we do?&#34; he asks, and I smile a little. He shakes his head as he heads towards home, &#34;What have I turned you into?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I&#39;m just suggesting is we go get frozen yoghurt or something,&#34; I say, and he laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Frozen yoghurt it is then,&#34; he says, and I raise an eyebrow at him. I take his hand in mine and place it on my lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Two weeks later.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bringing my first back, I punch David&#39;s covered hand and follow it up with a high kick. Two weeks ago, the day after my session with Logan, I had asked David to train me to defend myself, he told me he doesn&#39;t really teach that but he can train me how to fight. I took him up on that offer. It&#39;s virtually the same when I think about it. Since then he&#39;s pulled me into the gym every day. He said I was a quick learner and it helped that I have a gymnastic background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan didn&#39;t seem too happy that I took his gym partner or that I had asked David to teach me rather than him, but the last thing I need is more sexual tension between us when we can&#39;t do anything about it. He found a partner in my uncle and Carl. Lorraine seems to scold David every time I come back to the dining table with a part of my body hurting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I told my therapist about this she seemed quite pleased by it. She said it would help me a lot and I&#39;m not going to disagree. It&#39;s helped with my pent up anger. I think more than anything, that and my sexual frustration. I think Logan has kissed me probably twice in the past two and a half weeks. It&#39;s also helping me sleep, mostly because I&#39;m too tired to dream. That&#39;s one of the main reasons I prefer for us to train at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David catches my foot, I turn, reach to the floor and lift my other leg to kick him with my other foot in the stomach. He lets go of my leg and stumbles back a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re quicker than Logan,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s because he&#39;s a giant,&#34; I state and then get onto my feet. I pull at the gloves and take them off to then walk to my water bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said you&#39;re going shopping today,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, Julie is dragging us all to some party, I don&#39;t want to go,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then don&#39;t go,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But then they accuse me of selling them out for my boyfriend, if only they knew,&#34; I say, and sit on the mat. &#34;I&#39;ll probably only go for an hour, parties have never really been my thing,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your uncle is going out tonight too,&#34; he says, and my jaw drops. He laughs and takes a sip of his drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Typical,&#34; I say, and frown at the mat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A movie night would do me but I can&#39;t even get that,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this what girlfriends are for? Conversations like this?&#34; he asks, and I laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re funny David,&#34; I say standing up and walking to the treadmill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lorraine says the same thing and I still don&#39;t get what I&#39;ve said funny half the time,&#34; he says scratching his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you two meet?&#34; I ask as I set the treadmill up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;University, I had accidentally pranked her, I meant to prank one of her male housemates and it got her instead, she wasn&#39;t too happy, cussed me out in front of all my friends and I&#39;ve been in love with her ever since,&#34; he explains with a small smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s sweet,&#34; I say as I start to jog. &#34;Not you pranking her,&#34; I say, and he smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We play pranks on each other all the time though now,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I once went on a stag do when I was younger and she stitched in all my clothes, &#39;I love my wife 4 ever and always,&#39; she thought it was hilarious,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Staking her claim,&#34; I state and watch as he ups the speed on the treadmill settings. I glare at him and he smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yep, enough talking, 10 minutes at that pace then cool down and we&#39;re done,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;!0 minutes,&#34; I say shocked knowing I can hardly do 5.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Imagine being chased for 10 minutes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean I think I&#39;ll let them catch me,&#34; I say, and he shakes his head with a roll of his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**A week or so later**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl I don&#39;t get to spend time with him at all,&#34; I complain as I try to convince him to help me with getting some alone time with Logan. &#34;I&#39;ll start coming to your lesson,&#34; I state and he stops what he&#39;s doing and frowns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re supposed to be in my lesson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah with Melanie, but they took it off my list of lessons,&#34; I pause &#34;I only took Music because I liked it,&#34; I say, and he nods while picking up music sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you play the piano for me now,&#34; he states, and I look at the baby grand piano. &#34;I&#39;ve seen you play and Melanie said in class earlier that you used to play here all the time.,&#34; I silently curse Melanie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I play at home for you instead?&#34; I ask. He shakes his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Play something for me now and I&#39;ll see what I can do about getting you and Logan some alone time,&#34; he states. I sigh and sit on the soft bench. &#34;Sing too,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I say, and he just looks at me. &#34;Fine,&#34; luckily for me, the school had ended ten minutes ago so the chances of anyone hearing me are slim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at the door to see it&#39;s open and my bodyguard is stood at the door. She&#39;s nice, a little small, but I&#39;m not going to judge a book by its cover here. She&#39;s too stealthy, all I know about her is that her name is Sandra and I&#39;m not even sure that&#39;s her real name. She looks at me and gives me a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise not to laugh?&#34; I ask her and she just smiles and gives me a small nod. I turn back around and place my hands on the piano. &#34;1 song,&#34; I say to Carl. He smiles and leans against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll even grade you,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Funny,&#34; I stretch my fingers and look down at the keys. I haven&#39;t played in so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to give you a song?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;ve got one,&#34; I state and decide on playing &#39;Beautiful Disaster&#39; by Kelly Clarkson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks at me as I start and I glare at him with a small smile. It would be a lie to say I hate this right now. I close my eyes as I sing it. This song reminds me so much of Logan, it just fits him to a tee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I finish I look at him and he smiles, &#34;You enjoyed that,&#34; he states. I shrug and look down at the keys. &#34;Play another?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more,&#34; I say, and start to play &#39;Million Reasons&#39; by Lady Gaga. He raises his eyebrows at me as I reach the high notes.</p>
