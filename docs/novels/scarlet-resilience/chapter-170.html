                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up,&#34; I say, answering my phone. Megan hasn&#39;t rung me in a while. I was surprised she answered the phone earlier, especially to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Logan,&#34; it&#39;s not Megan. It&#39;s her psychologist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything ok?&#34; I ask a little worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes and no, I was hoping you&#39;d be able to come to pick Megan up, I don&#39;t think she&#39;s in the correct mind frame to drive,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I wipe my hair with the towel. I&#39;d only just got out of the shower. &#34;Is she ok?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t discuss much over the phone, but, physically she is ok, mentally I&#39;m not so sure,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I can pick her up, I just got out of the shower so give me about 15 minutes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, good, and Logan,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s fragile right now, so when you get here, don&#39;t push her,&#34; she warns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I&#39;ll see you soon,&#34; I hang up. I dry myself and then get dressed in gym shorts and a t-shirt. Max looks up at me with his tail wagging excitedly. &#34;We&#39;re not going for a walk,&#34; I state and that just makes him more excited, he jumps up at me with his tongue hanging out. I sigh. &#34;Fine, you can come,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking downstairs, I see Carl coming out of the living room. He frowns at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For a drive,&#34; I answer and pick up my car keys. &#34;Where&#39;s David?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kitchen,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk towards the kitchen, and Max is sticking to me like glue. I don&#39;t know why he wants to go out again. We only got back from a run 15 minutes ago. After talking to Megan, I decided to take him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;David,&#34; I call as I walk into the kitchen. He turns on his stool. &#34;Can you come with me for a drive?&#34; I ask. &#34;Please?&#34; I told Megan I wouldn&#39;t tell anyone she was at her session; I intend to keep my word for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; he says frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you really going for a drive or are you going to drop peanut butter on Jonathon&#39;s nuts and let Max at him?&#34; Carl asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say it louder I don&#39;t think Brett heard you,&#34; I snap. &#34;And no,&#34; although that&#39;s a good idea, Max is trained to attack when told so minus peanut butter. &#34;Please David?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; David says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, I had to tell David what we were doing, he doesn&#39;t usually ask questions, but when it comes to Megan, he seems to be more inquisitive. If I&#39;m honest, I&#39;m a little worried. Since we broke up, she&#39;s just been so different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saturday I didn&#39;t see her, she had locked herself in her room all day. I know Lorraine checked on her, but that doesn&#39;t make me feel any better. I wondered if everything she found out had done more damage than good, and if that&#39;s the case, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d forgive myself. Would she have been better off not knowing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am standing in the waiting room; the receptionist already told Sara I arrived. The door to Sara&#39;s office opens; she walks down the hall and gives me a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she ok?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, she&#39;s calmed down a little now,&#34; she says and motions for me to follow her to her office. &#34;She&#39;s a little teary but ok,&#34; She opens her office door, and I walk in to see Megan sat on the couch. She looks at me and then away. I walk over and sit down next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; I ask. She nods although she&#39;s still not looking at me. I move my hand onto hers, I expect her to move her hand out of mine, but she doesn&#39;t. This is reminiscent of how she was six months ago in the hospital. I look at Sara to see her watching us. She sits in her chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want Megan to get assessed for PTSD,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I state and then look at Megan as her hand tightens on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She needs to get assessed, but in the meantime, she will need more sessions,&#34; Sara explains. &#34;Three a week,&#34; she then turns to Megan. &#34;Can I tell him what we discussed regarding where we are at?&#34; she asks her. Megan nods. &#34;If I feel she is becoming a danger to herself, I will have to put her under a section, she is trying to shut her emotions out, and it&#39;s not healthy for her,&#34; she explains. I look at Megan, I want to ask her what she means. &#34;I can&#39;t force her to accept her feelings, no one can, only she can do it,&#34; she states, and I know she&#39;s saying that to make me understand I can&#39;t push her to tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I say, while giving Megan&#39;s hand a small squeeze. She looks down at our hands, her thumb rubs against my hand before she lets go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we go?&#34; Megan asks. Sara nods, I stand, and so does Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll see you Wednesday, ok?&#34; Sarah asks. Megan nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both walk out of her office. Megan signs the book and then walks out of the building. I turn to Sara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will she be ok?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hopefully, I might be wrong, I need a second opinion for this, but she will need to work on herself,&#34; Sara says. Tilting her head, she asks &#34;How are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have my own shrink, thanks,&#34; I say with a small smile, and she laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An honest question is all,&#34; she says with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I say my goodbyes and walk out to see Megan stood by her car, waiting for me. She holds her car keys out to me once I get to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She said I&#39;m not in the right mind frame to drive like I&#39;m going to go drive off a cliff or something,&#34; she mutters and then Max runs past me to her. He jumps up onto her, knocking her into the car. She smiles and strokes behind his ears. This dog has the best worst timing ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; I hear David say. &#34;He was scratching at the window to get to her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; she says and kneels down to his height so that he&#39;s not putting all of his weight on her. &#34;You&#39;re honestly the cutest dog,&#34; she coos, stroking him to the point he lays down onto his back so she can rub his belly. She then looks up, &#34;Why are you here, David?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone needs to take his car back,&#34; David responds. She nods and opens the back door to let Max in. He jumps in and looks at us with his tongue hanging out. Megan laughs before getting into the passenger seat. David looks at me, &#34;We&#39;ll talk later,&#34; he says and walks back to my car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get in the car. Max has his head resting on the armrest between Megan and me. He looks at me then to Megan, I shake my head and start the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you have my dog wrapped around your finger?&#34; I ask. She looks at Max and strokes his head before shrugging and turning to look out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach forward to turn the radio on as the silence seems to be deafening. An old song comes through the speakers that make me tap along to the tune on the steering wheel. Nothing can make me understand what she&#39;s feeling right now. If I could comfort her, I would, but I don&#39;t think she would allow me to. I glance at her when we come to a red light. She&#39;s biting her nails on one hand while the other wipes the tear from her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to go for a coffee?&#34; I ask. She shakes her head, &#34;doughnuts?&#34; She loves Krispy Kreme. She looks at me and shakes her head. &#34;Ok, well I&#39;m craving something sweet, so, I&#39;ll get some,&#34; I say and turn towards the nearest Krispy Kreme. She smiles, and it&#39;s like she is trying to hide it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; she mutters and looks back out the window. I smile to myself as I know she can never resist Krispy Kreme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I have the doughnuts, we set off back home. She looks to the back seat; I look up in the rearview mirror to see what she&#39;s looking at. Max is sitting staring at the boxes of doughnuts and salivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do to him for him to not attack the doughnuts?&#34; she asks and then looks at the box of three I had got just for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s well trained; I got him a plain one, so he&#39;ll be happy when we get back,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think I&#39;m crazy?&#34; she asks suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I do,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not, what&#39;s the worst thing that could happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, let&#39;s see; I&#39;m going to be on medication for the rest of my life. They might as well stick me in the loony-bin with Jonathon,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In all honesty, Megan, PTSD is manageable, and you might not have it. She might think you have it because of how severely depressed you are,&#34; I explain and we stop at another traffic light. I look at her, &#34;I want you to know that I didn&#39;t know you were in yesterday morning, I thought you had gone out,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; she snaps and looks away from me. &#34;I just wished you had told me you had a girlfriend rather than me finding out like that,&#34; I frown at what she&#39;s saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She isn&#39;t my girlfriend,&#34; I say shocked. She looks at me and frowns. &#34;I&#39;m serious, she&#39;s a friend, I&#39;ve known her for a while, but she isn&#39;t my girlfriend,&#34; I explain. &#34;Wait, is that why you were so angry?&#34; I ask. She shrugs, and I take that as a yes. I sigh and look back at the lights to see them turn green.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We drive back in silence; the only sound is from the radio and Max whimpering every now and then at the doughnuts.</p>
