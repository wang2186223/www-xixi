                <p>Taking my earrings out, I look at myself in the vanity mirror. Tomorrow we fly back home and I&#39;m not sure how I feel about that. Logan has told me there will be measures in place to keep me safe but in all honesty I&#39;m scared. If he gets me this time I know he will kill me. The thought of my father just waiting to grab me, I&#39;ve tried my best not to even think about it in the remaining time we&#39;ve got left here just because I know where my thoughts will go. I know how depressed I&#39;ll be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My bedroom door opens. I look in the mirror to see it&#39;s Logan. He walks towards me and sits on the buffet next to me. He kisses my exposed shoulder and then moves my hand into his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are there still people downstairs?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, they&#39;re all heading home as we speak,&#34; he states &#34;What are you doing?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was about to take my make-up off and get ready for bed,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; he states, frowning a little. I smile and move closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And then hopefully finish what we started earlier,&#34; I continue before pressing my lips to his.I feel him smile and then move his hands to my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You read my mind,&#34; he states and then kisses my lips before pulling fully away from me. &#34;But leave your makeup and dress on, I want you to come with me,&#34; he states while he holds his hand out for me. I frown and stand up as I take his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we going?&#34; I ask as he leads me out of my bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To my room,&#34; he states and then I hear giggling. I look behind me to see Yasmin with Carl. I raise my eyebrows as I watch them kiss. Logan tilts his head before shrugging and walking towards his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s most likely going to regret tonight,&#34; I say in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I doubt it,&#34; he states and makes me stand in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s chemistry between them, they probably both deny it but he&#39;s into her more than he lets on,&#34; he explains. &#34;Now close your eyes I have a surprise for you,&#34; I frown and close my eyes for him. I feel his hands move over my eyes and then hear the bedroom door open. He walks me into the room and I hear the door shut behind him. &#34;Ok,&#34; he says and he sounds nervous. I smile a little and place my hand onto his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I see yet?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never done anything like this before, I feel like I&#39;m being a big ball of cheese,&#34; he states and I giggle. &#34;Ok,&#34; he says again and I feel his hand move away. &#34;Open,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I do as he says and see the room illuminated by candle light. There&#39;s candles all over. Some large, some small, lighting the room into a warm dim glow. He moves his hand into mine making me look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re my cheese ball and I love it,&#34; I say with a smile and kiss him on the lips. He visibly relaxes and gives me a lopsided smile. &#34;You do the most random romantic things,&#34; I say, turning to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you like it?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could get used to it,&#34; I state and kiss him. I feel his hands move to my waist and pull me closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My nerves kick in as I feel his body against mine. After what I said to him earlier I know what is going to happen and it makes me nervous. Not because I don&#39;t want to but because of my own fears. I know he would stop if I asked him to and I know that if I said to him I didn&#39;t want to, that he wouldn&#39;t pressure me. He then pulls back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One sec,&#34; he says walking to the door and locking it, after earlier I don&#39;t want anyone walking in on us. I nod as he stands in front of me. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he asks moving his hands through my hair and making me look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m nervous,&#34; I say honestly and move my hands down his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A good nervous though, I meant what I said earlier, I&#39;m just nervous is all,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there anything I can do?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I think it&#39;s normal,&#34; I say with a small smile and unbutton the top buttons of his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is,&#34; he says and I look up at him. He leans forward and kisses the top of my head. I smile a little and move onto my tiptoes to kiss him on the lips. The kiss is slow, he&#39;s kissing me back but not taking control and I know he&#39;s doing it to calm me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands move down to my waist and slowly pull the zip of my dress down. His actions are slow and methodical, giving me a chance to stop him if I want to. Slowly I start to unbutton down his shirt, my hands are a little shaky causing me to take longer than it did in the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We move towards the bed and I&#39;m finally able to get his shirt off. He pulls away from me and guides my dress down. This I think will always make me nervous. My scars are far from fading and I can&#39;t help but want to cover myself. I close my eyes and rest my head against his bare chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; I say quietly. &#34;I just hate the way my body looks,&#34; I say and move my hands up his muscular chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t,&#34; he says and makes me look him in the eyes. I give him a small smile. &#34;I love your body, you&#39;re sexy as hell, was it not evident downstairs?&#34; he asks and I smile at him. &#34;Everytime I look at you I want you,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel myself blush before moving to kiss him. He kisses me back only this time with a little more force than before. I pull the sleeve of my dress off and pull the rest of my zipper down revealing my white bra. His hands move down from my neck to my waist and he presses my body to his. I feel his erection pressed against my stomach as I feel him move my dress down my body. His hands cup my butt when my dress drops at my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan lifts me up and I wrap my legs around his waist. I pull back from the kiss and move my hands through his hair as I look down at him. He has one hand holding me to him at my butt and one hand at the back of my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure about this?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never been so sure of anything in my life,&#34; I reply and kiss him. I feel him move onto the bed and slowly lay me down on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulls away from me and stands at the end of the bed. I watch him unbuckle his belt as he looks down at my body. Taking in the underwear I&#39;m wearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth is I bought this with this night in mind. I decided yesterday that I wanted this and I bought this while shopping. I can&#39;t help but feel how true his words are when he looks at me with such hunger in his eyes. They&#39;re dark with arousal and need. He looks like danger and sex all rolled into one and I&#39;m turned on even more by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan&#39;s trousers drop and he moves onto the bed. Moving his hands up my legs to my white lace thong. He trails hot kisses up my stomach to my neck and then below my ear. I move my hands down his chest to his boxers and back moving my fingers over his nipples. He hooks his fingers into the waistband of my panties and before he pulls them down he whispers in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you I&#39;d be taking them off again,&#34; he states and he licks my neck and I can&#39;t help but smile and feel my body respond to his statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft moan passes my lips as I feel his body pressed against mine and his lips at my chest. I move up onto my elbows. He stops and looks at me before kissing me. I moan and feel him push me back. I wrap my arms around his neck as I kiss him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; he says pulling away from me and moving a hand up my leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm,&#34; I answer as I kiss his neck and move a hand down to his boxers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can stop whenever you want,&#34; he states. I stop and look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know I&#39;m just letting you know that we can,&#34; he states. &#34;If you say stop I will,&#34; he adds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you will.&#34; I say with conviction. He sighs in relief and he looks like a weight has lifted off him. I smile and kiss him on the lips. &#34;Now stop stalling,&#34; I say against his lips. He chuckles and kisses down my neck as his hand moves to my sex. I feel his fingers at my entrance and then move up to my clit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck I love how responsive you are,&#34; he says to me before moving the cups of my lace bra down and licking my nipple. I moan in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then there&#39;s a loud knock on the door making me jump. He stops and looks at me. I gulp as fear takes hold of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan open the fuck up,&#34; I hear Carl demand and then more knocking. I move away from Logan and try to cover myself as I feel my fear rise. He tries the door and I feel my mouth go dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time I was in the position it was with Tyler and my father walked in on us. Logan gets up and walks to the door unlocking it and storming out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck all I need is some condoms, what&#39;s crawled up your arse,&#34; I hear Carl &#34;It&#39;s not like you&#39;re using them,&#34; he adds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s a pause and then the door opens again. Logan walks in shutting the door and walking towards the bedside table. He looks at me and I quickly look away. I want the bed to swallow me up. My fear is a complete arsehole.</p>
