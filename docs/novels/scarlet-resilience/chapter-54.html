                <p>I stand in the headmistress&#39; office as Logan explains my morning to her and what a surprise Tyler had told him about what happened in maths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t good Mr Peters,&#34; she says</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; he asks, frowning at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean we need to set out a timetable for her that she is comfortable with, she obviously isn&#39;t ready for full time school. You need to talk to her grandfather about it,&#34; she said and looked at me.&#34; Would you rather be in school part time maybe a few hours a week and we increase it as time goes on?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My psychologist said that to my grandfather but he didn&#39;t listen,&#34; I said quietly &#34;But I&#39;d prefer to just be in for the more important ones like Math, English, science and Art,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Art?&#34; she asks and Logan looks really offended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to be in design,&#34; I said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh ok well you don&#39;t have to be in for that I guess you could do art at home if it&#39;s a hobby,&#34; she said and sits down and rubs her head. &#34;Mr Broster can be a self-centred jackass sometimes,&#34; my eyes widened a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I don&#39;t mean to swear but the sooner that man retires the better,&#34; she says. She then looks at me &#34;You can go home, what&#39;s your first lesson tomorrow?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;English,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what do you have?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have biology then history and then music and then Art and then Math,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok well come in for English and Biology and then go home ok?&#34; she asks. I nod &#34;You can miss Math that&#39;s not important at the moment,&#34; she says. I smile and she smiles &#34;I don&#39;t sound like a headmistress do I?&#34; she asks &#34;What I wouldn&#39;t give to just get paid to do nothing,&#34; she said and then smiles while leaning back in her chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds like you need a holiday to me,&#34; I said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, yes that is what I need, thank god my husband is paying for me to go to Hawaii for the summer, he&#39;s coming too but it isn&#39;t like he needs it,&#34; she said smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have an all girls holiday my mother used to do that,&#34; I said and stand up &#34;did it like every summer when I went away with friends,&#34; I said &#34;we&#39;d go to the same place but just didn&#39;t interact with each other unless we needed to and my father went also, it was like a family holiday but we never spent any time together we only saw each other in the mornings,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow,&#34; she said and looked at Logan &#34;take her home,&#34; she says. I smile at her and walk out of the office with Logan behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to be ok?&#34; Logan asks me as he sits on the coffee table. I nod and lay my head on the arm of the chair. &#34;Try to get some sleep ok,&#34; he says and strokes my hair. &#34;Please for me,&#34; he adds. I nod a little and he leans in to give me a kiss. I hold up my index finger and yawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only a peck,&#34; I said looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dilly dally shilly shally,&#34; he said smiling and pressed his lips against mine. I smile and tug on the top of his t-shirt and then move my hand through his hair as his tongue caresses my mouth. I pull back and rub my lips</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dilly Dally my arse,&#34; I said &#34;look what you&#39;ve done to my poor mouth,&#34; He smiles and kisses me again &#34;no Logan you really don&#39;t understand the beard burn do you?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he said and kissed my forehead. &#34;I will be back at about four. I have something to do after work,&#34; I frown &#34;it&#39;s a surprise,&#34; he said and smiled at me. &#34;Bye babe,&#34; he said and kissed my head once more and walked out of the living room. I hear the front door shut and I turn on the TV and then grab the blanket on the side and pull it over me wrapping it around my body. I could at least try and get some sleep and keep my promise after all he always tried to keep his. He was most likely to come home at dinner to make me take my medication anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk into the house and look around. I can hear music coming from upstairs. I look up the stairs and see Carl. He beckons me and I follow him to Megan&#39;s room. I peep in to see her playing the piano. She then stops and takes a deep breath and then starts to play again. I look at Carl. I&#39;m sure I know this song and he smiles while watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think she knew I was home when she started playing,&#34; he said to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure I know this song,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah yeah it&#39;s Evanescence or something you know the one with the woman in it. Lithium or something,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ITunes or something?&#34; I ask looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey I could be,&#34; he said and walks into her room making sure she didn&#39;t see him. She then slowly murmurs to the tune. She finished the song but didn&#39;t sing fully to it as if she didn&#39;t want to as if stopping herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then started another song and she sang fully. I lean against her dresser and fold my arms across my chest and tilt my head to the side. She stops and shakes her head and rests her hands on the keys. &#34;Wrong chord stupid,&#34; she said to herself and started again and the tune was a lot softer now. She then pressed the wrong key &#34;For frick sake,&#34; she growls. I smile and walk over to her and sit down on the buffet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down,&#34; I say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;H-How long have you been standing there?&#34; she asks and looks behind her to see Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not long honest,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, well I&#39;m done now,&#34; she said standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you&#39;re not sit down,&#34; I said, grabbing her hips and pulling her back down on the buffet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But,&#34; she starts</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will not shave for the rest of my life if you don&#39;t finish this song,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah you will,&#34; she says,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I won&#39;t,&#34; I said &#34;you will have to put up with beard burn,&#34; I said &#34;I will feel very comfortable looking like a hobo or Jesus if I have to,&#34; I said honestly and she sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; she said and looked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just relax; it&#39;s an easy song,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not relaxing though, watch?&#34; I said and cracked my fingers and started to play the tune she was playing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know the song?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m British and you are playing a song by a British singer. Do I really need to explain?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since when did you play the piano?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Parents were strict on me being good at everything for a while,&#34; I said &#34;now shut up and play,&#34; I ordered and she nodded and started to play again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll sing it one last time for you...&#34; she starts as she plays</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go shave now,&#34; I said now she&#39;s finished. She looks at me and smiles &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t shave a lot. I like it when you have a bit of stubble but not all that,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I&#39;m not pussy footing around for you, I&#39;m shaving it all and then it will grow to what you want,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; she huffs and then stands up. I smile and stand up moving my arms around her, I go to kiss her but she moves away. &#34;Urm I have homework,&#34; she said and walked off towards her bed. I look at Carl and he looks away from me and walks out. I frown and walk out after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happened?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not saying anything, it&#39;s up to her,&#34; he said walking into his room and shutting the door locking it behind him. I sigh and walk into my room.</p>
