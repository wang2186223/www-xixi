                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Logan as I lay opposite him in bed. He was fast asleep, his arms tightly wrapped around me. I was so closed I could feel his breath on my face. I sigh a little and turn to climb out of my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staying in bed with him just seemed impossible to do. We came home and came straight up here and now I can&#39;t sleep, I have been sat watching him for about two hours and I still have the urge to beat him up for what he&#39;s done or hurting him. I wonder if he really did know how much he&#39;s hurt me, he looked like he did when he was begging me to take him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk out of my room down to the living room and lie on the couch and wrap a blanket around me. I then feel someone watching me. I sit up and look around to see Carl stood at the kitchen doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey beautiful,&#34; he says. I sigh and lay back. He walks over to me and sits on the coffee table &#34;you do know there are bedrooms in this place you can sleep in,&#34; he states. I nod and look at him. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Tell me,&#34; he says. I sigh and sit up and he sits next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel like I made a mistake forgiving him,&#34; I said and look at Carl. He sighs and looks up at the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm well honestly I can&#39;t tell you what to feel,&#34; he said and looks at me &#34;but what I can tell you is that this scared him, I watched him while you were gone and he was all over, I think tonight is probably the first night he&#39;s slept,&#34; he said and gets comfy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he&#39;ll do it again,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think he will, he&#39;s never cheated before and he was genuinely scared that he&#39;d lose you for it,&#34; he pauses &#34;plus believe or not you bring the best out of him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What his cheating side and arm breaking jealous side?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendan told you about that?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yep which I am not happy about what makes him think that I want someone who is violent in my life,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He did warn Brendan if that helps,&#34; Carl states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No it doesn&#39;t,&#34; I sigh and bring my legs up to my chest and slowly start to cry &#34;he makes me so angry,&#34; He laughs and hugs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That honestly is the old him, he&#39;s not like that, he is actually quite a sensitive person he just has a dark rebellious side,&#34; he pauses and smirks to himself &#34;which is quite hot,&#34; he said and I laugh a little and he laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiles and moves a bit of hair out of my face &#34;he&#39;s lucky that you&#39;ve forgiven him, he knows it&#39;s his last chance,&#34; he said and I look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah my friends think I shouldn&#39;t forgive him that I should just forget all about him because as the saying goes &#39;once a cheat always a cheat&#39; they stand by that a lot,&#34; I explain and he laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well friends have that impact, but it&#39;s only you who can decide after all it&#39;s your life not anybody else&#39;s,&#34; he said and I smile at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I guess,&#34; I pause and look at him &#34;thanks,&#34; I said and give him a hug. I pull back and without any warning I feel his lips on mine. My eyes widen and I push him back &#34;what are you doing?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just urm,&#34; he starts and I stand up and start to walk out of the room &#34;no Megan wait,&#34; he said and grabs my arm. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he says</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You tell me all this stuff and then you kiss me what the hell Carl, in case you hadn&#39;t noticed my boyfriend is your best friend and he&#39;s upstairs,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want me to tell you the truth. He doesn&#39;t deserve you not after what he&#39;s done and after what he&#39;s hiding,&#34; he snaps. I frown and he stands straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s he hiding?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; he said &#34;just forget I said anything,&#34; I frown and walk forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me what you mean,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing, it&#39;s nothing even bad he&#39;s just not comfortable telling anyone because of the promise he made, just leave it ok, he&#39;ll tell you soon just at the moment he&#39;s scared to,&#34; I sigh and stand straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m telling him you kissed me,&#34; I say. He groans as he looks at me &#34;well it&#39;s your own fault I&#39;m not going to keep things from him not anymore after what my last secret led to,&#34; I said and walk off. I walk back into my bedroom and shut the door quietly behind being careful not to wake Logan. I  then climb into my bed next to him and wrap his arms around me so I&#39;m back facing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said and he holds me more comfortably. &#34;Carl just tried to kiss me,&#34; I say.  He reaches over and turns the lamp on and then looks at me &#34;Don&#39;t be mad,&#34; I said and he smiles a little and turns the lamp back off. He then leans in to kiss me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we sleep now?&#34; he asks. I nod and he lays back down. &#34;Cool,&#34; he said and kisses my forehead. I smile to myself and nuzzle into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan&#39;s hands startle me a little as they touch my hips. I look just to make sure it&#39;s him and it is. They move round to my belly as he kisses me neck. I sigh a little and look down at my tablets. I felt really uncomfortable with him holding me, I had never felt really uncomfortable with him but right now I did. It was bound to go away, I was mostly only feeling uncomfortable because of my nightmares. That was understandable though wasn&#39;t it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to have breakfast?&#34; he asks, I shake my head and he sighs a little but doesn&#39;t push it any further &#34;Ok,&#34; is all he said and takes his arms from around me. &#34;I&#39;m off to get ready,&#34; he said and walks out. I sigh and hold my head in my hands and rest on the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I hear Carl say. I stand straight and look at him &#34;I&#39;m sorry about last night,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; I said and start to take my pills. And as I do Logan walks back in wearing a pale blue shirt that had the top two buttons undone and a tie around his neck untied. He wanted me to come to school today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you not going to get ready?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll go in,&#34; I said and he frowns a little &#34;I&#39;m not feeling well,&#34; I lie. Well technically I wasn&#39;t lying, I felt like running off a cliff that had lava pit at the bottom but he couldn&#39;t know that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look ok,&#34; he said and I sigh a little and look down at my pills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s more mentally,&#34; I said and he sighs a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; he said and goes to kiss me on the lips but I turn so he gets the cheek and he sighs. I look down, what did he expect from me? Shouldn&#39;t he be happy that I have let him near me and forgiven him for what he&#39;s done? Yes I had forgiven him but did it mean I had to act like it never happened as well?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m off back to bed,&#34; I said and walk off up to my room. I shut and lock my bedroom door behind me and lay in my bed while looking through my phone. I hear the front door shut and his car pull out and then I hear another car which is Carls. I sigh to myself and place my phone next to my pillow and try to get some sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few hours pass and I&#39;m laid in bed staring at the ceiling.  Hadn&#39;t slept, I couldn&#39;t sleep no matter how hard I tried a nightmare would start and I would wake myself up before it got right into it. Now I was just left with my thoughts, thoughts I hated; thoughts that made me angry and upset which made me even angrier to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at the clock at the side to see it was half twelve which meant Logan was on his lunch and he&#39;d most likely call me. I wanted him to call me though I didn&#39;t know why when I was still angry with him for what he&#39;s done. I guess it was more to take my mind off of the things I&#39;m thinking about that is making me low. I sigh as I take my phone and hold it above me waiting for it to vibrate and his name blink at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about ten minutes it hadn&#39;t happened and now my phone was now on my stomach. I sit up and look at the time to see it was 13:43pm I frown and look down at my phone but I had no missed calls and no messages.  This was just great I wanted him to ring and he doesn&#39;t what the hell is he doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Fucking another girl&#39; a voice in my head says. I sigh and place my phone on my dresser. He wasn&#39;t and I knew he wasn&#39;t it was probably my paranoia kicking in &#39;that blonde teacher that&#39;s always flirting with him&#39; it said and I groan and move my head onto my lap with my hands round my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just forget about it,&#34; I said out loud and try and think of something else but nothing works. I open my eyes and they land on my box. I sit straight and look at it. He wouldn&#39;t know if I did it now and did it in a place he wouldn&#39;t see. It would most likely make me feel better for a bit and stop me from thinking what I was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach over and pick up my box and open it to see all my things still in it. I take my razor out and pull down my bottoms. This was one place he&#39;d never see just because he would rather sleep with some stranger than me. I hold the blade at the inside of my right leg and take a deep breath and as I do I hear the slamming of a car door. I stand and look out of my window to see Logan walking up the steps. Nerves build up and I quickly start to put everything away. He&#39;d be furious if he knew what I was going to do I know he would after all I was breaking a promise. I had promised him I&#39;d talk to him before I did any of this again.</p>
