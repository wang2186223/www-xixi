                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my body to face Brendan as he pulled up to the house I was living in with Logan. He looked at me and smiled a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re mental, to do a full day drinking binge,&#34; he says. I giggled and closed my eyes &#34;but it seems you&#39;ve had a bit of fun,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm...You should have had something to drink too,&#34; I groaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m driving Megan, as you can see,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah but you would have sobered up,&#34; I stated and pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I wouldn&#39;t because when I drink, I drink to get paralytic drunk,&#34; he said, grinning &#34;sort of like you,&#34; he added. &#34;I&#39;m happy I don&#39;t have to take you back to your granddad&#39;s, that would be a bad scene for me,&#34; he said and then turned the engine off. &#34;Man, I&#39;m tired,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not,&#34; I said, still with my eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could have fooled me,&#34; I heard him say. I smiled and then I felt him kiss my lips and then hug me &#34;It&#39;s weird how he hasn&#39;t phoned you at all to see where you are, I mean I know your granddad has a few times but I don&#39;t understand why he hasn&#39;t. I would have expected your granddad to tell...is it Logan?&#34; I nodded to his question &#34;to tell him you were missing or something,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh well,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Especially with your history with him,&#34; I sat up and looked at him, &#34;you don&#39;t remember telling me?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember telling you what?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About him telling you he loved you and well about the times you two have kissed,&#34; he states. I frowned and then looked at him more &#34;don&#39;t worry I&#39;m not going to say anything I mean it would only cause you drama and well it isn&#39;t like he&#39;s forcing himself on you whenever he can is it?&#34; he asks. I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quite the opposite,&#34; I mumbled and laid back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you obviously like him,&#34; I frowned at him. &#34;I guess you don&#39;t remember most of last night,&#34; he said to himself &#34;I think that may be a good thing because you cried over the fact he didn&#39;t answer your call,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; I said and looked away from him feeling a bit embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be embarrassed,&#34; he said &#34;Don&#39;t feel embarrassed by anything from last night because I loved it,&#34; he said grinning at me. I huffed and folded my arms as he was about me kissing him. &#34;Hey it&#39;s not the first time we&#39;ve kissed, you know, and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve done a little bit more than that kiss,&#34; he said, smirking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok well I&#39;m gonna go I&#39;ll see you around,&#34; I said getting ready to leave. He laughed and moved his arms around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, don&#39;t worry,&#34; he said, pulling me towards him. I gulped a little and looked at him. &#34;I haven&#39;t and won&#39;t ever tell anyone about that night...well,&#34; he said, trailing off. I looked at him. It turns out that my mother saw us go into the pool house that night from her bedroom window.&#34; My jaw dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did tell her we didn&#39;t do anything. Right?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I did, but I don&#39;t think she believed me, but she does now...I think,&#34; he said frowning to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great,&#34; I said, slumping in his arms. &#34;Well, I do need to go and I&#39;ll talk to you whenever,&#34; I said, moving out of his arms and opening the car door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;ll be very soon,&#34;he said as I got out of the car. I gave him a small smile and shut the car door. I slowly made my way up the garden path and turned to give him a small wave. He waved back and then started the engine again. I walked into the house after he drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pungent aroma hit me as soon as I started to walk towards the living room. I knew the smell well. I had smelt the other day and Logan smelt of it when we picked him up from the police station. I stood at the door and saw him smoking what seemed to be weed. He was dressed in complete black and he was watching Tom and Jerry. I looked at Carl who was now looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; he asks. I nodded and looked back at Logan to see him chuckle to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I fucking love this programme,&#34; Logan said to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you&#39;re going to love it, you are high,&#34; Carl said, standing up and walking towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong with him?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, why don&#39;t you go up to bed,&#34; he said while moving me out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, just go,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I need to talk to him, to tell him something,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you tell him in the morning?&#34; he asked. I frowned a little and slowly started to make my way to the stairs &#34;thanks,&#34; he said and walked back into the living room. I stopped and walked towards the living room and stood outside it while listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was that?&#34; Logan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; Carl said &#34;and make that your last one,&#34; he ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she ok?&#34; he asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, it seems she&#39;s had a bit to drink though,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When doesn&#39;t she, if she&#39;s not drinking then she&#39;s crying or like an actual zombie,&#34; he states</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you expect?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I expect it I&#39;m just pointing it out; I&#39;m off to go check on her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you&#39;re not,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I am,&#34; and I hear movement. I quickly made my way upstairs as quietly as I could and then got changed into some clean clothes and walked into the bathroom to run myself a bath. When I walked back into my bedroom I saw him sitting there on my bed flicking through my phone. &#34;Who&#39;s Brendan?&#34; he asks, &#34;he just sent you a text,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm just a friend,&#34; I said and went to take my phone off him but he moved it away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You called him the night you called me,&#34;he said looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I needed someone to talk to and well you didn&#39;t answer so I phoned him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not Melanie?&#34; he asks &#34;she is your best friend,&#34; I frown at him. ~Why is he questioning me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because Melanie isn&#39;t exactly in the greatest of places right now, why are you even asking me that question does it really matter?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah it does,&#34; he said and then he moved his arms around me. I frowned, confused by his sudden move. &#34;I need a hug,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm ok,&#34; I slowly said and hugged him back. &#34;Why do you need a hug?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because Carl has taken my weed off me,&#34; he huffed. I moved his arms from around me and walked into my bathroom then back out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you a stoner?&#34; I ask. He looked at me tilted his head a little and smirked. &#34;Oh my god you are,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...No I&#39;m not or at least I don&#39;t think I am, but you have to understand I&#39;m in a bad way at the moment,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bad way how?&#34; I ask . He sighs and looks away from me &#34;great so  you know everything about me and I know nothing about you,&#34; I paused. &#34;You could at least open up to me you know, like how I open up to you, and then you wonder why I don&#39;t always tell you what&#39;s on my mind,&#34; I said and walked into the bathroom once more and then walked back out &#34;I&#39;m going in the bath I&#39;d really like it if you weren&#39;t here when I have finished,&#34; I snapped and walked into the bathroom shutting and locking the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I was being a bitch but how was I supposed to trust someone who doesn&#39;t tell me anything about themselves?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed and looked at my bath, the tap was still running and it was nowhere near done. I got undressed anyway and got in while the tap ran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After twenty minutes I walked out of the bathroom with a towel tightly wrapped around my body and looked around my room and laid there fast asleep on my bed was Logan. I rolled my eyes and walked into my wardrobe to get dried and dressed. Once dressed I walked out of my wardrobe and looked at him, his arms resting over his head blocking out any light and he was laid on his stomach with his legs crossed. I smirked at the fact his feet hung off the end of my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to move him?&#34; I heard Carl say. I looked at him and shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Its fine, I don&#39;t sleep much anyway. I think its best not to disturb him because he needs to sleep his high off,&#34; I said as I walked to my bed and moved back the covers. &#34;And well it isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve shared a bed with him,&#34; I mumbled and reached for my lamp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok then well I&#39;ll see you in the morning. Night,&#34; he said and shut the door behind him and then he opened it again and Max walked in and laid at the side of my bed. I smiled a little and got comfy while pulling my covers over my body.</p>
