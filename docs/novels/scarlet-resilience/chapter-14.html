                <p>&#34;LOGAN!!&#34; I heard Megan scream. I shot up and ran into her room looking straight at her bed to see she wasn&#39;t there. Then I heard a small whimper come behind me to the left. I looked to see she was standing there, her eyes watering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I asked her, &#34;Did you have another nightmare?&#34; she shook her head &#34;then what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a spider,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I am not sure if I am hearing right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look,&#34; she said turning me and pushing me towards the wall opposite near her walk in wardrobe and there on the wall was a spider &#34;you can&#39;t miss it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said &#34;and it&#39;s not that big,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s bigger than my freaking face,&#34; she nearly yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok ok it&#39;s big,&#34; I then smirked slightly as a thought came into my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You dirty minded man,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh come on you&#39;re just as dirty minded as me for thinking of the same thing,&#34; I argued. She sighs and looks at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OMG it&#39;s moving please hurry up and get rid of it,&#34; she paused. &#34;And your dog isn&#39;t any help, he just looked at it and went back to sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes and looked at the spider; it was fairly big, roughly about three inches if I counted the legs which were quite thick. I walked towards it and cupped it into my hands holding it. I turned and looked at her and she backed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know you screamed as if you were getting murdered,&#34; I said smiling. She frowned and then stepped back as I stepped forward &#34;why are you so afraid of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just get rid of it,&#34; she snapped. I sigh and walk out of the room and she follows me.  I stopped when I saw Carl walk out of a spare room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spider,&#34; I state. He frowned and walked over to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me see,&#34;he said, holding his hand out. I slowly handed him it and it crawled onto his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urgh,&#34; Megan cringed, &#34;you&#39;re both freaks,&#34; she said, running down the stairs. I rolled my eyes and took the spider back, &#34;don&#39;t forget to kill it,&#34; she called as I walked down the staircase to the front door. I looked at her to see her hiding. I chuckled and shook my head at her and then opened the front door and walked out. I placed the spider onto the lawn and then walked back into the house to see her standing at the living room doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No spiders see,&#34; I said, holding up my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; she said and cringed, &#34;Urgh I hate spiders,&#34; she said walking into the living room.  I sigh and shake my head as I walk into the living room &#34;I&#39;m sorry for waking you by the way but that thing could have eaten me,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok,&#34; I said and walked past her &#34;What do you want for breakfast?&#34; I ask . She remained silent and I looked at her &#34;Megan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything,&#34; she said and sat on the couch while flicking through the channels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want some cereal?&#34; I ask . She looked at me and stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can make it myself,&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said and looked at Carl &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything to get rid of this hangover of mine,&#34;he said sitting at the kitchen table. Megan looked at him and then smirked slightly. &#34;Guessing you don&#39;t have a hangover?&#34; he asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m used to them,&#34; she said quietly and walked to the fridge to get the milk out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember anything from last night?&#34; I ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything,&#34; she muttered. I looked at her and then she looked at me &#34;I always do unfortunately,&#34; she says. I sigh and start to make mine and Carl&#39;s breakfast. I wasn&#39;t too happy that she remembered, it just made things awkward and difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She poured cornflakes into a bowl and then some milk. I looked at how much she had put in which was quite a fair amount. I frowned a little as she barely ate breakfast and yet she was willing to eat a bowl full of cornflakes. &#34;Can you take me to see Melanie today?&#34; she asks as she walks to the table with her bowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah if you like but we need to go clothes shopping for you,&#34; her head shot at me as soon as I finished my sentence &#34;yeah I don&#39;t like shopping but you need some clothes you can&#39;t keep wearing jogging bottoms,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have clothes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. They don&#39;t fit you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ll fit me soon,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not soon enough,&#34; I state &#34;all you need to get is a few jeans and a few tops,&#34; I state. She sighs and looks down at her bowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really don&#39;t want to go outside,&#34; she muttered. I frowned slightly, &#34;everyone watches the news,&#34; she muttered. I sigh as I walk to the fridge to take out some bacon and eggs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one will notice you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes they will, it&#39;s a small town and all the people at my school go to the mall every day,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going in school hours you won&#39;t see any of them,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; she huffed and then picked her bowl up. I opened my mouth to say &#34;upstairs before you ask and I will be down within twenty minutes with the bowl empty and I will be sober. You can even smell my breath if you like,&#34; she snapped moodily as she walked out of the kitchen. I sigh and turn to the cooker to make mine and Carl breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan come on,&#34; I said, calling her from the bottom of the staircase. I heard groan and then start to stomp her feet as she walked. &#34;You know stomping your feet isn&#39;t going to change my mind,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I don&#39;t want to go,&#34; I heard her whinge like a five year old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t get your arse down these stairs now I&#39;ll come up and get you,&#34; I warned and I suddenly felt like a parent. I scrunch my face up a little at that thought. I waited for another minute and then sighs &#34;right I&#39;m coming up,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...No I&#39;m coming,&#34; she said quickly, almost in a frightened tone. Then she walked round the corner of the staircase and stood there with her bottom lip out and her hands clasped in front of her. I smirked a little at how cute she looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was that so hard?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes actually I couldn&#39;t find anything to wear so now you have to walk around the mall with someone who looks like a tramp,&#34; she snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look fine now, stop moaning,&#34; I paused. &#34;And anyway I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re so worried about people looking at you when they&#39;ll all be looking at me with my great biceps and that,&#34; I said smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seen better,&#34; she said, tilting her head and walking past me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure you have that scrawny ex-boyfriend of yours I highly doubt it,&#34; I said following her out of the house. I locked the door and then turned to see her already standing at the car door. &#34;I&#39;m kidding by the way,&#34; I said walking towards my car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok,&#34; she said and opened the car door once I unlocked the car. I got in the car and sighs &#34;Why do you always sigh?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a habit,&#34; I mutter. &#34;I let out frustration through sighing and apparently sighing is quite therapeutic because it&#39;s like lifting whatever is on your mind off it if you get what I mean,&#34; she nodded and I started the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need a new phone as well,&#34; she said as we got onto the main roads. I looked at her &#34;the police still have my phone or it&#39;s still at home I&#39;m not sure,&#34; she paused &#34;but either way I need a new one,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What sort of phone do you want?&#34; I ask  her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same one as last time,&#34; she states while looking out the window &#34;it&#39;s gonna rain,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well good job we&#39;re not going to be outside,&#34; I said and turned on the radio. She sighs deeply and mutters something under her breath. &#34;C&#39;mon stop worrying no one is going to recognise who you are,&#34; I state while taking her hand in mine. She moved her hand out of my hand and turned her body away from me.</p>
