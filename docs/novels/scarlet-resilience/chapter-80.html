                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin stands and holds onto me by my hair dragging me up to my feet and to the other door. He locks the door and then looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you making me do this Megs?&#34; he asks. I sigh and he lets go of my hair. He walks towards me and moves his hand to my cheek and wipes the blood from my top lip and then pull me towards him into a hug. I don&#39;t hug him back, I try not to touch him but it&#39;s probably the most impossible thing right now when he&#39;s pushing his body against mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands move from my back down to bum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My boyfriend is going to kill you,&#34; I said in his ear and he pulls back and punches me in the face. I land on the floor and as soon as I do I start to crawl. Laughter echoes from him but I ignore it. I knew he&#39;d punch me after saying that after all it&#39;s probably the last thing he wants to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crawl behind the bar and look around. I was not going to have him touching me again in anyway. I&#39;m going to hurt him this time no matter what even if it involves hurting myself in the process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megs,&#34; he said almost as if in amusement just like he has before. I slide open the cupboards under the bar and there in front of me in all it&#39;s shiny glory is a small knife. The kind you use to cut fruit. &#34;Megs,&#34; he said again. I take the knife and shut the cupboard door. I place the knife on one of the shelves that stores beer glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am now trapped and I had two choices, do what I&#39;m planning or let him do what he&#39;s planning. There was only one way out from behind this bar and he is now standing unbuckling his jeans at the way out. He walks towards me and kneels down to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon be a good girl,&#34; he said moving my hair behind my ear and then moving his hand down to my leg and underneath my dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tries to push me back but I don&#39;t let him and this seemed to make him angrier with me. He grabs my hands and pins me down on the floor and kisses my neck. I relax my body the best I can and try not to fight him back. I want him to let go of my hands and this is the only way I can make him trust me enough to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He does as I want and let&#39;s go of my hands to move his hands over my body. I try to reach for the knife that I had placed on the shelf near me. Reaching for it seemed impossible my fingertips are only an inch away from it maybe a little more. My heart was panicking if I can&#39;t reach this one thing then I may as well lay back and squeeze my eyes shut and just wish I&#39;m somewhere else. That did not mean I shouldn&#39;t at least try to reach the knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I risk bending my body slightly hoping he doesn&#39;t notice what I am doing but it seems he is too bust trying to get my panties off which he succeeds in but I succeed too. I place the knife next to my hip and hold tightly onto the handle. Taking in a deep breath I lift my arm up to the side and plunge the small blade into his back. I take the blade out and he kneels up putting his hand to his back. My eyes narrow on him and I sit up and stab him again and twist the knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An odd feeling starts to raise in me a feeling I wouldn&#39;t expect from doing this but I felt it. I enjoyed it. I enjoy this moment right now watching him feel pain and watching him bleed for once it&#39;s a little overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megs,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name&#39;s not fucking Megs,&#34; I growl and push him back so he falls on his back. I hold the knife in my hands and hold my legs to my chest glaring at him. I don&#39;t want to move he could be faking like he did last time, he could be one of those people that are really horrible but never seem to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel liquid on my arm. I place my fingers to my cheeks and realise I&#39;m crying a lot, like I&#39;ve been crying this whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bang echoes through the room and takes me out of my thoughts. I hold the knife tighter as I hear another bang and then another until suddenly a thud. I gulp and fixate on Benjamin&#39;s body lying in front of me. His eyes are still open and blinking. He&#39;s trying his best to stop the bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I hear that British voice said and a sudden feeling of relief wash over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I said and drop the knife and crawl over Benjamin&#39;s body out from the bar and then I see him stood at the door. &#34;Logan,&#34; I cry getting up and running to him. He hugs me tightly but I&#39;m a hundred percent sure it&#39;s not as tight as I&#39;m holding onto him. &#34;I&#39;m...so...glad...you&#39;re...here...I thought...&#34; I said through my fit of tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My grandfather walks in and immediately runs to Benjamin. I ignore it though, I know he sees him as his son still but I don&#39;t see that person laying there as my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d never leave you,&#34; Logan said holding me tightly. I can&#39;t seem to stop myself from crying at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phone an ambulance,&#34; My grandfather says. Logan doesn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let him die,&#34; Logan said &#34;after all he deserves it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Michelle phone an ambulance,&#34; he snaps. I look to see her stood at the door. She nods but seems hesitant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take me home,&#34; I said &#34;please,&#34; I add and he nods. The look on his face and how tense his body is tells me just how angry he is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car is silent only the smooth humming sound of the engine nothing more. Logan was still angry, his body was all tense and rigid. He keeps clenching his hands into fists and taking deep breaths. We come to a traffic light and the car slowly stops. Logan sighs to himself and clenches his hands once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I said looking down at my dress. It&#39;s covered in blood and torn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What for?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm...I,&#34; I try to said why and I honestly don&#39;t know but I feel like I need to be sorry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be sorry for anything,&#34; he said and takes my hand in his. I flinch and seethe in a breath as pain shoots up my hand. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he asks and takes his hand away and on his fingers is blood. I look at my hand to see it&#39;s sliced open. Logan sighs and as the light turns green he starts to drive. &#34;I&#39;m just annoyed at myself,&#34; he said and I watch him pull into a gas station. He looks me in the eyes and then looks my body up and down and then looks away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry about my dress,&#34; I said and he frowns at me &#34;you liked it and now...&#34; I trail off and look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Its fine I&#39;ll get you a new one a nicer one,&#34; he said and unbuckles his seatbelt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you got something for me to wear I really don&#39;t want to wear this,&#34; I say. He looks at the back seat and then looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have this t-shirt,&#34; he said tugging at his t-shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok I&#39;ll wait until we get home,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...&#34; he said frowning &#34;let me just go in there get a few things and then I&#39;ll let you wear it,&#34; he said smiling and kisses the top of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If there&#39;s any underwear in there will you get me some?&#34; I ask and he nods and gets out of the car. I lean over and lock the door after him and put the radio on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about five minutes I watch Logan return to the car. He goes to open the door and I lean forward and unlock it. He gets in and places the bag on his lap. He takes out a pair of skin coloured tights and a pair of scissors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They don&#39;t sell underwear but they sell tights and scissors,&#34; he said and starts to cut the tights</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What else have you bought?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A bandage for your hand, some wipes and some chocolate,&#34; he said and looks at me. I watch him finish off cutting the tights into small skin coloured boxers and then. He then takes the bandage roll out of the bag and the wipes. He hands me a wipe and I automatically try to clean my face. &#34;It hurts doesn&#39;t it,&#34; he states rather than asks as I slowly try to wipe my nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A little,&#34; I said and look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to do it?&#34; he asks as he starts wiping my hand. I shake my head and carry on. After about ten minutes I&#39;m clean bandaged and wearing his t-shirt and the boxers he&#39;s made me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re all going to ask me what&#39;s happened,&#34; I said quietly as Logan pulls out of the gas station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No they&#39;re not, I phoned Carl and told him briefly what&#39;s happened and told him to tell the others to not ask,&#34; he said and I look at him. &#34;Was that wrong of me?&#34; he asks and I shake my head in response. &#34;I&#39;m sorry if it is but it seemed the best thing to do,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; I said &#34;I just want a shower and my bed,&#34; I said and get comfy &#34;my body aches,&#34;</p>
