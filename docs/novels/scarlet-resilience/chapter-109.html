                <p>I feel Megan move in my arms. I rub at my eyes and move my hand over her hair. Her hair feels wet. I lean over her and turn the light on to see her crying and sweat beading at forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I say, shaking her awake. She shoots up with a scream. I hold her tightly to me and hush her quiet. &#34;It&#39;s ok,&#34; I say and she starts to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He knows,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In my nightmare he was punishing me for what we&#39;ve just done,&#34; she sobs. &#34;He&#39;ll know,&#34; she cries. I shake my head and hold her and kiss her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen to me,&#34; I say turning her to face me and cupping her head in my hands. &#34;He knows nothing, it was a nightmare, it wasn&#39;t real, nothing is going to happen,&#34; I say wipe her tears with my thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He hurt you and he&#39;s going to that&#39;s what happened last time,&#34; she says and looks down. I sigh and kiss her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything is going to be ok,&#34; I say as she cries into my shoulder. I don&#39;t even know what to say to her. All I can do is keep reminding her that it was a nightmare and not real but I know that it isn&#39;t enough and that it isn&#39;t helping her. &#34;Do you want me to do anything?&#34; I ask. She shakes her head and presses her body closer to mine. I lean back with her in my arms and wait patiently, kissing her head every few seconds and stroking her arm with my fingers trying my best to soothe her. I hate this, I hate feeling so useless and helpless. I know that there is one thing I can do which I have discussed with David but going through with it would be a big commitment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stretch out in bed, I can&#39;t feel Logan anywhere in the bed so I had all the room in the world to fully stretch. My eyes flicker open and I&#39;m blinded by the bright light of the sun beaming through the giant window. I turn away from the sight of the sun and see Logan stood staring down at me. I give him a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning gorgeous,&#34; he says and I smile. I love his accent it&#39;s just beautiful to wake up to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; I say and sit up. He sits down on the bed and kisses me on the lips. &#34;How come you didn&#39;t wake me?&#34; I ask and look at the clock at the side to see it&#39;s nearly eleven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t want to, you looked too peaceful,&#34; he says and leans in to kiss me again. I smile and move my hand through his hair to feel it&#39;s damp. He takes me by the waist and moves me on top of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should get a shower,&#34; I say as he kisses down my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I join you?&#34; he whispers in my ear and moves his hands down to my bum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you&#39;ve already had a shower,&#34; I say and slowly move off him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll enjoy it more though with you,&#34; he says standing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No because you don&#39;t seem to have showering in mind,&#34; I say and stand up. &#34;Now be a good boy while I shower,&#34; I say walking into the ensuite bathroom. I start to dry my hair and then quickly put my make up on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk out of the bedroom and see David and Logan look at me. I give them both a small smile. Logan looks like he&#39;s doing something wrong. David just stands and holds his hands behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning Miss Wright,&#34; he says with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; I say with a small smile and sit down next to Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I shall see you for the airport later Sir,&#34; he says and walks out of our room. I look at Logan and lean back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What were you talking about? It seemed serious,&#34; I say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t, it was just about the flights back, are you going to wear those nude heels I bought you?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was going to wear the black flats why?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love it when you wear heels,&#34; he says with a small smile. &#34;I like heels on a woman,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go get them and then you can tell me how they look,&#34; I say walking into the bedroom to get them. I put them on and walk out to show Logan. He smiles at me and then pulls me by my hand towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yep I knew you&#39;d look good in them,&#34; he says and I smile a little and move my hand to my stomach. &#34;Hungry?&#34; he asks and I nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So am I,&#34; he says and takes my hand in his. I reach for my blazer on the arm of the sofa and take it with me as we leave the hotel room. &#34;How do the heels feel?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re comfier than I expected,&#34; I say and look down at my feet as we walk down the large corridor to the elevator. He moves his hand out of my hand to the small of my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good,&#34; he says and looks at me with a small smile on his face. I frown a little at him and run a hand through my hair. &#34;How are you feeling today?&#34; he asks as we stop at the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ok,&#34; I say and the doors to the elevator open. He walks in and so do I, he presses the ground floor button and then turns to me and moves his hands around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m asking because of your nightmare this morning,&#34; he says and I look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine honest, I realise it was a nightmare,&#34; I say and he nods and presses his lips to mine. I smile and wrap my arms around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It made me think though, that maybe I rushed you a little bit,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I say as soon as those words left his lips. &#34;I wanted to do everything that we did last night, you know that,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm true,&#34; he says with a small smile and kisses me and then down my neck. &#34;I really like your outfit today, these jeans are nice,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did pick them,&#34; I say with a small laugh and move my hand through his hair as the elevator doors open. &#34;I have brilliant taste then,&#34; he says in my ear as his hands move to my bum.I giggle and look at the couple that is walking into the elevator and my eyes widen at who it is. I move Logan&#39;s hands from around me and turn his head to make him see who it is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stood in front of us is the headmistress from school with her husband. THey walk in and stand next to Logan, I move away from him as far as I can and take a deep breath to calm myself down. This is the worst thing in the world to happen. I look towards Logan to see he looks relatively calm. I feel him take my hand but I move my hand away from him. Awkward did not describe this situation enough, I don&#39;t think my heart has pounded so much against my ribcage in a long time.</p>
