                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Logan. Eric and Lynn had left and Logan was now sat on the couch with his head up so he was facing the ceiling. I sigh as he hadn&#39;t said a word since he told Eric to go away. He looked like a statue. He was so still. It was almost scary as I wasn&#39;t used to him like this, I was normally the one acting strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; he suddenly said. I blinked out of my daze and looked at him to see him looking at me. &#34;Do you want to go out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm...&#34; I gulped a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll go out in the city and I&#39;ll pay for your drinks and if anyone tries it on with you or starts with you I&#39;ll kill them. I&#39;m sort of a master in that at the moment,&#34;he said tilting his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm no you&#39;ve had quite a bit to drink and it&#39;d be a bad idea if you get anymore alcohol in your system,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34;he said and looked back at the ceiling and then looked back at me &#34;come here,&#34;he said, wafting his arm to me. I looked at him and I just saw this image of my father. I squeezed my eyes shut and sat down on the couch he was sitting on but sat a space away from him. &#34;You&#39;re amazing,&#34;he said, smiling at me; I remained silent and looked at the TV that was on low. There was an old episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation on as usual. &#34;But you won&#39;t admit it will you?&#34; he asked and it seemed he wanted an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not really,&#34; I mumbled. He then stood up and walked off into the kitchen. I let out a breath I didn&#39;t know I was holding. I don&#39;t know why I saw my father for that moment but it was something he did because Logan has been nothing but gentle with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I then felt his hand on my head. I looked up to see him look down at me and smile and then hold a bottle of vodka to his lips. I sigh a little and look away from him. I stood and took the bottle off him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; he asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t have any more to drink,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the hell not?&#34;he said, raising his voice. I closed my eyes and opened them again and walked away from him and then he grabbed my arm &#34;Give it back,&#34; he snapped and went to snatch it out of my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Logan please just stop,&#34; I said and moved fully away from him. His blue eyes glared at me as if he hated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; he hissed &#34;Why the fuck should I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you&#39;re scaring me,&#34; I said quietly and everything fell silent just the TV making noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighs and I put the vodka bottle down on the glass coffee table. I wiped my cheek and went to walk away when I felt him take my arm and pull me to him. His arms came round me and held me tightly. I closed my eyes and hugged him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34;he said and kissed the top of my head. I sigh and just held him &#34;I&#39;ve had a shit day and doing this isn&#39;t going to make anything better I know,&#34;he said &#34;I&#39;m sorry for taking it out on you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Its fine,&#34; I said quietly and pulled away &#34;I&#39;m gonna go to bed,&#34; I said and made my way out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once up in my room I leaned against the door and slowly started to cry. Why did he get so drunk in the first place? He even said he only drinks when he&#39;s out with friends yet here he was practically as drunk as much as my father. I squeezed my eyes shut and sloped to my bed dropping on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the door open which made me open my eyes. I looked at Logan and watched him sit at the side of me. He sighs and moved his hands through his hair and then looked at me. I slowly moved my hand out and he took my hand in his. He lay down on my bed facing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happened?&#34; I ask  him &#34;you can tell me I mean I tell you practically everything,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing I&#39;ve just been stupid today,&#34;he says. I sigh slightly knowing he didn&#39;t trust me to tell me what was going on. &#34;My friend died today,&#34; he suddenly said. &#34;You know my friend you met?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her,&#34;he says,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; I said and moved closer to him &#34;I&#39;m guessing you were really close?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very,&#34;he says. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I upset you,&#34;he said moving his hand out of mine and wiped away the nearly dry tears &#34;so much so I brought you to tears,&#34;he states and moved closer to me &#34;I guess my kiss has gone out of the window?&#34; he asks. I smiled &#34;it&#39;s funny you only smile when you&#39;re alone with me,&#34;he said &#34;I hope it&#39;s a genuine smile,&#34;he said thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well sometimes you make me forget about what&#39;s happened, which I thought was impossible for anyone to do,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled to himself and then looked me in the eyes still smiling &#34;can I have my kiss?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re drunk and I don&#39;t want you to regret it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t,&#34;he said quickly &#34;all I ever want to do is kiss you,&#34;he said frowning as if he was confused by it. I smiled and he looked at me again &#34;so can I?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded timidly as no one had ever asked me if they could kiss me. He smiled and leaned in and I closed my eyes once I felt his lips on mine. I started to kiss him back as he moved his lips against mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands moved around my waist and he pulled me closer to him so our bodies were almost touching. He licked my bottom lip and I parted my lips a little and he moved his hand to my cheek down my neck and over my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled back and looked down at his hand to see him move it to my hip. I gulped and looked at him and then away.  &#34;Sorry,&#34;he said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be,&#34; I said quietly and I felt him kiss my forehead and then hug me tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I sleep in here with you tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do whatever,&#34; I mumbled as I closed my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I will,&#34;he said taking my hand in his and moving on his back so I was laid on his chest &#34;I think I need to get changed and so do you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmmm, no,&#34; I mumbled as I could feel myself drifting off to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit up a minute,&#34; I did as he said and then watched him take his top off. I felt myself blush and I looked away from him. He had a six pack and I swear I had just died a little inside as I looked at him. He pulled me onto his chest and I could just picture how red my cheeks were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I ask you something?&#34; I said sitting up and looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just did but go on,&#34;he said moving his hand to my face and moving hair out of my face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you shave or wax your chest because it&#39;s really smooth,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither,&#34;he states &#34;I&#39;m not as hairy as some men thank god and if I did I&#39;d wax it,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;m lazy and waxing would last longer,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As if you know that,&#34; I said smiling and rested my chin on his chest. He looked down at me and stroked my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it&#39;s common sense,&#34;he said &#34;but anyway would you prefer me to have a hairy chest?&#34; I screwed up my nose &#34;I&#39;ll take that as a no,&#34;he said chuckling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm you should,&#34; I said and rested my head on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Off to sleep now?&#34; he asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I said and moved my arms around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you cold?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I&#39;m ok, I have your body heat,&#34; I said snuggling into his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34;he said and reached for the lamp and switched it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Night,&#34; I say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Night,&#34; he said and kissed my head and I fell asleep in his arms.</p>
