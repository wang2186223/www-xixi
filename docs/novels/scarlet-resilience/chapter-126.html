                <p>A small knock sounds at my office door. I look up from my laptop to see who it is. Stood in a pair of skinny navy jeans and a red vest top is Megan. I give her a small smile as I notice she looks upset. From what the staff have told me she hasn&#39;t slept the past two days. Apparently, she&#39;s been in the games room all night playing different games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; I ask. She shrugs and sits in the chair in front of my desk. &#34;I got everything we need to get my uncle off our backs,&#34; I state. &#34;Do you want to see?&#34; I ask. She shakes her head and pulls her legs up so her knees sit just under her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I stay in here?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah sure, I&#39;m just answering a few emails,&#34; I answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; she says resting her head on her knees and wrapping her arms around her knees. I watch as her eyes close heavily and then open to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you speak to Melanie?&#34; I ask her. It has been two days since Melanie kissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No not yet, I tried to but she is avoiding me,&#34; she pauses &#34;I don&#39;t know what to do about her, I&#39;m not exactly angry at her, I just want to know what she&#39;s thinking,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;ll come see you when she&#39;s ready, Carl did the same thing with me, the first time he tried to kiss me,&#34; I say to her showing her I understand her dilemma at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes pass by and I&#39;ve answered three out of the ten emails I need to answer. I look up from my computer screen to Megan, to see she&#39;s asleep. I smile a little and stand up to put the blanket that&#39;s on the couch over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Miss Wright asleep?&#34; I hear David ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She hasn&#39;t slept for the past two days, she was looking for you last night and the night before,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I was forced into a conference call last night and the night before I can&#39;t even remember,&#34; I say rubbing my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what drugs do to you,&#34; he states and I look up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I found them, Logan,&#34; he says cutting me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t have any, I had weed instead,&#34; I argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; he says &#34;I have sorted everything out for your return back to America, my wife took the news better than I expected she&#39;s actually very excited to be going,&#34; he states and I smile a I knew that if she wasn&#39;t on board he wouldn&#39;t be returning with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And your children?&#34; I ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They don&#39;t seem too bothered with them both been in university they&#39;re happy to spend their summers in America,&#34; he answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, I&#39;m sure they will enjoy it,&#34; I say and look towards Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes I feel so helpless when it comes to her. Everything I do seems to be wrong, I want nothing more than to make her happy but I know I&#39;m failing. I&#39;m constantly worried about her. Worried that one day I&#39;ll wake up and she won&#39;t be here, that she has left me or worse taken her own life. It&#39;s hard at the moment not been able to hold her when she needs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;ll be ok,&#34; David says getting my attention. I look at him and he gives me a reassuring smile. &#34;I&#39;m more worried about you,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ok, I just feel helpless most of the time and I don&#39;t like it, I want to help her but I don&#39;t know how, sometimes I feel like I&#39;m making her worse,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sometimes things have to get worse for them to get better,&#34; he replies to me and I look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that your quote of the day,&#34; I ask jokingly to him. He smiles and shakes his head at me as he walks out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking towards Megan, I kneel down in front of her and move her hair out of her face. She looks so peaceful when she sleeps, it&#39;s my favourite of her looks. Moving my arm under her legs and then the other to her back I slowly pick her up. She stirs and moves her arms around my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t leave me alone,&#34; she says as she rests her head on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never,&#34; I say and lay her on the couch and she pulls me down with her. I smile and move down the side of her, she lets go and turns on her side so we&#39;re now spooning. &#34;Better?&#34; I ask. She nods and moves her hands to my arms that are around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When we go back home I want to be home-schooled,&#34; she suddenly says. I frown and sit up to look down at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With Benjamin out on the loose I think I&#39;d feel safer at home,&#34; she states not looking at me. I sigh and lay back down. Having this conversation now isn&#39;t the best time, we both need some sleep and if I&#39;m honest with myself I don&#39;t really see it being a bad idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;s what you want I&#39;ll arrange it,&#34; I say moving my arms back around her. She turns and looks at me. A smile clear on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; she says and kisses me on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Although,&#34; I say while pulling away, &#34;it will have to be an ugly old man or a female one,&#34; I joke. &#34;You know with teachers being your type,&#34; I joke and she giggles and pulls me on top of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you&#39;ll find I only have eyes for one person in my life,&#34; she states causing me to smile as I kiss her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, I get jealous very easily,&#34; I explain against her lips and then kiss down her neck, she relaxes in my arms and runs her hands through my hair. I pull away and look at her and smooth her hair from her face as I admire her beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The yellow flecks in her eyes just make her eyes glow, she has a small smattering of freckles over the top of her nose, only small, unnoticeable unless you&#39;re this close to her. Her whole body is pressed against mine, every inch of her is just perfect in my eyes. Looking at her I wonder if she will ever see herself the way I see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; she asks with a tilt of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; I say with a small smile and kiss her cheek. &#34;You should get some rest,&#34; I state as I lay at the side of her. She sits up to let me lay down on my back to have her lay her head on my chest.</p>
