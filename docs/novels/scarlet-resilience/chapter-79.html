                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was just great she&#39;s only just getting on track and this happens it&#39;s like she can&#39;t get a break. Did her grandfather not understand how much this would affect her now? He looks at me and bites his lip, his fiancé nudges him and he sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They have a right to know,&#34; she said to him. I look at them expecting them to now tell me. Megan&#39;s grandfather sighs and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s already out of the hospital, he&#39;s staying here at the moment but only because we haven&#39;t finished doing the pool house for him,&#34; her grandfather says. I sigh and shake my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So he&#39;s here now?&#34; I ask and he nods &#34;I&#39;ll tell Megan,&#34; I said looking at him. He nods and I stand &#34;What&#39;s his state of mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Benjamin is still the dominant personality not as much as before though which is good,&#34; he said as if that&#39;s the best news in the world. I shake my head and walk out of the sitting room. It is like he doesn&#39;t understand the seriousness of this and how much it is going to affect Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stand at the bottom of the stairs and take a deep breath. I really did not want to tell her that her father is already out of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I call &#34;come on we&#39;re going,&#34; I say. I figure she&#39;s in her room but I get no answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart felt like it wanted to jump out of my chest. The feeling of it pounding against my ribs hurt. My mouth dried and nausea built in my stomach as my eyes fix on him. I can feel my body over heat and the sweat slowly move down the side of my forehead. I hear Logan&#39;s voice call my name, I want to call back to him that I&#39;m in here in fact I want to get up and  run for my life to him but my body won&#39;t move. No part of my body will move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch him shut the door and his right hand move to the lock. I take a deep breath and mentally scream to myself to get up and run. He doesn&#39;t lock the door though he takes his hand away from it and looks down at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want a drink?&#34; he asks and moves away from the door to the bar. I shake my head once he looks at me. He takes a glass and pours himself some brandy with ice and then walks towards me. My body is</p>
                
                
                
                <p>suddenly able to move and I move back until I am at the other side of the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I missed you Megs,&#34; he said and sits down on the couch. I did not miss him or what he just called me. &#34;Have you missed me?&#34; he asks. I don&#39;t respond so he looks at me &#34;Have you?&#34; he asks. I shake my head and he glares at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; Logan calls and I close my eyes and feel my lips twitch to move and tell him I&#39;m in here but they don&#39;t move and it is now I wish I had some sort of mind communication power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is that?&#34; he asks almost in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...I,&#34; I start to stutter my mouth felt so dry and my mind has gone blank. Why can&#39;t I speak or do anything? He&#39;s going to get angry at me I can see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s him isn&#39;t it,&#34; he growls. I nod and he clenches his free hand into a fist &#34;You and him?&#34; he asks and I shake my head &#34;don&#39;t lie,&#34; he hisses and I gulp and feel my eyes start to water. I quickly nod &#34;Do you love him?&#34; he asks. I shake my head and he smiles and I feel this sense of relief &#34;They kept telling me you didn&#39;t love me but this proves them wrong,&#34; he said and moves closer to me. I gulp and move back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Proves them very wrong,&#34; he said and places his hand on my leg. I flinch and move my leg trying to move out of his grip but it was no use his hand was latched on like a claw. &#34;Doesn&#39;t it?&#34; he asks looking at me with hopeful eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I said, suddenly finding my voice. &#34;I don&#39;t love you, I never have, I loved my father but never you,&#34; I said looking at him. &#34;You&#39;re not my father and I have never and will never love you,&#34; and after I said that to him it is like I suddenly have strength. I push his hand of my leg and stand up &#34;I actually hate you more than you can ever imagine,&#34; I said to him and walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have no idea where this sudden burst of strength and courage came from, maybe it&#39;s the fact I&#39;m sick of being scared or his play toy to just have my every thought controlled by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open the door and as I do a hand slams it back shut and then locks it. I turn to look at him his face centimetres from mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll make you love me,&#34; he hisses at me. I raise an eyebrow at him and he leans in to kiss me. I turn my head and push him away but it doesn&#39;t work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands moving down my body squeezing in places they shouldn&#39;t be. I knee him in the groin and he drops to the floor letting me out of his grasp. I move away from him and move to the other door. I feel him grab my ankle before I get to the door and drag me back making me fall flat down on my face banging my nose on the floor and making it bleed. I place my hand on my nose and look at my hand to see if I am actually bleeding and I am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now stay,&#34; he snaps as he pins me down by my hands. This wasn&#39;t the first time I have fought him but it is going to be the first time I am going to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I call going up the stairs to Megan&#39;s room. I open the door to see she isn&#39;t there, I sigh and shut her door and check the other rooms. After a few minutes I hear a door slam shut from downstairs and then a thud and a small scream. I walks down the stairs and look around.,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; I hear her grandfather say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t find her,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you drop something or slam a door?&#34; he asks. I shake my head and he frowns &#34;Have you checked the game rooms?&#34; he asks. I nod and follow him to the kitchen. &#34;Phone her,&#34; he said and I took my phone out of my pocket and it&#39;s then I remembered she had left it at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She hasn&#39;t got her phone on her,&#34; I said and he looks at me and starts to pour himself a coffee. He looks at his cook and gives him a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your son went into the poker room,&#34; he said to him and he sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was supposed to stay in his room,&#34; he said and goes to open a door but it&#39;s locked. I frown at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think he dropped something in there as well,&#34; his cook says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there another way into that room?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes under the stairs,&#34; her grandfather says. I get up from my seat and walk to the stairs and then see a door. I try the door but it&#39;s locked. Something wasn&#39;t right. This was the only room I had come to that was locked. His bedroom wasn&#39;t even locked so why this one was I didn&#39;t know but I wanted to find out.</p>
