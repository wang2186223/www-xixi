                <p>Her body felt so good in my hands. She was fast asleep but I had been up for nearly an hour just watching her. I was back at work today and she had a two hour long session with the psychologist today which meant she wouldn&#39;t be in the best of moods. She hadn&#39;t had a nightmare once since I started sleeping in her bed with her or at least I don&#39;t think she had. Carl had told me he heard her downstairs the other night and when I questioned her about it she said she went down for a drink. Carl seemed ok with us going out; he just told me to make sure I was treating her how she should be treated and not to screw up. He had also told me I would have to tell her everything soon or the longer I leave it the more it will hurt her. In a way I knew he was right but in all honesty I was petrified with what she would do if I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan stop staring at me,&#34; she said sleepily &#34;it&#39;s scary,&#34; I smiled and kissed her on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; I said when I pulled away. She smiled and hugged me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; she replied, still with her eyes closed. &#34;You&#39;re back at work today aren&#39;t you?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but I will be able to pick you up,&#34; she sighs as I said that and pulled back from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to go,&#34; she groaned and stretched while yawning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but you have to,&#34; I said and moved my hand on her stomach. &#34;I don&#39;t really want to leave you right now but I have to,&#34; she looked at me as I said that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll come with you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you will go back to sleep and I will ring you at 11 to wake you up,&#34; I said and gave her a quick kiss and got out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What time is it?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seven AM,&#34; I say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urgh,&#34; she said groaning and turned on her stomach while pulling the covers off her showing her pyjama top. Her hands moved over head and she looked at me and smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be back in a bit,&#34; I said and walked out of her room to my own. I got a shower and then got changed into a pair of tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt. Once I was done I took my lip piercings out and then walked back to Megan&#39;s room to see her back to sleep. I smirked and sat down on her bed. Her eyes opened and she looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you not in your usual gear?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of my leg, it&#39;s hard for me to walk as it is, I need to be comfortable,&#34; I said and leaned in to kiss her on the lips. &#34;I need to go now, I have a meeting at eight,&#34; I paused and laid down at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So why did you get up so early?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I need to be there on time,&#34; I said and looked at her to see her looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aww you took them out, stupid school rules,&#34; she huffed. I smirked and moved an arm around her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you have a nightmare last night?&#34; I ask . She shook her head &#34;What about before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I haven&#39;t had one for a while which is a relief,&#34; she said and then paused &#34;I&#39;ll probably have one tonight though,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I said and leaned in for a kiss. After about fifteen minutes she was now out of bed and sat on her covers in front of me. &#34;Now I have to go,&#34; I say. I had been trying to go ten minutes ago but she didn&#39;t want to let me. She sighed and pouted. I smirked &#34;Sorry, if I could stay in bed all day, trust me I would but I can&#39;t now bye,&#34; I said and went to give her a kiss but she turned her head so I got the cheek. &#34;Charming,&#34; I said and pulled away from her. She stuck her tongue out at me as I stood straight and then smiled. I smiled back at her and walked out of her bedroom shutting the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervous isn&#39;t what would sum up my feelings right at this moment, I was more uneasy; I didn&#39;t know what to expect when I walked into the meeting room. For all I knew I could get a load of shit or nothing at all. Silence would probably be the worst thing as it would make me on edge and cause me to become nervous. I moved my hand to the handle and turned it counter clockwise and then opened it. The room fell silent as they turned to see who had entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Peters,&#34; The headmistress said with a delighted tone in her voice and a smile on her face. I gave her a small smile and sat down in the only seat available which was between the science teacher that I was sure had a thing for me and the very strict history teacher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I&#39;m late,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better, tired though,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is Megan doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Depends on the day,&#34; I state &#34;and the night she&#39;s had, if she&#39;s had a nightmare you can guarantee she&#39;ll be on edge all day,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if she hasn&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s tired, because the only way she thinks she won&#39;t have a nightmare is if she doesn&#39;t sleep,&#34; I said and cleared my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is your leg, is it better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t put all my weight on it and I&#39;m not supposed to do any sports for a while and I&#39;m on painkillers,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; she said &#34;in a way it&#39;s a good thing Megan doesn&#39;t start until next week because I am guessing there are a few precautions we will need to take with her?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just what you&#39;d expect really, don&#39;t get too close to her don&#39;t stand behind her or stand over her and try not to shout,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there anything we should be weary of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her, what you&#39;d probably call &#39;episodes&#39; it&#39;s rare but she can become confused and it&#39;s almost a black out but she&#39;s awake. Her mind forgets she&#39;s not with her father anymore and she tends to start screaming as if he&#39;s in the room with her and it may seem she&#39;s looking at you or someone but what she&#39;s seeing isn&#39;t you it&#39;s her father and well there&#39;s a sedative that I have been shown how to administer that she can have. There is a slight problem though as once it wears off she can become like that again which can be very troublesome, but I highly doubt anything like that will happen, she hasn&#39;t had one for a while. All in all just keep your distance and she should be fine,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok good, so now onto the agenda for this week,&#34; she started. I sigh a little and move my hand to my leg and rub it a little. The pain was back, that was just great.</p>
