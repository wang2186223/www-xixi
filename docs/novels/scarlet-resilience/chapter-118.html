                <p>\*\*Megan\*\*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk out of the bathroom to see Brendon sat on the bed. He looks up from his phone at me and his light brown eyes scanning my body. I automatically pull the towel tighter around my body and he looks back down at his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s brought you to my room?&#34; I ask him as I walk towards the walk in wardrobe. The long soak I took in the bath had cleared my mind of a few things. I know that last night I was being pathetic, a few years ago a guy dumping me would have just made me shrug my shoulders and forget about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to make sure you&#39;re ok,&#34; I hear him say. &#34;You know considering,&#34; he adds. I sigh and take a pair of bottoms out of my already packed bag and a vest top. I quickly get dressed and then walk out to join him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Considering I tried to kill myself over getting dumped,&#34; I say sitting on the bed and moving one leg onto it so I&#39;m facing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he says looking at me. &#34;How do you feel now?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I&#39;m the most pathetic person in the world,&#34; I say and look down &#34;I&#39;m sick of feeling like this,&#34; I say and move my hands through my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which is what?&#34; he asks now mirroring my seating position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Empty,&#34; I answer and my voice barely comes out above a whisper.I feel the tear leave my eye and I wipe my cheek before it can go down my cheek. &#34;And I&#39;m sick of crying, I feel like he&#39;s done this on purpose, I feel really trapped right now and I don&#39;t like it,&#34; I say and look at Brendan to see him take a deep breath and then let it out slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here,&#34; he says and pulls my close to him by my legs. I climb into his lap and wrap my arms around his waist. &#34;I don&#39;t understand why he broke up with you, all I know is that he was stupid to,&#34; he says wrapping his arms around my body and I nuzzle into his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; I say with a small smile.  &#34;No one has seen him since he got back from wherever he was,&#34; he says to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was in hospital, he apparently drank too much last night,&#34; I say and I feel him hold me tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;God you&#39;re both trainwrecks,&#34; he says and I laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has no reason to be upset he&#39;s the one that broke up with me, he was probably celebrating the fact we broke up,&#34; I say and he look down at me and makes me look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t think like that, you have to ask yourself what could have caused him to end a relationship he has been fighting for,&#34; he explains and I look down. &#34;There&#39;s more to the story to me,&#34; he pauses &#34;and you need to find out what it is,&#34; he adds and I frown and look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you saying this to me?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t like the fact you&#39;re upset, he probably didn&#39;t realise how much of an impact him breaking up with you would have,&#34; he says and then yawns. &#34;I need to sleep,&#34; he says and leans back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep in here with me,&#34; I say and he looks at me and sits up fully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, just don&#39;t touch me,&#34; he says pointing his finger at me. I laugh and get into bed. He gets in next to me and I turn the TV on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why haven&#39;t you been sleeping?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have, I just got very drunk last night and stayed up most of the night, I only went to bed at like 7am,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you sleep I&#39;m watching a movie,&#34; I say and turn to the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s weird as soon as I saw Brendan I thought he was here to try it on with me or make some sort of move. Mostly because I know how he feels for me. I know he likes me and it has surprised me what he suggested. The thing is after yesterday I don&#39;t think I can be with Logan if there was another reason. He is the one that decided to break up with me and I hate the thought of being that dependent on him. On anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint sound of my door shutting woke me from my sleep. I yawn and stretch out a little but I feel legs next to mine. I open my eyes with a frown creasing my face. I just heard Brendan leave. I look to see he hasn&#39;t left at all, he&#39;s still asleep next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clock next to the bed tells me that it&#39;s just past 3am. It doesn&#39;t surprise me when I hardly slept last night. The fact Logan was in hospital made me worry, seeing him so lifeless in Carl&#39;s and David&#39;s arms just scared me. I want to know if he&#39;s ok now but at the same time I don&#39;t want to see him. Seeing him will just make me question why he has done what he&#39;s done and the last thing I need is another argument with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I climb out of bed and make my way out of the bedroom and downstairs to the kitchen. I haven&#39;t eaten all day and I can feel just how hungry I am. I make myself a nutella sandwich and grab a packet of chips that I have learnt through watching british TV are called crisps. Which I can understand why and chips are different over here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Squeezing the nutella from my second half of my sandwich I hear the front door open and then shut. People seem to always be coming and going in this mansion. I know Carl was planning to go out tonight, whether he did or not I don&#39;t know. I lick the nutella from my sandwich and then bite it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I hear someone say. I look up from my plate to see Logan stood at the door of the kitchen. He&#39;s wearing dark grey bottoms and a white t-shirt that hugged hi muscles perfectly. I wet my lip remembering just how it felt to touch those muscles. His hair looks like he&#39;s ran his hands through it way too many times. His usually bright blue eyes look dark and tired. &#34;Sorry I just saw the light on,&#34; he says a moment after staring at me. I swallow my bite and place my sandwich down on the plate. He walks in and places something down on the counter and then walks towards the fridge. I look at what he placed which is a lighter and a cigarette packet. &#34;Can I sit with you?&#34; he asks now turning from the fridge to look at me. I sigh and stand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m finished anyway,&#34; I say, taking my plate to the sink and taking my chips with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, wait please,&#34; he says, walking out after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I snap and turn to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to talk to you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What more do you need to say to me,&#34; I snap &#34;You said enough the other day,&#34; I say and walk away from him. I just make it to the bottom of the stairs when I feel him take me by my elbow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; he begs. &#34;I just want to tell you something,&#34; he says. I sigh and fold my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on then,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not here,&#34; he says and starts to walk off to the left. I frown and hesitate on going with him. There&#39;s nothing he really needs to tell me, we&#39;re broken up what else could he possibly have to say to me. &#34;Megan please,&#34; he says turning to look at me. &#34;If you don&#39;t want to be near me after what I tell you then I&#39;ll leave you alone,&#34; he says. I can&#39;t really argue with that. I follow him down the hall.</p>
