                <p>&#34;Logan, are you really going to eat a desert?&#34; I ask him. He smiles and tilts his head at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I really need to answer that question?&#34; he asks. I shake my head with a small smile and finish off my second glass of wine. &#34;Do you want to get some air while they&#39;re preparing my dessert,&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; I say and watch as he stands. He reaches out for my hand and I gently put my hand in his as I rise from my seat. He looks towards our waiter who is standing a few feet from our table and tells him to call us when our dessert has arrived. Logan leads me out of double doors that lead out onto a balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look around and notice there were a few other couples dotted around the balcony and a man playing the violin. Logan moves his arms around me as I lean against the rail of the balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So have you enjoyed today?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I have actually,&#34; I pause and look up at the night sky &#34;for some reason I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d enjoy it as much as I have,&#34; I say and then look at him. &#34;I&#39;m not used to been spoiled,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will have to get used to it, you deserve to be spoiled,&#34; he says with a small smile and kisses my shoulder. I smile and move my hand onto his chest. He moves in and kisses me on the lips. &#34;Do you want our dessert out here or inside?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm how about up in our room?&#34; I ask shyly. He smiles a little and kisses me on the lips once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That can be arranged,&#34; he says and holds me tightly to him. He then turns towards the waiter that had been serving us all night. &#34;Can we have our desert brought up to our room?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely sir,&#34; he pauses &#34;I will have it brought to your room once it is done,&#34; he says and walks away from us. Logan takes my hand in his and pulls me with him towards the doors that lead back into the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we reach our table he picks up my jacket and helps me put it on. We walk out of the restaurant into the lobby of the hotel. He leads me towards one of the elevator and presses for it to come. Logan lets go of me hand and pulls out his wallet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know if I should tip our waiter or not,&#34; he suddenly says. I look up at him &#34;I pay his wage anyway so I don&#39;t know,&#34; he says taking out a card. &#34;Plus he has hardly done anything special,&#34; he points out &#34;to say I own this hotel you think he would do something special,&#34; he says and looks up at the ceiling in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you expect him to do?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crack a joke do a few hand stands, spin on his head you know what jesters would do for their kings,&#34; he says. I raise my eyebrows at him and he turns to look at me with a smile on his face. &#34;I&#39;m kidding I usually tip though,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tip him when he brings the deserts up if you&#39;re that bothered, I personally don&#39;t think he earned a tip,&#34; I pause &#34;you&#39;re right he did nothing special, didn&#39;t go out of his way to make our evening a pleasant one, I&#39;d fire him,&#34; I state. He looks at me &#34;I&#39;m serious,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll fire him tomorrow then,&#34; he says and I laugh. The elevator doors open. I walk in and he walks in after me. The doors close and Logan presses the top floor button. He moves his arms around me and moves a piece of my hair to the side and behind my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He might be having an off day,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True, I really don&#39;t care though,&#34; he says as he leans towards me &#34;not right now anyway,&#34; he adds and kisses me.  I smile and kiss him back. His hands move through my hair and push me closer to him as I clench his shirt in my hands. He pulls back and then starts to kiss my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I say trying to get his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he says between kisses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a camera,&#34; I say staring up at the camera. He stops and he lets out a small chuckle and looks in the direction I&#39;m looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; he says taking hands from around me. I let go of his shirt and he takes my hand into his. &#34;Not comfortable with an audience?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m comfortable with them, when I know who&#39;s watching,&#34; I say and he looks at me.  I give him a small smile and kiss his cheek. The elevator stops and we walk out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re an exhibitionist,&#34; he says to me as we walk to our room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I used to be, to a certain extent,&#34; I say and stop when he stops. He takes a card out of his trouser pocket and places it into the door handle. The door beeps and then unlocks. I watch him open it and then walk inside, I walk in after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room is bigger than I expected. It has a sitting area with a flat screen TV mounted onto the wall and a corner brown couch. Logan takes off his blazer as he walks up the two steps into the living room and throws it onto the couch. I follow and take my blazer off but I hold mine as I look around to see that this was open plan as the bedroom were only two steps higher than the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to make a phone call, make yourself at home ok,&#34; he states and open the balcony doors from the bedroom and walks out onto a terrace shutting the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I often wonder what goes through his mind when he&#39;s alone with me. He always seems to have an excuse to be out of the room with me. It&#39;s different when we&#39;re about to go to bed, maybe he senses that I feel a bit awkward. I do feel tense right now, only because I feel like he&#39;s expecting something to happen right now. I don&#39;t understand why I feel this way when I&#39;ve been alone with him plenty of times. Maybe it&#39;s because I want something to happen and I&#39;m expecting it myself not him. I place my jacket on the couch and slip off my shoes and as I do the doors open again and Logan walks in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No answer,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who were you trying to call?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl, but knowing him he&#39;s most likely out or sleeping, he was talking about a rave he wanted to go to before,&#34; he says. I smile a little trying to imagine Carl in rave gear. &#34;I know what you&#39;re thinking and he looks hilarious and also is hilarious when he goes to raves, it&#39;s like his real gay side comes out,&#34; he says. &#34;But then again it depends what he&#39;s taken,&#34; he says after a long pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drugs can do funny things to a person,&#34; I say and walk up to him and wrap my arms around his waist. I wonder if I make the first move I might relax a little. Or if I can stop myself from thinking about all of this I can relax and just allow things to happen. I feel like I&#39;m acting like I&#39;ve never done anything with a guy before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now what is your plan Miss Wright now that you have me in this hotel room?&#34; he asks suddenly. I look up at him and I realise what he&#39;s trying to do. He&#39;s trying to make me make the first move. Or he&#39;s trying to relax me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I plan on eating dessert with you but it&#39;s not here yet,&#34; I say and he smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you know what that means don&#39;t you?&#34; he asks and moves his hands to cup my face. &#34;That you are at a conundrum, that is until the dessert does arrive and knowing the French they may take a while what with them wanting to be perfect with me being their boss and everything,&#34; he says with a smirk creasing his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I guess you have to entertain me until dessert comes,&#34; I say. He smiles and leans in to kiss me. I move my hands up his body and pull him closer to me. He moves his hands from my face down my body to my hips. He pulls back and kisses my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no camera&#39;s in here,&#34; he whispers in my ear. I giggle and sit down on the bed. I move back on the bed and take his hand in mine pulling him on top of me. Our lips meet once more and I start to unbutton his shirt.</p>
