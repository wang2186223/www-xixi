                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I only stop once I&#39;ve left school, and I&#39;m a couple of blocks away. It&#39;s only then I realise I left my bag and there&#39;s no security around me. I laugh and sit down on a bench. It seems I&#39;m more scared of my emotions for Logan then I am of Jonathon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing I look up at the sky to see it&#39;s completely clear of any clouds, there&#39;s not even a plane in sight. I wish everything were as clear as this sky. The sun beats down on me, and it&#39;s warm and comforting. I feel my tears dry on my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I should see my therapist. Then I remember I don&#39;t have my phone. I open my eyes and look around and notice there&#39;s a sign for the cemetery and it&#39;s not that far away. It&#39;s been a long time since I saw my mom. I stand and make my way to the cemetery, following the signs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about 10 minutes, I&#39;m standing in front of my mother&#39;s grave. Her name mocks me in gold leaf. She&#39;d be disappointed in me. I know she would because I am. I feel myself get angry, if she were still here, I wouldn&#39;t be like this, but then I remember all of this is my own doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, I need you,&#34; I say quietly, and her name blurs as my eyes fill with tears. I shake my head and look up at the crystal clear blue sky. I sigh and try to calm down as I close my eyes as I realise it&#39;s not her I need. &#34;I need help,&#34; I say quietly and look at her black marble gravestone. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ve been so stupid,&#34; I smile, knowing what she&#39;d call me. &#34;I&#39;ve been a dumb-dumb,&#34; I say. &#34;I don&#39;t even know how to fix any of this,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t forgive me if I were him, how do I even tell him?&#34; I pause and take a shaky breath as I feel the tears drop. &#34;How do I tell him I love him?&#34; I ask, and I know I&#39;m not going to get an answer. I probably wouldn&#39;t get a response if she was alive. She&#39;d probably tell me that&#39;s something I have to figure out myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just so angry, all the time,&#34; I sigh and sit on the bench that is right in front of her grave. I notice there&#39;s a fresh set of roses laid on the ground. I get up and pick them up to read the card with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;m sorry, B x&#39; is all it says, and I know it&#39;s from Brett. I smile a little and place them back down. I wonder what he&#39;s sorry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of hours passed, I didn&#39;t even realise I had been here that long. I only knew because the sun was a lot higher in the sky now. I look around and see an old guy with his dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me,&#34; I call. He turns and looks at me. &#34;Can you tell me the time please?&#34; I ask. He looks at his watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just gone 12:30,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; I say and turn back to my mother&#39;s grave. I&#39;ve been here for about three hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have just zoned out thinking about her and everything she would say to me. I can only imagine her sitting here talking to me, telling me she loves me, but she hates the things I&#39;ve done. What I&#39;d done to Logan, and probably the stupid tattoo I&#39;ve got on my hip, that I got about two weeks ago. It&#39;s only a small outline of a heart, but she&#39;d hate it because it means nothing. I got it while drunk at a party. I mean I could have got something a lot worse but still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not that bad,&#34; I say quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And neither is this situation you&#39;re in,&#34; my vision of her says. I smile and tilt my head. I look at her gravestone. &#34;Just tell him,&#34; I smile and stand up. I kiss the tip of my fingers and press my hand to her headstone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll come back and tell you how it goes,&#34; I say quietly and walk away from her grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I&#39;m out of the cemetery, I yawn and stretch, and I decide I&#39;m going to tell him, and if he doesn&#39;t forgive me, that&#39;s something I&#39;m going to have to deal with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A black van speeds down the road, I step back so it doesn&#39;t hit me and glare at it and then it stops a few feet from me. Then it reverses and stops in front of me. The side door opens, two men in black ski masks jump out. I look around to see there&#39;s no one on the street. I step back as then walk towards me. I turn and run as fast as I can back into the cemetery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear them behind me pounding the pavement, and I curse the boots I&#39;m wearing, they only have a small heel, making it challenging to run. They shout at me, but I ignore them as I turn onto the grass to weave my way through gravestones. There&#39;s an exit at the other side of the cemetery, but this cemetery is massive. I look behind me to see they both split up. My eyes widen when I notice one has a gun in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell? Who are these guys?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I change direction and beg my legs to go faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s going for the exit,&#34; one shouts to the other. I then see; roughly 100 meters away from me; the guy that had broken away from his partner go past me to the exit. I stop to run towards the man behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David had told me that if I was ever being chased, the best thing to do was to run away for so long then turn and run towards them at full speed because they won&#39;t expect it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sprint as fast as I can as I feel the adrenaline pumping through my body and I do what David calls a rugby tackle to the man. I pound into him with my shoulder right in the gut, knocking the wind right out of him. He drops to the ground, and I land on top of him and rollover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, what the fuck?&#34; the man groans. I get back onto my feet, but he&#39;s quicker. He grabs my foot and pulls me down. I kick him with my free foot in the head and then scramble away from him. I start running again and get to a collection of trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t have many options here. The van with the driver is blocking one of the exits, and the other is probably still blocking the other. I look from my hiding place to see they&#39;re both together again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ok?&#34; the one that I didn&#39;t tackle asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, he said this was going to be easy, she&#39;s just a teenage girl, just grab and run, he said,&#34; the one I hit says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;re kidnappers for hire. Great. Jonathan outdid himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and try my best to think of a way out of this. I count to three in my head and just decide to go for it. If I get out of the cemetery I can go to the cafe not far from here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running out from the trees, I hear them notice me. I look to see they&#39;re both running and it would seem they have upped their game because they&#39;re faster than before. One grabs for me, but I sidestep and unfortunately for me my foot lands in a hole, and I topple over. He lands on me, and I bring my fist up and punch him in the face and then knee him in the groin. Now he&#39;s either a ken doll or he&#39;s wearing a cup because he doesn&#39;t feel a thing. He goes to grab my wrists and pins them down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop fighting,&#34; he snaps. I say nothing and headbutt him in the face. He recoils from me and then punches me in the face, I see stars, but fortunately for me, that&#39;s not the first time someone has hit in the head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bring my legs up and push him in the chest with them, making him fall back. I get up and wipe the blood from my cheek as I get into a fighting stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get the needle ready,&#34; the one that punches me says. They both circle me, and I try my best not to panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We got told not to use that,&#34; the other says. I&#39;m going to call him kidnapper B as it seems the guy who hit me is the boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, the rules have changed. We also got told she was just a teenage girl,&#34; he states. While Kidnapper B takes a hard black case out of his pocket and opens it to take a needle out, Kidnapper A launches at me. I dodge his hit and bring my leg up to kick him in the head. I will do everything I can to make sure I don&#39;t end up in the hands of Jonathon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t we talk about this?&#34; I ask as I dodge another attack. &#34;Whatever he&#39;s paying you I can pay more,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doubt it, sweetie,&#34; Kidnapper B says, and he goes to attack me. I&#39;m screwed, I shouldn&#39;t think about it, but there&#39;s two of them and one of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Kidnapper B has hold of me by the waist. He lifts me and slams me down onto the ground, and my whole body shudders with pain. I let out a scream as my body collides with the grass. The only saving grace is that I know if I had hit the concrete, it would have hurt so much more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grab her,&#34; I hear Kidnapper A orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; I say as I try to get up and then a cloth comes over my mouth and nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Night night sweetie,&#34; Kidnapper B says to me, and I feel a sharp prick in my neck. Slowly my world turns dark. My last thought is that David better be damn proud I rugby tackled a 6&#39;6 man.</p>
