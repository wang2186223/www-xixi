                <p>She lays back a little and grinds her hips into me, meeting my thrusts. She feels goddamn perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I move my hands to her hips and lean forward to kiss her chest. Her hand moves through my hair, and she pulls me to kiss me on the lips. I tighten my grip on her and move my hands up her back, holding her to me as tight as I can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck,&#34; I groan as I feel her walls tighten around me and her hands move down my back. I love it when she scratches me, it&#39;s her own way of marking me, and it&#39;s hot as hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah Logan I&#39;m gonna come,&#34; she pants and lays down, I watch as her back arches away from my desk. She grips the edge of the desk above her head and throws her head back. I wet the tip of my fingers with my mouth and then massage her clit moving in tandem with my thrusts. I hold one of her legs which has moved up over my shoulder. Her flexibility may best me in the gym, but at times like this, it&#39;s the best thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch as she moves her head to the side and bites her shoulder as she tries to keep her moans in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone will hear,&#34; she pants and looks at me. I shake my head. I watch as her pleasure builds inside her. God, I love watching her orgasm, the little sounds she makes just before are the cutest and sexiest sounds I&#39;ve ever heard. Her tongue darts out to wet her lip as she asks me to go harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one will, there&#39;s a room between us and others,&#34; I ground out as I feel myself pushing at my orgasm. &#34;Plus lunchtime,&#34; I add and thrust hard into her. She moans loudly as she comes, and I didn&#39;t expect her to ejaculate, but she does. God, this girl is my undoing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her walls tighten around me, and I feel my own orgasm run through my body, and I come before I can pull out, that and her body holds onto me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a minute or so, her body relaxes as we both catch or breath. Leaning forward, I press a kiss on her lips. Slowly I move my lips against her and then pull back and push my forehead against her. I feel her hand move to my cheek as she gradually caresses me, looking me in the eyes, and again I feel like she&#39;s trying to tell me something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; I murmur, and press a light kiss to her lips. She gives me a small smile and then looks down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should get dressed,&#34; she says quietly. I nod and pull out of her. She shivers and then looks at me, and I could go again if we had the time and she knows it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moves off my desk, and I watch her stand on shaky legs before moving away from me. She reaches down for her jacket and then turns away from me as she buttons her dress up. I look down and tuck myself back into my boxers and zip my jeans back up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you want to talk about?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you got any tissues?&#34; she asks. I nod and take the paper towels from one of the shelves next to the art sink. I give her a handful, and I watch as she wipes the inside of her leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to do it inside,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, I want to break up,&#34; she says quickly and looks at me and then back at her leg to make sure it&#39;s clean. I frown as I take in what she just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I ask as I stop buttoning my shirt. I&#39;m not asking her to repeat herself. I&#39;m asking what is going on? What is making her say this? She looks away from me and wipes her cheeks. She looks the same as when she broke up with Tyler, and she didn&#39;t want to do that then. &#34;I don&#39;t understand,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing to understand. I want to break up,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just do,&#34; she says as she smooths down her dress. She moves a hand through her hair and then turns to look at me. &#34;I&#39;ve been thinking about what you said last night, and you were right,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck? What was this then? What was last night?&#34; I ask. I&#39;m confused by her actions. The way she just looked at me isn&#39;t the way someone would look if they were going to end a relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t make this harder Logan,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the look of things, it&#39;s easy as fucking pie for you,&#34; I snap. She sighs and picks up her bag, &#34;this makes no sense, have I done something wrong,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve already explained,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you haven&#39;t, you said you thought about what I said about last night, what conclusion did you come to?&#34; She bites her bottom lip and then looks away as a stray tear rolls down her cheek. I walk towards her and move my hand down her arms. &#34;Why do I get the feeling you don&#39;t want to do this?&#34; I ask softly and place my hand under her chin to make her look at me, and I see the tears in her emerald eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t do this anymore,&#34; she says quietly and moves her hands up my chest. &#34;Just please accept this,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I snap and hold her tighter. I pull her body against mine and press my lips to hers. She instantly kisses me back but then pulls away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan please,&#34; she cries and pushes me away from her. &#34;I don&#39;t want to be with you,&#34; she snaps when there&#39;s a knock at my door, and it opens. I look to see Mrs Kitson. She glances between Megan and I as Megan wipes her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;s true, why are you crying?&#34; I ask. She shakes her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to go,&#34; she says and pushes past Mrs Kitson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I call and go after her but stop when I see her run out of my art classroom. &#34;Dammit,&#34; I growl and kick one of the stools.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m guessing this was a bad time,&#34; she states and looks at me, taking in my appearance which gives a lot away, seen as my shirt is still unbuttoned and my belt unbuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, as she just broke up with me,&#34; I snap and shove my shirt inside my jeans as I walk back into my office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see,&#34; she says. &#34;This is awkward. Do you want me to come back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, what&#39;s wrong?&#34; I ask with a sigh while buttoning my shirt back up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Wilson has asked me to ask you to be at his charity concert,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Carl knows I would say no,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said that you would say that, so he told me to tell you he will make your life hell here and at home,&#34; she says with a grin. &#34;I like him, I might ask him if he wants a permanent job here,&#34; she says. &#34;And it&#39;s for a good cause, and I&#39;m sure you will enjoy it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll think about it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; she says, and then looks around. &#34;Do you want to talk about what just happened?&#34; she asks. Shaking my head, I walk to pick up all of the artwork on the floor. &#34;Maybe next time lock your door, I did say I&#39;d have to do something if a student catches you both,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah well, I doubt this will happen again,&#34; I say, placing everything back on my desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure this is just down to her emotions, maybe she just wants a bit of time,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, she didn&#39;t want to, but I feel that she&#39;s made her mind up regardless of how she feels,&#34; I state and I feel like I want to cry. &#34;Can I be alone, please?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, if you need to talk, let me know,&#34; she says and walks out. I sigh and sit in my chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave her my god damn heart, and she just crushed and trampled all over it in front of me, and I&#39;m pissed about it. All I&#39;ve done is love her, and she has just woken up and decided to end things. What have I done to deserve this?</p>
