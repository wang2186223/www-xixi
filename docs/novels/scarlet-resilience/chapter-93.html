                <p>Standing at the bathroom doorway as I brush my teeth I watch Logan start to get dressed. He pulls on his boxers and then turns to look at me. I smile a little and walk back into the bathroom to spit and rinse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were you perving on me?&#34; he asks now standing at the doorway. I smile and nod as I continue to brush my teeth. He looks down on himself &#34;actually I&#39;ll put on some shorts seen as we&#39;re off in the pool,&#34; he states and I frown and spit into the sink and then rinse my mouth again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? I&#39;m not going in the pool,&#34; I say and he smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to,&#34; he says and kisses my shoulder and then walks out. I sigh and rinse my toothbrush and place it in the cup provided and then walk back out. &#34;But you have to wear your bikini,&#34; he says and I frown. I sit on the bed and fold my arms. &#34;You can wear something over it,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh joyful,&#34; I say with a roll of my eyes and he walks into the wardrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got one of those long dresses that you can wear over it,&#34; he calls out to me. I stand and walk towards the wardrobe to see him holding my black maxi dress. &#34;Wear this over it,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess,&#34; I say quietly &#34;it doesn&#39;t cover my back fully though,&#34; I state and he sighs at me. &#34;Ok,&#34; I say and take the dress off him. &#34;Leave,&#34; I say and he walks past me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan moves his hand into mine as I walk down the stairs. I had decided on having my hair down to cover the part of my back that the dress didn&#39;t cover. I also resolved to putting some make up on. He leads me down the right corridor right to the end and then opens the door for me. I walk in to see a large rectangle swimming pool with loungers dotted around the pool along with a barbeque. The walls of the room are glass apart from the side we are stood at and at the top where there&#39;s another level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon babe there&#39;s really nothing to worry about your scars are covered and well none of them are remarkably beautiful like you,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urgh you&#39;re so cheesy,&#34; I say walking into the room and sitting on one of the loungers. He sits next to me and looks at me &#34;I&#39;m sorry it just annoys me,&#34; I say and he frowns at me &#34;cheese it annoys me,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah it&#39;s better with crackers,&#34; he says and I laugh. He smiles at me and leans in to kiss me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it&#39;s finally nice of you both to join us, and I see you have no problem with your bikini now,&#34; I hear Melanie say. I look to see her sat at the pool edge looking towards us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck off Melanie,&#34; Logan snaps. Melanie frowns and I look at Logan to see him glaring at her. He stands up &#34;heartless bitch,&#34; he says as he walks away from us making sure he was heard by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you actually going to let him talk to me like that?&#34; she asks and I sigh a little. &#34;Well I obviously know who comes first now don&#39;t I,&#34; she snaps and moves into the pool, I look towards Logan to see him dive into the pool and start to swim. I really don&#39;t want to get involved with them two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is being a bit of a bitch,&#34; I hear someone say. I look behind me to see Melanie&#39;s boyfriend Cade. I frown at him &#34;I may be her boyfriend but I&#39;m allowed an opinion on her and to be truthful once we get back to America I&#39;m dumping her,&#34; he says and my jaw drops a little &#34;she&#39;s being totally someone different since we&#39;ve been here and well I&#39;m not wasting my time with someone as vindictive as her,&#34; he says and sits on the lounger next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not that bad just hot headed,&#34; I say and he shakes his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No she has anger issues and likes to blame everyone else for her own mistakes, if she&#39;s not careful others will leave her not just me,&#34; he explains and looks down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess,&#34; I say and stand up. I lift my dress up and sit on the edge of the pool with my feet dangling in the water. Yasmin swims towards me and looks up at me with a small smile. &#34;Hey,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, did you sort everything out?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think so,&#34; I say with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two were gone for a while,&#34; she says and I smile</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We just took a bath and talked,&#34; I say and she laughs and leans on the pool edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We,&#34; she says with a wide smile. I roll my eyes at her and look towards Logan, he&#39;s stopped swimming and he&#39;s talking to Carl. His eyes land on me and a faint smile plays on his lips. &#34;Hmm do you think you and him will finally get it on?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yasmin you seem to want us to do it more than what I or him wants to?&#34; I say and she shakes her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one wants you to do it more than him,&#34; she says and I look down at her. &#34;He&#39;s a guy,&#34; she states in a matter-of-fact tone. I laugh a little and start to move my feet in the water. A hand reaches out a grasps my foot. I look to see it&#39;s Logan. He moves between my legs and takes my hand in his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you girls talking about?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sex,&#34; Yasmin says and I look at her. She smiles and looks at Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An interesting subject,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you prefer it?&#34; she asks him and he frowns and then looks at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that really what you&#39;re discussing about how you both prefer sex?&#34; he asks and she shakes her head. &#34;As delightful as this conversation is...&#34; he turns to look at me &#34;I would much rather discuss you coming into the pool,&#34; he says and I shake my head &#34;why?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know why,&#34; I state and he sighs and moves his hands outs of mine to my waist. &#34;Well I guess you can keep the dress on,&#34; he says and pulls me close to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Logan,&#34; I say pushing his hands off me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one cares,&#34; he says looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I care,&#34; I snap. He takes his hands from around my waist and gets out of the pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will see you tonight?&#34; he says. Sighing heavily I lift my feet out of the water. I glance at Yasmin and she gives an apologetic look. I smile a little and follow Logan out of the pool room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I call as I walk towards the stairs and see him heading up the stairs. He stops and looks at me. I give him a small smile and walk up the stairs to him. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For...?&#34; he asks and tilts his head a little. I look down at my feet, I&#39;m sorry for upsetting him but I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ve upset him. He moves his hand up to my face and gently brushes a piece of my hair behind my ear. &#34;There&#39;s no reason for you to be sorry,&#34; he says and trails his fingers down my neck. &#34;Come on,&#34; he says moving his hand down to mine and taking me with him towards our room.</p>
