                <p>Carl watches me as I finish off the bottle of vodka in my hand. I had told him over and over to go back as him being here isn&#39;t going to change anything. He knows that I will drink and take what I want until I pass out. A part of me is hoping that when I return tomorrow morning she has gone on the flight home. The other part of me hopes to hell she hasn&#39;t gone, that she is still back at the mansion so that if needed I can save our relationship. I only need to think of a way to get my uncle off my back so that I can redeem my relationship with Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan don&#39;t you think you&#39;ve had enough?&#34; Carl says moving up to me as I order another large bottle from the bartender. We were in one of the many clubs I own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No but I do think I need a piss,&#34; I say grabbing the bottle and walk off towards the mens toilets. I step inside and muffled music and voices now fill my ears. My left leg starts to vibrate. I frown and step back a little and reach in my pocket to take out my phone. Carl walks in behind me and takes the bottle out of my hand. I&#39;m not too bothered by that as I am at the number blinking on my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; I answer and stagger towards one of the cubicles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi is this Logan?&#34; as woman asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, who is this?&#34; I slur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Catherine, Megan&#39;s psychologist, I&#39;m sorry to bother you but I&#39;m really worried she will hurt herself or has by now seen as I&#39;ve been trying to get in contact with you for the past 30 minutes,&#34; she explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know?&#34; I ask frowning. Carl stands in front of me as I sit on a toilet with the lid down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is it?&#34; he mouths and I mouth back who it is. He takes the phone out of my hand and talks to her for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurt herself, why would Megan do that? Is it because of me, I never meant for her to be hurt or get hurt. This is just all out of control. I hold my head in hands. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m here when I&#39;ve just hurt her, how selfish can I be. She is the love of my life and I&#39;m acting like she means nothing to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, we&#39;ll ring someone there and get there as soon as we can,&#34; Carl says breaking through my thoughts. &#34;He&#39;s not great, he didn&#39;t want to do what he did it was due to some circumstances, he just can&#39;t tell Megan that,&#34; he says to her and it&#39;s then I know they&#39;re talking about me. &#34;I will let you know what has happened,&#34; he says and puts the phone down. He looks at me and hands the phone to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ring Yasmin,&#34; he orders &#34;Catherine said after speaking to Megan she isn&#39;t in the best frame of mind,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, lets go back,&#34; I say getting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry she&#39;ll be ok,&#34; he answers as I dial the number at the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\*\*Yasmin\*\*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I call. I had heard her leave her room about half an hour ago. I thought she&#39;d be back upstairs but I haven&#39;t heard her return. I really wish I hadn&#39;t left her. I kept my door open just so I could hear anything that was different. I get no reply from calling her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see the pregnant maid we had seen when we come here. She gives me a small smile and walks past me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me,&#34; I say getting her attention she stops and looks at me &#34;Have you seen Megan?&#34; I ask. She frowns at me &#34;The girl Logan goes out with,&#34; I say and the look on her face tells me she knows who I&#39;m on about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw her go in the far left study about twenty minutes ago,&#34; she informs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks I say and walk down the left corridor to the end. I open the large dark brown door and look inside to see a few lights were on. &#34;Megan,&#34; I say looking around and then see her sat on the black leather couch. Her back is towards me. &#34;C&#39;mon, the party is going to start soon, you don&#39;t want stay in here,&#34; I say walking towards her &#34;just forget about that shit head for&#34; I freeze as I see her or more accurately when I see blood. &#34;What have you done?&#34; I ask walking towards her. She looks up at me and I see the tear streaked face. She looks back down at her arm as she brings a small knife away from it showing another cut. &#34;Megan,&#34; I say taking the knife out of her hand and press my hands to her arm. &#34;Help,&#34; I call out. I take a deep breath and let go of her hand and run towards the door and scream for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man that follows Logan about is running towards me. He has a phone in his hand. He hands it to me and I frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s for you,&#34; he states &#34;what has happened?&#34; he ask as he notices my blood stained hands. I look at the phone and then back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, she&#39;s hurt herself,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, calm down,&#34; he says calmly and walks in the room. He walks towards Megan and lets out a small sigh before taking off his shirt and wrapping it around her arm tightly. He then lays her down and holds her arm up in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, the phone call,&#34; he says now looking at me. I look down and then nod. I had totally forgotten about the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yasmin what&#39;s happened?&#34; I hear Carls voice ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan she,&#34; I pause and close my eyes as I think about how to word the situation. I take a deep breath to calm my nerves and answer, &#34;Megan has self harmed,&#34; I say and look at her to see a blank stare covering her features. Redness rimming her emerald green eyes that now look glassy due to the tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck,&#34; he says in distress &#34;how bad?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s blood everywhere,&#34; I say as I feel myself getting upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re on our way home don&#39;t worry,&#34; he says &#34;just stay with her,&#34; he adds. &#34;Can you put David back on please?&#34; he asks. I hold the phone out to David. He holds Megan&#39;s arm to me and I take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep it elevated,&#34; he says to me and walks out with the phone. I hold her hand with both of my hands and look down at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I say looking down at her. Her eyes close and then open to look at me. She moves her arm out of my hands and sits up</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl is on his way home,&#34; I say to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan?&#34; she asks,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; I say. She sighs and stands but staggers back down onto the couch. &#34;Just stay sat,&#34; I say moving a piece of her hair behind her ear. David walks back in and looks at her, he places a glass of water on the side and checks her pupils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve called a paramedic so things will be fine,&#34; he says now looking at me. &#34;Don&#39;t worry,&#34; he says with a small smile. &#34;It&#39;s not too deep,&#34; he says and I sigh in relief. I look at Megan to see her looking at my hands that are covered in her blood. She then looks at her wrist and then back at my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she says quietly and then looks down at her lap. &#34;Logan is coming isn&#39;t he?&#34; she asks softly. I nod and I notice her eyes well with tears. &#34;I don&#39;t want to see him,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell him when he arrives,&#34; I say and lean forward to wipe fresh tears from her cheeks.</p>
