                <p>Logan slowly walked forward while holding the bar at each side of him for support. One step, two steps, three step and the steps kept on going. A smirk went across him face as he looked down at his feet. It had been two and a half weeks since Megan collapsed right in front of him, her heart stopping right in front of him. The worst moments of his life were right there at that moment. He could see right then and there what was now going to happen. He could see himself relapsing, quitting his job going back into a state of depression and anger and he could see history repeating itself all over again, him on the edge ready to take his own life, ready to end it all just like he was before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good you have made brilliant progress,&#34; his physiotherapist stated. &#34;You need to exercise your leg like you are but now try walking at least ten steps a day ok?&#34; she asked. Logan nodded and took the crutches. He hadn&#39;t used his wheelchair in over a week, he just used the crutches and he had come quite accustomed to using them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile crept along that handsome face of his as he reached the floor her room was on. He didn&#39;t have to worry about relapsing as about a minute after he saw her collapse in front of him. He stood watching the team of doctors and nurses try and make her heart beat again and they did and at that moment he felt everyone in the room let out a sigh of relief. At the moment she started breathing again was the moment he saw what he had to do. As long as she lived he knew he&#39;d be happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan had spent most of the two weeks arranging Stephanie&#39;s funeral, he had never thought he would see someone smile at picking out their own coffin, but he did when he saw Stephanie do it. He could see that he was doing the right thing even if it did hurt him to do it but if it made her smile what did his feelings matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctors had put Megan in a coma to stop her from opening her internal stitches and for her body to heal quicker. The doctors thought she would try and leave and originally wanted to put her in a drug induced coma but there were no parents or guardians to sign the documents. Now they had an eligible reason. Logan walked to her room and slowly opened the door to see Melanie, Yasmin and Julie all sat in her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; they all said together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave them a small smile and walked to the seat he always sat in. They all looked at each other then looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why were you there that night?&#34; Melanie finally said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She called me and asked me to come and help her,&#34; he simply said. Logan had finally agreed to talk to the police. They took a written statement from him and recorded his interview. He was surprised that he actually could remember everything once he started to say everything out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened when you got to her? Because in the time that you got to her house you could have rang an ambulance and police,&#34; Melanie stated &#34;it would have saved so much time and so much trouble you wouldn&#39;t have got shot and she wouldn&#39;t be here now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yasmin and Julie looked at Melanie to see the anger on her face. &#34;Also why didn&#39;t you say anything to the school when she told you what had been happening? You could have told them as she didn&#39;t make you promise not to and well it is your job to do so no matter what.&#34; She snarled angrily. Logan sighed and went to answer when Melanie continued &#34;Why didn&#39;t you just say something as soon as you thought something was wrong? This is your fault.&#34; She snapped, &#34;you shouldn&#39;t even be here.&#34; She mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie,&#34; Yasmin said quietly as if to say that was out of order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah maybe I should have said something but if you were a real friend that didn&#39;t want her getting hurt you would have said something even if she did make you promise not to,&#34; Logan said looking at her behind his hair &#34;you can carry on taking your anger out on me Melanie but I know and these two know you are angry with yourself more than anyone else,&#34; he retorted to her. &#34;We are all angry at ourselves, I wouldn&#39;t blame you if you were angry at me I&#39;m angry at myself but we can&#39;t change what has happened just be thankful she&#39;s ok,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok&#34; Melanie repeated &#34;does she look fucking ok she&#39;s in a coma and well I know my friend and I can bet anything that she is not ok in the head right now,&#34; she snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan&#39;s right,&#34; Yasmin said, cutting into the little argument Melanie was trying to start. They all looked at her &#34;I may have found out a little late but I could have phoned the police as soon as I found out or that day when her dad took her home from Julie&#39;s,&#34; she paused &#34;I don&#39;t think anyone can feel as bad as what you and Logan feel but we all knew and we all thought we were doing the right thing,&#34; she paused &#34;Megan made you and Tyler promise not to tell anyone there must of been something that she said to Mr Peters to make him not tell anyone, something big because a promise doesn&#39;t look like it would stop him from telling anyone if he&#39;s had a wife go through similar stuff.&#34; Yasmin looked at Logan and so did Melanie and Julie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She threatened to tell the school that I sexually harassed her,&#34; he mumbled. Their eyes widened and they looked at Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No freaking way,&#34; Yasmin said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a bitch,&#34; Julie said slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At the time I only had theories so really what I had to say wouldn&#39;t have stood up in a room with the board, the principal and her dad. I would have lost my job and then I wouldn&#39;t have been able to help her at all,&#34; he stated. &#34;But,&#34; he sighed &#34;that&#39;s not important, let&#39;s all just be happy that she&#39;s not with that arsehole that was her father,&#34; he said and rubbed his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nurse with strawberry blonde hair walked into the room. She smiled sweetly at everyone and then walked to Megan&#39;s bed. She put her hand to Megan&#39;s neck and placed her middle finger and marriage finger on her pulse and looked at her watch. After a minute or so she took her hand away and reached for Megan&#39;s hospital notes and wrote something down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The doctor will be waking her up shortly,&#34; she stated &#34;now her leg is healed and it seems her heart is recovering lovely. They may do an MRI to make sure everything else is ok,&#34; she said and put the board down. She then walked out to walk back a few seconds later with bags of cleared liquid and a bag of what seemed like mashed food. &#34;Plus her weight has gone up which also means less problems are going to happen and it also means she&#39;ll have more energy to have more visitors rather than just one,&#34; she said smiling at the girls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much did she weigh when she came in?&#34; asked Melanie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Around six stone which is really bad for her height, now she weighs about seven,&#34; the nurse smiled again and started to replace the empty bags that were hooked to a pole that came from Megan&#39;s bed. The nurse then replaced the empty bags with the full ones. She then walked out with the empty ones to return again a couple of seconds later with a needle kit. She grabbed a chair put on some gloves and started to take the drip from Megan&#39;s hand. After she finished taking the drip out of Megan&#39;s hand the nurse started to tap her hand looking for another vein to put a clean drip in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When she wakes up we&#39;ll probably try her with some solid food there will also be psychiatrist coming in for when we wake her up and a dietician as there may be a possibility she may be suffering from an eating disorder,&#34; the nurse paused and then looked at them &#34;which means she&#39;ll be having more therapy,&#34; the nurse shook her head slightly and moved hair from Megan&#39;s face. &#34;Well I&#39;ll be leaving,&#34; she sighed and walked out while taking her gloves off and dropping them in the bin near the door and then shut the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three girls looked at each other and then at Logan to see him take hold of her hand again. They watched as he squeezed her hand and then intertwined his fingers with hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When are you back at school?&#34; Yasmin asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not for a while, I need to have more Physio before I can go back and apparently counseling for my &#39;trauma&#39; of being shot. They think I have too much anger,&#34; he said and then moved his other hand through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do,&#34; Julie muttered and then looked at her friend, &#34;I still don&#39;t get why she wanted to see Jonathon,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah it confused me at first,&#34; Logan stated &#34;and then she told me why,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why then?&#34; Julie asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because she doesn&#39;t think anyone will want anything to do with her now she thinks she&#39;s no good,&#34; Logan answered and looked at them to see them sigh and then look at their friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan sighed for the millionth time that day. She had been awake for three days now and everyday she had a visit from police and social workers, she hated it. They stood in their suits asking her questions she really didn&#39;t want to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; the blonde woman said, now sitting at the side of her bed &#34;you do understand that how you have been treated is not how a parent should treat their children, right?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan moved her hand to her ribs. She wasn&#39;t laid in bed anymore; she was sat in a wheelchair waiting for someone to take her away from this room. She had been left alone in the room with the social workers and the police for two hours now and she hadn&#39;t said a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blonde sighed and rubbed her eyes &#34;Megan if you don&#39;t talk to us your father may get away with what he has done to you. Do you want that?&#34; the woman asked. Megan had heard the woman say this to her hundreds of times and it didn&#39;t make any difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan blinked and moved her head away from the woman and towards the door. She watched as the door slowly opened and in walked a tall silver haired man in an expensive suit. Megan&#39;s eyes widened as she watched the tall man shut the door and then walk over to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm excuse me sir-&#34; the man cut the blonde off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m her grandfather,&#34; he said and stood in front of Megan. He sighed and shook his head &#34;could you leave for a moment please,&#34; he stated. The blonde nodded and left with the police leaving the door open. &#34;It&#39;s been a while, hasn&#39;t it Princess?&#34; he asked. Megan gulped and looked away from him. The man sighed &#34;I&#39;ve arranged for you to come and live with me until you are eighteen and then you can do whatever you like,&#34; he stated and sat down in the chair next to her. &#34;I was going to let you have your own apartment but I don&#39;t think you are in any state to be living on your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; she asked slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is this teacher I have heard so much about?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out.&#34; She said coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Princess I am sorry for what I said about your mother, I was wrong...your mother was the best thing that had happened to my son,&#34; he stated and looked at Megan &#34;and I am sorry for what has been happening to you,&#34; Megan glared at him &#34;I did know about my son&#39;s condition and I did beg with him to get some help after your mom died because he had stopped taking his meds,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out,&#34; she snapped once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will come back later, I have some papers to sign and I will wait outside till you are willing to talk to me,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That won&#39;t happen,&#34; she said as she watched him walk out of her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After several minutes Logan came into her room and sat down in his usual chair. He frowned slightly as he looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; she said before he asked her. He sighed, &#34;Can you take me somewhere away from this room?&#34; she asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; he stated &#34;I want to take you to see someone anyway,&#34; he informed me and stood up and started to wheel her out of the room.</p>
