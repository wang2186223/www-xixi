                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat playing with my car keys as her grandfather placed a mug of tea in front of me. He sighs and sits down opposite me. &#34;Where is Megan now?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the car, she refused to come in,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh ok, I don&#39;t really blame her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to tell me what&#39;s happening with your son?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s simple really, they are going to see how he deals in jail for three months and if it doesn&#39;t work out they will try the alternative which is an institute that specialises with what he has,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But there is a chance they may do what happened last time, because last time he didn&#39;t do too well being sectioned so they let him stay at home with a carer who helped him through things and within a year he was back to his original self,&#34; Megan&#39;s grandfather explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and rub my eyes. &#34;So you&#39;re basically saying he&#39;s going to get away with sexual, physical, mental and verbal assault oh and attempted murder,&#34; I said as I looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well the people that are dealing with the case are taking into account he wasn&#39;t in his own mind frame throughout everything that happened, and I&#39;m not saying that is the right thing for them to do but it is true he wasn&#39;t,&#34; he sighs and looks down. &#34;He&#39;s trying to get them to see he doesn&#39;t want to plea insanity, he wants to plead not guilty so he will get a longer sentence,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s his other personality like?&#34; I ask , he looked at me surprised. &#34;I had to do an assignment on the condition he has a while ago and normally they have more than just two, so I&#39;m guessing he has another one maybe two,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The other is called Harry,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s Harry like? I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s an eight year old boy who cries a lot and attaches himself to the women Benjamin hates and he&#39;s scared of Benjamin which is weird,&#34; he paused.&#34; He&#39;s like the version of Jonathon&#39;s friend that was taken with him,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok then,&#34; I said and took a drink of my tea. &#34;What happened to Jonathon?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was taken at around the age of five with his best friend and the man that took him, beat him raped him and psychologically abused him and forced him at the age of eight to kill his friend,&#34; he paused &#34;the man that took him is now in prison for life rather than on the death penalty, that is the other reason as to why Jonathon may not stay long in jail because the man has sent death threats to him over the years,&#34; he  explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s his name?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marcus Deed,&#34;he said and I saw him clench his fists as he said it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m guessing it was hard for you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was so happy when we finally got him back but it wasn&#39;t him we got back it was James and Benjamin, there was no sign of Jonathon at all,&#34; he paused, &#34;and when we finally did get Jonathon it was even worse, he was so withdrawn from us. He looked at us as if he hated us which I don&#39;t blame him, it was our fault he had been taken in the first place,&#34; he explained &#34;all because we had money and originally Marcus had held them both for money and when we paid him the ransom he still didn&#39;t give him back. He had sent us a letter saying Jonathon was now Benjamin and was now his and there was nothing we could do about it,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did he name him Benjamin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marcus apparently had a son who was beaten to death called Benjamin and Jonathon resembled him,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow,&#34; I said, heaving out a heavy breath &#34;that some messed up shit,&#34; I said and looked out the window to see Megan was still in my car and it looked like she was asleep. I looked back at her grandfather to see  him watching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have feelings for her?&#34; he asks suddenly. My eyes widened and I quickly shook my head. He chuckled and leaned back &#34;sixty four years of age do you really think I haven&#39;t seen the look you give her in all my years of been alive,&#34;he states. I looked down and sighs and looked back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only feelings I have for your granddaughter is love like a brother. I see she has a little sister and nothing more,&#34; I state. He chuckled and stood up walking off into the other room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure you do,&#34; I heard him call. I sigh and look back out the window to see her moving a little. I smiled a little and looked down at my mug of tea taking a small sip of it. &#34;Where did she go on Sunday?&#34; he asked as he walked back in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She met up with a friend and was with him Sunday to Monday night,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Him?&#34; he asks, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His name is Brendan,&#34; I state &#34;She was with him and well she didn&#39;t come back injured so I&#39;m guessing he looked after her.&#34; I said and looked up at him. He sighs and sat down &#34;she didn&#39;t take what you told her well,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know and I never expected her to,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I better go,&#34; I said standing up and downing my cup of tea. &#34;She has the nurse coming soon and she needs to plan her diet with her,&#34; I said and started to walk out of the room. He followed me out to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell her I said hi,&#34;he said &#34;and tell her I&#39;m sorry for how I told her, I should have told her differently,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No matter what way you told her she probably would have still taken it badly,&#34; I said and started to walk down the steps &#34;I&#39;ll tell her for you though,&#34; I said and gave him a wave as I walked towards my car. I got in my car to see her asleep. Her eyes opened as soon as I shut the door. She looked at me and then closed her eyes once more. I smiled a little and started the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did he have to say then?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell you when we&#39;re home,&#34; I say. She sighs and gets comfy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we go to the police station first?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want my necklace,&#34; she mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I said, frowning wondering which necklace she was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the cross necklace my mom gave me,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh ok then, wasn&#39;t it in your belongings?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, so I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s with the police. If not then it&#39;s still at the house,&#34; she said and looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok then how about we go to the house first then,&#34; I suggested. She sighs and nods.</p>
