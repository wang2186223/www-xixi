                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn to Darth, I had noticed he picked up the knife a little while ago. I go to the pocket. I pull and take it out. I glance at his watch that looks like Logan&#39;s. Something in me tells me it&#39;s no coincidence he has the same one as him or even the same figure. He even smells like him. But I can&#39;t bring myself to acknowledge that this is Logan fully. That Logan would have me kidnapped, although I don&#39;t think he intended for my kidnapping to be so violent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the knife out, I look up at Darth although I can&#39;t see his eyes, I know he&#39;s looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise not to use that on me, and you can keep it,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise,&#34; I say before turning to Jonathon. He tilts his head at me in question before smirking. I think he finds all of this amusing. I stand in front of him; he looks up at me. &#34;My therapist tells me that taking revenge on you wouldn&#39;t make me feel better,&#34; I say and pause as I lift my leg and place my booted foot on his groin. I lean on my weight on him and watch as he squirms in pain. &#34;I think she&#39;s wrong,&#34; I say as I stomp onto his groin. He screams as in actually screams like a girl; I can&#39;t help but smile a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I notice that Left put his hand to his groin and shifts from one foot to the other. He&#39;s roughly the same build as Carl, which means Right must be David. I look at him; he&#39;s stood how David stands when he&#39;s watching me spar with Brett or Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rubbing my foot into his groin, I grab him by his hair and force him to look at me. Seeing the pain etched on his face is probably the best thing to see right now. I could kill him; I could do anything to him right now, no one would know apart from the three people in this room. Killing him though, seems like an easy escape for him, I&#39;m also not sure if I could go through life knowing I killed someone. He may be a piece of shit and a waste of oxygen, but it&#39;s still a life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and let go of him and take my foot from his groin. He drops forward panting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not worth it,&#34; I say and sit back in my seat. Indeed, he isn&#39;t worthy of any of this; he&#39;s not even worth hating. I had all this anger in me towards him and looking at him now, I feel nothing. He has taken enough from me, and I&#39;m not going to give him any more of my tears, thoughts or feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Muzzle him and chain him back up,&#34; Darth orders Left and Right. They nod and get to work chaining him up. Darth takes my chair and turns it, so I&#39;m facing him. &#34;We will take you back to where we got you from,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What will you do with him?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want us to do with him?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything you want, just don&#39;t kill him, he&#39;s not worthy of death,&#34; I say. He nods a little and wipes my cheek. I&#39;m crying again. I sigh and allow him to wipe my tears away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I move my hand up to his jaw. His hand stops as he looks at me. Slowly I move my thumb over his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; he says quietly, and the voice modifier didn&#39;t pick it up, revealing his English accent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I say quietly and move my hand down from him. He nods a little before clearing his throat and standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will have to blindfold you and tie you up while we take you,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; is all I say and hear the chains moving again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brett paces up and down in the living room. Phone in hand as he worries about Megan. The police are sitting on the sofa, going over with us from when we last saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to her to leave her phone at school?&#34; The police officer asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jonathon must have taken her, I should have listened to her,&#34; he snaps to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s not jump to the worse, you know she&#39;s been acting out for a while now, she&#39;s probably with a friend,&#34; I calmly state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve rung every friend I know her to have, and she&#39;s not with any of them,&#34; he states. I look towards David and Carl. Then I hear the front door open. I sigh in relief as we left her in the cemetery about three hours ago. Not the ideal place to have left her, but it was the only option. I got someone to watch her, but still, anything could have happened. We all walk into the foyer to see her stumble to the stairs, a small bottle of alcohol in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where the hell have you been?&#34; Brett asks her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Out,&#34; she snaps at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems everything is ok here now,&#34; the police officer states. David walks him to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean, out?&#34; Brett asks. &#34;I&#39;ve been worried sick, we all were, Logan has spent hours driving around looking for you,&#34; he snaps. If only he knew, he&#39;d be furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has he?&#34; she asks and looks towards me. She tilts her head and I&#39;m sure theres challenge in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to your face?&#34; he asks as he moves her hair so he can see the bruising better. I could have killed Scott and James for that. &#34; And your hand,&#34; he adds as he takes in her appearance. She hurt her hand when she punched Jonathon; I doubt she noticed it at the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got into a fight,&#34; she says. &#34;Can I go to bed now?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think she knows?&#34; Carl whispers to me. I watch her as Brett nods, she gives him a small smile and walks up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take that,&#34; he says, taking the bottle from her. It would seem she only drank a quarter of the bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever,&#34; she mutters and continues walking up the stairs. She glances at me when she gets to the top, and I realise she&#39;s far from drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She definitely knows,&#34; I say back to Carl.</p>
