                <p>Logan looks at me as we sit next to each other at the dining table. He&#39;s sitting at the head of the table, and I&#39;m sitting at his left side. When we got back, Brett was in, and Eric and Lynn had decided to visit. I had to tell Brett that they didn&#39;t know about Logan and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl, David, and Lorraine are all sat around with us. Lorraine seemed pleased to meet them. I guess it can get lonely been in this house on your own all the time. Lorraine and Lynn get on like a house on fire; they both have a love for cooking. I didn&#39;t know Lynn had her own little business, a small flower shop in town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think, Megan?&#34; Lynn asks me. I look at her and move my foot from Logan&#39;s leg under the table, but he traps my foot between his thighs. His hand moves onto my foot, holding it over his thigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry what?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Working at my shop in the summer? That way you can have some extra money for college,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah sure,&#34; I don&#39;t have the heart to tell her that I won&#39;t be in the country come summer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good it gets hectic in the summer, we sell more potted plants than bouquets,&#34; she says with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know much about plants though,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I have a handy little guide book you can use,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you thought about college?&#34; Eric asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d get the chance to go if I&#39;m honest, I gave up on the idea last year,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; Lynn states, and looks down at her food and an awkward silence fills the table. I feel Logan&#39;s hand move up my calf to my knee. I look at him, and he smirks a little before taking a sip of his water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok,&#34; I say trying to lighten the mood, &#34;before everything happened I had my heart set on Harvard, but because of everything my grades dropped, so I was thinking of doing summer school and maybe pick up some classes and defer a year to get into college, which one I&#39;m not sure. But I think a year out will help, so I&#39;m not too bothered at the moment,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve thought about this a lot,&#34; Logan states. &#34;Is that what you want to do? Do you want to stay here and go to college?&#34; He asks, and I realise what he&#39;s asking. I shrug and look down at my plate of food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I get good grades, I could go to college anywhere. Thanks to the inheritance from my mom, I have options,&#34; I state and look back at him. He lets go of my foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see,&#34; he states, and stands up, making my foot drop to the floor. He picks up his plate and walks out with it. I sigh and look back at my food. It seems Lynn hadn&#39;t noticed that Logan isn&#39;t happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good, options are a good thing, have you thought of travelling?&#34; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;ll be good,&#34; Brett states, &#34;your mother wanted to travel,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve not thought about travelling,&#34; I say getting up and picking up my plate. &#34;Is anyone else done?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shake their heads, take my plate into the kitchen. Logan is rinsing the pots and putting them in the dishwasher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you annoyed with me?&#34; I ask. He shakes his head without looking at me. &#34;When I say options I mean so I have options in England,&#34; I state. He stops and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not annoyed with you, I&#39;m annoyed at myself, I should have realised that there are things you&#39;d want to do, I can&#39;t expect you to put your life on hold for me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not putting my life on hold for you, I want to come to England and if I want to do anything like travelling I will. I&#39;ll do it with you,&#34; I state and place my hand on his chest. &#34;What are you thinking?&#34; I ask, and move him away from the sink. &#34;I told you I wanted to go with you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I just didn&#39;t think about what you wanted to do before you met me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before I met you, I wanted to go to Harvard, and that was it. I&#39;d planned on making sure Tyler got the grades to come with me. I didn&#39;t even think of anything else,&#34; I pause and look away from him, &#34;and then when everything was happening, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d get to college, I thought he&#39;d kill me before I&#39;d get the chance,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now, what do you think of doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides you?&#34; I ask with a smile and move my hands down his body to the buckle of his jeans, &#34;I&#39;ve honestly not thought about studying, I&#39;ve just been taking every day as it comes, I&#39;m in no rush to go to college or travel the world, I just want to get through each day at the moment,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OK,&#34; is all he says, and leans in to kiss me. &#34;When you know, tell me,&#34; he says between kisses. I then hear someone clear their throat. We pull away from each other and look to see David with Brett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I move away from Logan and walk out of the kitchen, leaving him to deal with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan looks at me as I lay across his bed in only his t-shirt and a pair of panties. Lynn and Eric are staying and only went to bed just over half an hour ago, and I texted him asking him when he was coming to bed, and I got no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look away from him back to my phone to carry on playing my game. I feel the bed weigh down, and his hands move up my bare legs to stop at my thong. He kisses my neck and moves up to my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I was discussing something with Carl,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm, you seem to spend more time with Carl than me lately,&#34; I state, not looking away from my city simulation game. &#34;There&#39;s only so much satisfaction a girl can get by herself,&#34; I say, and as I say it, I feel his hands move up my body even further. He sits across my butt and moves his hand up my back to my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You never said anything to me,&#34; he lifts his t-shirt to my shoulders and massages up and down my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I figured you were enjoying your time with Carl, he must do things I don&#39;t do,&#34; I state with a small smile. He flips me over onto my back, so I&#39;m looking up at him. He takes my phone out of my hand and places it on the bedside table before moving the t-shirt I&#39;m wearing up over my head and holds my arms above my head with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me when I say no one does anything that you do to me,&#34; he states and leans in to press his lips to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what&#39;s going on with you? If I didn&#39;t wake up next to you, I&#39;d think you were ignoring me,&#34; He sighs and moves off me to sit at the end of the bed. I kneel behind him and move my arms around him, pressing my hands to his chest while laying my head on his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m stressed,&#34; he states &#34;And I took that out on you earlier, I&#39;m worried about you, Jonathan, going back to England, I&#39;m trying my best to make you feel safe, and I feel like I&#39;m failing you,&#34; he explains and places his hands on mine. &#34;I&#39;d never let him hurt you again, and don&#39;t get me started on how I&#39;m feeling about the students that talk about you, that stresses me out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I ask. He turns and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s more than just Tyler and his friends, have you not noticed how they say hi to you more and more, they want you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I don&#39;t want them, I want you, I have to put up with how the girls talk about you, I just sit in class thinking, ha I&#39;ve seen him naked,&#34; I say with a smile, and he smirks. &#34;I&#39;m not interested in anyone else but you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I just sometimes think you&#39;d be better off with anyone else but me,&#34; he says. I frown and move my hand up to his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you thinking like this? I don&#39;t understand where this is coming from this insecurity. You&#39;re not bad for me Logan, you&#39;re too hard on yourself, everything you do for me is perfect,&#34; I sigh and press my lips to his. &#34;I feel safe, I know I don&#39;t go out anywhere, I know I&#39;m keeping myself trapped, but that&#39;s something only I can control, that&#39;s for me to figure out myself. You don&#39;t need to be worried about me, look at me, I&#39;m sitting here in front of you in just my underwear, a few months ago, I never thought I&#39;d get to this point. You gave parts of me back that I thought had died, and I know no one else, but you could have done this,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a good man Megan,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish you&#39;d see yourself how I see you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I scared you today,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I say honestly. &#34;I know you&#39;d never hurt me physically. I was scared because you&#39;ve never shouted at me like that before, it was different. I didn&#39;t want you to be angry with me, and I thought maybe you were finding me annoying with the things you said, which made me question if you want to be with me, that&#39;s what I was scared of,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he states and kisses me. I move my hands to his neck, holding him to me.</p>
