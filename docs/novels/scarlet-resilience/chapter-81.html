                <p>When we got back Megan went straight up to her room and I haven&#39;t seen her since. It&#39;s not half one in the morning and I know she&#39;s awake but I don&#39;t want to disturb her or upset her. I heard Melanie try and speak to her but Megan told her to leave her alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first thing I did when we got back was go to the gym I needed to let off this anger it didn&#39;t exactly work though as I&#39;m still fuming. I had promised her I would never let him hurt again and this happens I don&#39;t even know what he fully did to her. I want to know but I also don&#39;t just because I know it probably make me go insane with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the gym I went and picked my dog up from my aunt and uncles. I had changed my mind on having him stay here while we were in England. He&#39;d miss me and he&#39;s my joint first best friend with Carl so I&#39;d miss him too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m now sat smoking a joint while watching a very old movie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I hear Megan&#39;s voice say. I die the joint out and waft the smoke from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said and look at her to see her stood wearing my shirt and bottoms. She pulls on my shirt a little and looks down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I sit with you?&#34; she asks. I nod and watch her walk over to me. She sits down next to me and holds her legs to her chest. &#34;I cut myself,&#34; she said quietly. I look at her &#34;I know you&#39;re probably angry at me for doing it and you&#39;ll most likely find out that I&#39;ve done it that&#39;s why I&#39;m telling you,&#34; she explains quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In all honesty I knew you were going to,&#34; I said &#34;is it bad?&#34; I ask. She shakes her head and looks at me. &#34;Can I see?&#34; I ask. She nods and stands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch her stand in front of me and watch her slowly lift her top up to reveal cuts on the side of her rib cage. There are about five clear cuts all shakily done but clear. They aren&#39;t deep which is good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re mad,&#34; she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...no I&#39;m not,&#34; I said and take her hand in mine. &#34;Come here,&#34; I said and pull her down to me and hold her tightly. &#34;I&#39;d never be angry with you not over this,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have to go you know,&#34; Logan said looking at me and moving hair behind my ear. I knew what he was doing, he wants me to feel better but staying here wouldn&#39;t make me feel better in the slightest. &#34;You haven&#39;t slept and...&#34; he sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan I&#39;m fine,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I should really take you to the hospital for your nose,&#34; he said looking me in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine Logan it&#39;s just bruised,&#34; I said looking at him. &#34;I need a shower and I want to go to England I want to get out of America away from all of this,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I&#39;ll go get dressed while you get a shower,&#34; he said and hugs me tightly and walks out of my room. I smile and walk into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get the quickest shower I can possibly get just because I know that if I stay in too long in there my mind will wonder to the most horrible thoughts. I look at myself in the mirror and straight away I notice the bruise forming over the bridge of my nose. My cheek is swollen and bruised too along with around my eye. I sigh to myself and move onto the buffet in front of my mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of having to cover more bruises frustrated me. That thought hadn&#39;t come into my head in months and here I am doing it again. I stand and pick up the clothes I had already gotten out ready for the plane to England.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan walks into my room as I sit back onto my buffet. He looks at me as I brush through my hair. He smiles and I look away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he asks sitting down next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34; I said and start to put make up on. He sighs and watches me. &#34;Would you like me to put some on you too?&#34; I ask. He smirks and shakes his head &#34;you&#39;re looking at me like how I used to look at my mother when she put hers on,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how&#39;s that?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like you want some on yourself and want to learn how to do it,&#34; I pause &#34;I always watched my mother put her make up on. When I was younger she&#39;d kiss me on the lips after putting her lipstick or lip gloss on so I&#39;d have some on too,&#34; I said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were you close to her?&#34; Logan asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very we did a lot of things together, she was more my best friend than my mother just because she was so laid back,&#34; I pause and look at him &#34;are you wanting some lip gloss on then?&#34; I ask with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up,&#34; he huffs and looks away from me. I laugh and sit back on my buffet. &#34;Are you done?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, do I look ok?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look ok,&#34; he said and I frown at him as he didn&#39;t sound too convincing. &#34;It&#39;s just I prefer you without make up,&#34; he explains and looks down as if he thinks whathe said was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good that means you won&#39;t get too comfortable with my make up face,&#34; I said with a smile and kiss him on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I link my arm with Logan&#39;s as we stand waiting for the car to pick us up. It&#39;s raining and I&#39;m freezing. We didn&#39;t sleep on the plane. When I said we I mean me and Logan, I know that he stopped himself from sleeping so that he could keep me company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It always rains here,&#34; Melanie says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you know that do you?&#34; Logan snaps at her &#34;I&#39;m guessing you know that because you&#39;re always here and you&#39;ve spent all your life here,&#34; I look at him to see him mutter swear words under his breath calling her a stupid bitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I just,&#34; I cut her off and look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just leave it,&#34; I said to her and give her a small smile just to make sure she didn&#39;t think I was being funny with her. She looks away and sighs while folding her arms. I sigh and watch as a limousine pulls up in font of us and a man in a black suit gets out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry I&#39;m late sir the traffic was horrible,&#34; he says. The man looked the similar age to my grandfather. He looks at Logan and then at me and onto Melanie and the others. &#34;I thought there was only going to be six of you,&#34; the man states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two at the last minute, that&#39;s why I changed which estate we&#39;d be staying at,&#34; Logan states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah ok is it a bedroom each sir?&#34; he asks opening the boot. He smiles and takes our bags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not too sure yet,&#34; Logan said as he opens the car door. &#34;Did you get our suitcases?&#34; he asks as he nods for us all to get in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir they arrived early this morning,&#34; he said and finishes off putting our travel bags in. I get in and then Logan does. &#34;I was quite surprised when you phoned a few weeks ago and you told me you were coming back home for good,&#34; the man says. I look at Logan and he sighs &#34;but you changed your mind which is what I expected you&#39;d do,&#34; he said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan moves his arm around my shoulders and kisses the top of my head. He gets comfy and I watch him tilt his head back and close his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You all might as well get comfy we&#39;ve got about an hour and half drive,&#34; he says. I get comfy next to him and yawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll leave you all to rest seen as you look like you haven&#39;t slept in days,&#34; he said looking at Logan and then pressing the button above him to move the screen up.</p>
