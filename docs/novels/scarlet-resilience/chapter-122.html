                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s strange I&#39;ve been expecting him to want me to touch him since earlier but he hasn&#39;t. Everytime I touch him he redirects my hands to his neck, I don&#39;t really understand. He&#39;s saying to me that he&#39;ll have a hard time controlling himself if I do touch him but I thought that&#39;s what men like. Is he lying to me? Did I not do it right? Or is what he is saying the truth and he&#39;s just trying to protect me from himself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dry my hands and look in the mirror to see my hair is a mess but the bags under my eyes have faded so I can&#39;t complain. I should probably ask him why he doesn&#39;t want me to touch him rather than jump to conclusion but I don&#39;t know how to bring up a conversation like that. The last thing I want is for us to end up arguing. I take a deep breath and open the door to the bathroom to walk out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I call as I walk out. He turns to look at me and I see that he&#39;s stood talking to David. I feel myself blush at the fact I&#39;m stood in nothing but my panties and Logans t-shirt that only just covered me. I pulls on his t-shirt a little and I notice Logan smile at me and I know he&#39;s laughing on the inside. I sigh and walk behind the desk to hide myself a little more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi,&#34; I say with a small wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Miss Wright. How are you feeling today?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither good nor bad,&#34; I say with a tilt of my head. Logan frowns and they both walk towards me. It is then I notice the plates on the coffee table. I watch them both sit in the chairs at the desk. I sit in the desk chair and I know they&#39;re about to ask me what is wrong. &#34;Due to what his Uncle has been doing and his idiotic actions it&#39;s hard to feel good, yet to be back with him it&#39;s hard to feel bad,&#34; I explain and Logan just looks anywhere but at me or David.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told him just how stupid he is,&#34; David says referring to Logan &#34;As for his uncle, Logan has told me your plan and I admit, it is a good plan, I&#39;ve always said behind every good man there&#39;s an even better woman,&#34; he says looking between Logan and I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it is if it all works out, Logan has to do his part,&#34; I say looking at Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It will not be difficult, Mr Peters loves his women, I think tonight will be a good time to start, I&#39;ll get someone following him right away, I&#39;ll also look into the company books for you,&#34; He says looking between Logan and I. I give him a small smile and watch him stand. &#34;Enjoy the rest of your day, I sent them all to a theme park, I told them you weren&#39;t feeling well and that Logan intended to speak to you,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me about your parents,&#34; I say looking at Logan. I&#39;m laid between his legs with my back to his chest. We had finished watching a movie and were talking about my mom. He had asked me about her and I told him everything from the way she laughed to what her favourite item in her wardrobe was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s not much to tell, they worked and argued a lot, my mother was really nice the first few years, I think it was when my father started cheating on her that she stopped caring for me. I think I reminded her of him too much. My father was always distant and cold towards me, when I got in trouble he used to hit me but only got really violent a few times. That&#39;s why I&#39;m close to David, he would tell my father when enough was enough and he&#39;d be the one who would bandage me up and try and make sure it didn&#39;t happen again but it always did. I think he just took things out on me really,&#34; he explains. I look down at his stomach as I try to take all that information in. It makes me sad to have Logan think his parents never loved him. It&#39;s not like he can ask them or ever find out why they did the things they did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s horrible,&#34; I say and hug him tightly. I can&#39;t even picture a child version of Logan, let alone one terrified and hurting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not that bad really,&#34; he says, hugging me back. &#34;My mother always tried to show me off because well I have an IQ of 150 or I did, I don&#39;t know now with all my idiotic moves,&#34; he says. &#34;She got me to play the piano and study most nights of my life. My father got me into kick boxing when I was young as I was apparently weak. David taught me that,&#34; he says and then looks down at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;David was like a father to you then?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah but don&#39;t tell him that, he&#39;ll get a big head,he already acts like my father,&#34; he states and I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He just cares for you, he wants you to be happy,&#34; I say and press my lips to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What really happened between you two?&#34; Yasmin says once Melanie and Julie both left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they came back from their day out I had all three of them asking me what Logan wanted to talk to me about. Luckily Logan and I spoke about the excuse I would make and that was; he wanted to speak to me to let me know that he still cares about me and that we couldn&#39;t be together now that the Principal Mrs Kitson had seen us together in Paris. That part threw the girls which meant I had to explain to them what happened in Paris, I just missed out the fact we had sat with them and had breakfast. I made up that Mrs Kitson wanted to speak to Logan privately which led to his decision to break things off in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Melanie seemed to be a little annoyed at the fact I have agreed to still be friends with him but she didn&#39;t voice that, I could just tell by the look on her face. Julie however thought it was sweet and thinks we&#39;ll end up getting back together even though I profusely told her it wasn&#39;t going to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you tell everything?&#34; I ask her as I lay down. She lays next to me and smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s because I&#39;m not stupid, plus I saw you both early this morning, I kept the bedroom door open because I was worried about you, When I looked out I saw you walking with him down the hall,&#34; she explains and I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was going to tell you anyway,&#34; I say and give her a small smile. &#34;We are back together, we just want to keep it quiet because people seem to want to get involved and I know you don&#39;t want to and he&#39;s going to tell Carl,&#34; I explain and she smiles at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was his real reason?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His uncle had blackmailed him and some fears he has, as he has to move back over here at the end of this year and it just made him a little scared,&#34; I answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think that&#39;s more than a little scared,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe but I just have to make sure he knows that it&#39;s a stupid fear,&#34; I say with a tilt of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I ask you something?&#34; I ask. I never got to have the conversation with Logan over why he wouldn&#39;t allow me to touch him and it bothers me. We were having a good day so bringing the subject up didn&#39;t seem right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; she says, laying her head on the pillow and yawning. &#34;I have a question for you after,&#34; she states and I smile a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan wouldn&#39;t let me touch him you know in...that way,&#34; I say using my hands as I try to convey to her what I mean and she frowns at me. I sigh &#34;Sexually,&#34; I say and she smiles. &#34;He touched me but when I tried to do it to him he said &#39;I was the only one to be pleasured today and then told me if I touch him he won&#39;t be able to control himself,&#34; I pause to see her reaction but her face isn&#39;t giving me anything. &#34;I don&#39;t understand that, if he enjoys it why won&#39;t he let me?&#34; I ask her and she smiles at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re such a worrier, he practically told you why. He just wanted to pleasure you, he didn&#39;t want anything in return, you do know that&#39;s not how sex always works right? Just because one does something to the other doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re in that person&#39;s debt, you know that right?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess,&#34; I say, frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened with you and Tyler?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well we didn&#39;t do things often, but it was sort of one for one,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean, sort of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I never had an orgasm with Tyler,&#34; I say slowly and she chuckles to herself a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good job it doesn&#39;t work out like a one for one because Tyler would be in debt with you,&#34; she says and I laugh at her. I can feel my cheeks have heated up throughout this conversation and I know that&#39;s one of the reasons for her laughing. &#34;Listen the only way you&#39;re going to know fully what he meant is if you ask him,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t wanna,&#34; I groan as I turn onto my back. &#34;It&#39;s embarrassing, it&#39;s not fair that he has all the experience,&#34; I say and she laughs. &#34;And what if he thinks I&#39;m being stupid?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He won&#39;t, just ask him when you&#39;re next alone with him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I can do that,&#34; I say with a roll of my eyes and Yasmin laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your embarrassment in this subject is really cute,&#34; she pauses and takes on a serious expression</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think he meant what he said, he wants to be able to have control when he&#39;s with you. To not scare you away,&#34; she explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess, what was your question?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why was Brendan in here with you last night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He came in to see how I am and fell asleep while watching a movie with me,&#34; I explain and she frowns. &#34;Why? Did you think something else?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Logan came into your room before you left and he left looking very angry, at first I didn&#39;t understand why until this morning when Brendan left your room. So I thought maybe he saw something he shouldn&#39;t have,&#34; she explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; I say. Logan never mentioned anything about Brendan to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so tired, who knew theme parks were so tiring, I ate so much,&#34; Yasmin moans and I smile. &#34;I&#39;ll go to bed in a minute, oh did I tell you Scott kissed Julie,&#34; she says suddenly awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, when did this happen?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Today, while they were waiting in line for a ride,&#34; she says. &#34;And Melanie and Cade seem to be in better spirits too,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He told me he&#39;s going to break up with her when we get back,&#34; I tell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh My God really,&#34; she says and I feel like I&#39;m gossiping. &#34;Tell me,&#34; she says, now sitting up. I chuckle slightly and sit up too. I sigh and then give her a smile as I start to tell her what he said.</p>
