                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take off my dress and tights and walk into the walk in wardrobe. I pull on a pair of night bottoms and a vest top. I walk back out to see Logan laid on the bed. He sits up and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to join me on this bed?&#34; he asks tilting his head at me. I smile and walk towards him. He pulls me on top of him and kisses me. He plays with my hands with his and then pulls back and lays down. &#34;You&#39;ve had a lot to drink,&#34; he says. I smile and lay down next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So have you,&#34; I said and lay my head on his chest. His hand moves around my shoulders and then down my back to my bum &#34;you&#39;re so smooth,&#34; I said and he laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do try,&#34; he said and a comfortable silence laces over us. I watch him as he twines his fingers with mine. &#34;When&#39;s your birthday?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been and gone,&#34; I said closing my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? When?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was the day after valentines day,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell?&#34; he said getting up and looking down at me. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me or said anything?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think it was relevant,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your birthday?&#34; he asks &#34;you don&#39;t think your birthday is relevant,&#34; he shakes his head in disbelief and sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t celebrated my birthday in a while,&#34; I said &#34;so it&#39;s not a relevant day to me,&#34; I said and waft my hand in my face trying to cool myself down. He places his hand on my leg and looks down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m shocked, I really can&#39;t believe you find your birthday unimportant,&#34; he said shaking his head. I smile at him and close my eyes. I feel him move and his hand move off my leg. The feeling of his lips on my neck made me smile. My eyes open and I let him kiss up my neck to my chin. He looks at me and moves fully on top of me. &#34;It&#39;s nice to be able to kiss you without having Max barking at me,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm it&#39;s only because you&#39;ve not let him in the room which is unfair,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s unfair that he doesn&#39;t allow me to kiss my girlfriend, I&#39;m the real victim,&#34; he says. I laugh and move my arms around his neck and kiss him on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our kisses all night have been passionate and lust filled but it&#39;s these kisses I like the most. The innocent soft and gentle ones, the ones that give me butterflies and make me smile every time. He pulls back and moves off me sitting up. I move a leg on his lap and sit up. He looks at me and I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me get changed and I shall be back,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you need to get changed you always sleep in your boxers,&#34; I said and he smiles and takes his top off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; he said and unbuckles his jeans. I move my leg off him and lay back. I frown when I notice he&#39;s wearing bold blue boxers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you wearing superman boxers?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; he said and I laugh &#34;what? Don&#39;t you think they suit me?&#34; he asks standing up &#34;I&#39;m sure they make my butt look amazing,&#34; he said turning to show me his butt which had a big Superman logo imprinted onto it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They do but still I never imagined you to be in Superman boxers,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What boxers do you imagine me in?&#34; he asks smiling at me and sitting back on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well your usual Calvin Klein and just plain black or grey ones,&#34; I said and he lays next to me. I turn on my side and he moves his hands to my hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is your nose feeling? Does it hurt?&#34; he asks and strokes my nose with his index finger on his right hand. I close my eyes and then look at him. His clear blue eyes staring back at me, I shake my head and he pulls me close to him so we&#39;re touching. He kisses my nose and smiles to himself. &#34;Good, I was genuinely scared,&#34; he said and I frown. &#34;I just knew there was something wrong and when we found where he was and that the doors were locked everything just went through my mind,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aww bless you,&#34; I said stroking a bit of his hair and tucking it behind his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not expect to see what I saw when I opened the door,&#34; he says. &#34;I&#39;m really proud of you,&#34; he said and kisses my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? For stabbing him?&#34; I ask. He nods and kisses my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It may be a violent act but I really don&#39;t care, I hope you&#39;ve killed him,&#34; he pauses and we&#39;re silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then pulls away from me and lays on his back. He moves his hand to his face and it&#39;s then I notice he&#39;s crying. My eyes widen and I almost feel a bit awkward, why is he crying? Isn&#39;t it supposed to me because I&#39;m the girl and I&#39;ve drunk a little more than him tonight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I said sitting up and crossing my legs. He sits up and puts his back to me. &#34;Logan,&#34; I said and move next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; he said and I frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan you&#39;re really freaking me out why are you being so...&#34; I sigh as a word isn&#39;t coming into my head. &#34;Why are you saying sorry?&#34; I ask instead. He doesn&#39;t answer me and I get up and stand in front of him. I move onto my knees and look at him. &#34;Logan,&#34; I say. He wasn&#39;t a person to cry he&#39;s cried once in front of me and it wasn&#39;t like this, it was probably a teardrop, I didn&#39;t even see his face when he did cry. &#34;Logan, you&#39;re scaring me,&#34; I said and I can feel myself getting upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan clears his throat and wipes his eyes&#34; It&#39;s nothing,&#34; he said and hugs me. I frown and pull away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Logan it&#39;s not nothing, tell me,&#34; I demand and stand up he sighs and looks down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promised you I&#39;d not let him hurt you not ever and then he did and I feel like I&#39;ve let you down and that I&#39;m to blame,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I said and smile a little and move a hand through his hair. &#34;You&#39;re really stupid,&#34; I said and he looks up at me. I move on top of him move my hands to his head making him look at me. &#34;Do you think I blame you?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should,&#34; he said looking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well tough I don&#39;t,&#34; I said and kiss him on the lips. &#34;Very far from it, you may not ever understand how I felt when I heard you come through that door because at that moment it was probably the best sound I had ever heard in my life because I truly thought he was going to get his way,&#34; I pause and look him in the eyes &#34;don&#39;t blame yourself, I don&#39;t blame you not one bit,&#34; I say. &#34;Now can I have a kiss?&#34; I ask causing him to nod in respond and lean in to kiss me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lays down and moves on top of me. The feeling of his hands moves under my top didn&#39;t faze me, I do want to go a little further with him I just get so nervous with him. With Brendan and Carl I&#39;ve been drunk each time, I didn&#39;t even know Carl had name, well I did but I didn&#39;t remember it the next morning. Logan&#39;s just completely different, I&#39;m nervous of the fact once we do take our relationship a little further he&#39;ll want to go a little more. The nightmares of him don&#39;t help me either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opens causing Logan to pull away from me, I look to see Carl had been the one to open the door and Max runs in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry it&#39;s just your dog was laid out here doing nothing and looking all sad, carry on with your foreplay,&#34; he said &#34;Nice boxers I have some exactly the same,&#34; he said &#34;and a bat...&#34; he cuts off once Max had finished looking around the room and started barking at Logan once again. I frown and Logan gets off me and he stops. I move all my weight onto my elbows and look at Max. He jumps up on the bed and looks at me. Logan moves back on top of me to hug me and Max starts to bark again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is wrong with you?&#34; Logan asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? What?&#34; Carl asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He just barks at me every time I touch her,&#34; Logan said and I can see how frustrated he is over it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it just you?&#34; Carl asks walking in and sitting on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, see if he does it to you,&#34; Logan says. Carl leans close to me and hugs me and Max barks at him and starts to growl while moving on the bed. &#34;He never used to do it,&#34; Logan said and strokes him. I look down at Max.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe he&#39;s protective of me,&#34; I said and they look at each other then at Max then at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe,&#34; they said at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you coming down to play a bit of poker?&#34; Carl asks Logan &#34;have you been crying?&#34; Carl asks and looks at him more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he pauses &#34;Megan hit me,&#34; he said and my jaw drops and then closes as Carl looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feisty, I like,&#34; he pauses &#34;by the way my plan is going well,&#34; he said looking at me and winking &#34;I shall be one with the Irish,&#34; he said and I then click on what he&#39;s on about. My jaw drops as he gets up and walks out of our room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s he on about?&#34; Logan asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s trying to get into Yasmin but she&#39;s a hard girl to seduce. Many have tried and failed,&#34; I explain and Logan shakes his head and stands up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon boy,&#34; he said, walking towards the door and opening it. Max doesn&#39;t move causing Logan to sigh and walk towards him and pull Max by the collar. He pulls him off the bed and out of the room. He stands at the door, shutting it a little so Max can&#39;t get past him. &#34;I love you, I really do but I can&#39;t take you doing this anymore,&#34; he pauses &#34;I&#39;m sorry we will talk in the morning,&#34; he said and shuts the door. I start to laugh at him and he looks at me &#34;That&#39;s how you break up with your dog,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for the lesson, I shall use it later on in life,&#34; I said and take my bottoms off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ohh we&#39;re getting naked ok,&#34; he said and I smile at him and watch him climb into bed. I get in and turn the lamp off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are we doing tomorrow?&#34; I ask laying me head on his chest. He strokes up and down my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t we go shopping, I need to get a tuxedo or suit one or the other. We&#39;ll go into Leeds, we would go to London but there are certain people I don&#39;t want to know I&#39;m here,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The managers of my company, if they know I&#39;m here they&#39;ll start making me have meetings with them,&#34; he says. I move my hand up to his neck and twirl the bit of hair at the nape of his neck with my fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, what sort of meetings?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very long meetings that will probably take up most of my time here,&#34; he states and I look down.  &#34;They will probably find out but hopefully it won&#39;t be this week,&#34; he said and tightens his arms around my waist.</p>
