                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We get back home and start on making dinner. He had helped me with the chicken marinade and had even cut all the vegetables up. He had also tried to make his own dip in which he failed on and I found it hysterical and because of that I am now washing his very disgusting red dip out of my hair. He was now sitting in my bedroom waiting for me to finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hurry up Megan I have to go in like ten minutes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well my hair still smells of your disgusting dip,&#34; I said, biting my bottom lip waiting for him to retaliate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will kindly wash your hair for you while you bathe,&#34; he said and I can hear him getting frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m nearly done,&#34; I said and rinsed the remaining conditioner out of my hair. I then turn the shower off and wrap my towel around me and walk out into my room to see him laid on my bed. He looks at me and sits up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally I thought you had drowned,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In a shower?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can if you fall and hit your head and pass out, that&#39;s it you drown on a cm of water,&#34; he said and I laugh causing him to laugh and pull me to him by my towel. He leans up to kiss me, I turn my head so he gets my cheek. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every time we kiss I want more and you know my problem hasn&#39;t exactly gotten better,&#34; he nods and moves his hands from around me. &#34;You should go,&#34; I said and he stands and kisses the top of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to take your medication,&#34; he said and makes me look at him, &#34;you&#39;re amazing,&#34; he said moves his hands into mine as he walks away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So are you when you want to be,&#34; I said with a small smile and he gives me a smile before shutting the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sit on my bed and move my hands onto legs. I slowly lift the towel up to reveal the scratches on my thighs. They were just red, no blood although I had torn a bit of skin. I don&#39;t think Logan fully realises how big my problem is and how much it does actually affect me. I sigh and move the towel back over my legs and start to dry myself. I get dressed in a pair of bottoms and a vest top and lay back in bed. For some reason I just wanted to lay and not do anything like my body didn&#39;t have and energy to do anything but that and my mind wasn&#39;t in the right frame to even think of anything else but all the bad things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Yasmin, Julie and Melanie all three of them sat on a stool in front of me. I had managed to get them to stay behind. Julie was highly reluctant, Melanie didn&#39;t have a choice and Yasmin wasn&#39;t that bothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you all doing today?&#34; I ask and they shrug. &#34;Ok so I was wondering if you&#39;d like to come round to see Megan for dinner?&#34; I ask and Julie and Melanie sigh &#34;I know you&#39;re not happy with me but the real reason why she didn&#39;t come in today is because she is really down and I thought having a small dinner party or something would cheer her up,&#34; I explain &#34;and I know if I hadn&#39;t had done what I had done I wouldn&#39;t have to do this but I did and I&#39;m trying to make up for it so will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will gets me a chance to get away from home,&#34; Yasmin said and U frown a little at that &#34;I have very pushy parents but if I said I&#39;m going to see Megan they&#39;re like oh good go see her she needs  friend at the moment, it&#39;s weird really to hear my parents said something nice,&#34; she axplain and I smile a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pushy parents are the worst,&#34; I said and look at Melanie and Julie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She hates me at the moment,&#34; Melanie said and I sigh about to said something &#34;I pretty much called her a whore so that&#39;s why,&#34; she pauses &#34;I&#39;ll come round so I can said sorry,&#34; she says</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring Brendan too,&#34; I said &#34;I have to speak to him about something,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm okay,&#34; she said dragging out the &#39;a&#39; with a bewildered look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine I&#39;ll go if they&#39;re going I don&#39;t want to seem like the bad friend but don&#39;t expect me to be nice to you just because she forgave you,&#34; Julie huffs &#34;if you were my boyfriend I would have cut your manhood off,&#34; she adds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you and please don&#39;t share that idea with Megan,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I might just,&#34; she said and I sigh a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be round about 5,&#34; I said standing &#34;my friends will be there too,&#34; I said and undo my tie &#34;do any of you want a lift home?&#34; I ask wanting them to said no. I wanted to get back to Megan and make sure she was ok. They shake their head &#34;oh good,&#34; I said smiling and pick up my things</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk into the house and drop my bag and take off my shoes. I make my way up to her room and walk in to see her laid in bed. She was sat staring at her phone. Her eyes land on me and a small smile creases on her face. She climbs out of bed and walks towards me and hugs me. I hug her back and kiss the top of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did I do to deserve this welcoming?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I missed you,&#34; she said and leans up to give me a kiss. I smile and kiss her back. She pulls at my tie making my closer to her. I pull back and move my hands around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I missed you too,&#34; I said smiling and look behind her to see her box was out and open. I look back at her &#34;I invited Melanie, Yasmin and Julie round for dinner, they said they&#39;d come and Melanie also told me you and her weren&#39;t talking because she&#39;d called you something?&#34; I ask showing I didn&#39;t quite understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She accused me of sleeping with Brendan because I&#39;m very far from a virgin,&#34; she said and looked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh well she wants to say sorry to you, I also told her to invite Brendan so I can say sorry to him,&#34; I inform and she looks at me and smiles &#34;what?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing I just didn&#39;t think you would. I also didn&#39;t expect you to invite him,&#34; she said and moved her hands up my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;m trying to make you happy and he&#39;s your friend so I have to try and get on with him. I don&#39;t have to like him though,&#34; I said and she smiles at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; she said &#34;I should probably check on the food I haven&#39;t checked on it yet,&#34; she tells me and walks out past me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get a shower,&#34; I call to her as I walk towards her bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach for her box and look inside to see there was nothing in it. My eyebrows furrow as I look down at it. I look around and then notice the bin. I stand and walk towards it looking down to see blooded tissues. This meant she had cut herself and broke her promise to me because she feels like she can&#39;t trust me enough anymore to tell me. There was no one to blame but me for this and if I want to stay with her I have to do everything I can to get her to trust me again.</p>
