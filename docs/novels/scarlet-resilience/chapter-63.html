                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wake and look around hoping Logan would be next to me but he isn&#39;t. I sigh and climb out of bed and walk into my bathroom to get a quick shower and then get change into some bottoms and a vest top. Walking down the stairs I see Carl sat watching TV. He looks at me and gives me a smile and I softly smile at him and walk into the kitchen to make a drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan&#39;s on his way home,&#34; Carl shouts to me &#34;he said he needs to talk to you when he comes in, straight away. He has to tell you something,&#34; he says. I walk in and sit down on the other couch</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does he want to tell me?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; he said &#34;did you sleep well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No really,&#34; I said and look at my phone to see Logan hadn&#39;t text or rang me was he really that angry he wouldn&#39;t even bother to text or ring me. I had a feeling that what he wanted to talk to me about I would not like at all. Something bad and horrible that will probably hurt me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry he probably just wants to tell you how sorry he is and that he wants to know fully why you went to go see your father,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah you&#39;re right,&#34; I said and finish off my juice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour passes until Logan&#39;s home. He walked straight into the lounge and asked me to come upstairs. He had also kicked Carl out of the house with Max so it was just me and him. We were sat on my bed and he has his head in hands and muttered a few words to me but hasn&#39;t said anything since. It was obviously something bad or he wouldn&#39;t be like this with me. Then it came to me, he was going to break up with me I could see it, he had come to his senses that this relationship couldn&#39;t work because of the fact he&#39;s my teacher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A...Are you breaking up with me?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What! No!&#34; he said quickly. I nod showing I understood &#34;Never,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said &#34;so what is it? Did you kill someone? Get into a fight? Or all of the above?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right now I wish I had,&#34; he said under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm ok,&#34; I said confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t sleep at my aunt and uncles last night,&#34; he says. I nod showing I understand &#34;I just want you to know before I tell you that I&#39;m so sorry and I never intended to do what I&#39;ve done or intend to hurt you,&#34; he says. I gulp down the scared lump in my throat and I watch him gulp too &#34;I went out with a few of the lads and I had a bit to drink and I met this girl and I kissed her and then we ended at hers and...&#34; he trails off as he looks at me. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry and I know alcohol is no excuse and I&#39;m not using it as an excuse,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; I ask knowing full well what happened by the look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I slept with her,&#34; he says. I stand and walk into my bathroom and shut and lock the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feeling of the cold floor now feels warm. My bum hand gone numb but what would I expect I had been sat in here for a about an hour and half. As soon ashe said those four words, my mind went blank, I didn&#39;t know what to said to him or do, I just wanted to be away from him. He was still in my room I heard him moving about and every now and then he talks to me. My mind had tried to come up for reasons as to why this was happening and what I could do. All it came up with was that it was my own doing, if I had told him about me wanting to see my father none of this would have happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan please come out,&#34; he begs. I had looked under the door to see he was now sat against the door which was exactly what I was doing. &#34;Please,&#34; he adds and I sigh. &#34;Ok,&#34; he sighs after a few minutes &#34;can you just at least said something so I know you&#39;re ok?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did he think I was going to do? My mind was like a fresh piece of paper completely blank I wasn&#39;t planning anything, I wasn&#39;t thinking of anything, I&#39;m not even doing anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry, I wish I could go back in time and slap myself for even thinking about going out in the first place,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then when he finishes that sentence I hear a door slam and Carl shouting if anyone is in. Logan doesn&#39;t answer him and neither do I. I hear my bedroom door open and I slowly press my ear to my bathroom door to listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happened?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; Logan lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan just tell me what&#39;s happened. Where&#39;s Megan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went out last night and cheated on her and now she&#39;s locked herself in the bathroom,&#34; he said and I sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to be here, I wanted to be as far away as I could, this had to be a dream even hearing him said it to someone else hurt me. I had never felt pain like this, it was worse than any physical pain I had endured over the past two years. Why did he even have to tell me? Couldn&#39;t he just not said anything and not cause me this pain? He must enjoy it in order to do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did what? Why would you do that? Did you lose half of your brain in the last forty hours? You&#39;re unbelievable no wonder she&#39;s locked herself in the goddamn bathroom. You&#39;ve really screwed up and lucky if she does take you back,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think I know that,&#34; Logan snapped at him. &#34;But hey it&#39;ll be all good for you right?&#34; Logan said sarcastically. I sigh and bring my knees up to my chest</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been waiting for this, go on start with the threats,&#34; Carl snaps</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just get out will you, I really can&#39;t be bothered with you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and run my hands through my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You never cheated on Stephanie and you never would have,&#34; Carl said &#34;what makes Megan different? You need to ask yourself that,&#34; and then I hear a door slam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes water and tears fall it seems my brain had only just now registered what he had done and just how much it hurt. I bury my head into my knees and wrap my arms around myself and cry. My body hurt as I cried, I couldn&#39;t forgive him for this, it hurt like hell and it was because of him. Because he couldn&#39;t just put with having an argument with me he had to also put me in pain. If I did forgive him what would happen when we next have an argument if he&#39;s gone and done this on our first real argument?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wipe my eyes and take out my phone to text Carl.</p>
