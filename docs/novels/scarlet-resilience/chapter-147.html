                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck is going on?&#34; he snaps. I move off Logan, wrapping the sheet around me. Logan reaches for his boxers. I gulp as my fear tries to take hold of me. &#34;I won&#39;t ask again,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just calm down,&#34; Logan says, getting up off the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the hell are you telling to calm down?&#34; My uncle moves towards Logan and I see it happen before it does. Brett punches Logan square in the face. &#34;Who the fuck do you think you are fucking my daughter?&#34; he shouts at Logan. &#34;You fucking pervert,&#34; he yells.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frown at what he says. I heard that right. That wasn&#39;t my brain playing tricks on me. It&#39;s my uncle who is stood in front of me right now trying to beat up my boyfriend. It&#39;s my uncle who just called me his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan dodges another blow but my uncle hits him in the stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it,&#34; I yell. Logan doesn&#39;t fight back and I know it&#39;s because of me. I grab Logan&#39;s t-shirt and pull it on and go to pull my uncle away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll kill you,&#34; he snarls as he pushes me away and then goes back to hitting Logan. It is then David walks in. He walks up to my uncle and wraps his arm around his neck and drags him out of my room. &#34;Get the hell off me,&#34; he snaps. I look at Logan to see his nose is bleeding and by the look of things his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wiping the tears from my cheeks, I walk towards Logan who is laid on the floor. I kneel to him and grab the sheet to hold it to his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I cry, and then I hear footsteps. I look behind us to see Melanie, Yasmin, and Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve had worse,&#34; Logan states, and wipes his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you fight back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not what was needed,&#34; he states, and moves to wipe a tear from my cheek. &#34;Plus I doubt that&#39;s what you would want,&#34; I smile in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Melanie walks over to us with a wet flannel. I thank her and hold it to his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just keep getting beaten up today,&#34; Carl states. &#34;First you get beaten up by a girl and now you&#39;ve gotten beaten up by said girl&#39;s uncle,&#34; he states. I glare at Carl, &#34;Let&#39;s hope he hasn&#39;t ruined your pretty face,&#34; he says, and tilts his head at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up Carl,&#34; we all say at once. He laughs and walks out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan gets up and sits on the bed. He places his hand in mine and looks up at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; he asks. I nod and look down. &#34;You heard what he called you?&#34; he asks. I nod which means it wasn&#39;t my mind playing tricks on me, he heard it too. I look at Melanie and Yasmin to see them frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should go talk to him, shouldn&#39;t I?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, that&#39;ll be the best thing to do,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m scared, what if he gets angry at me?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;David is down there, he wouldn&#39;t let anything happen to you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod and pick up my tracksuit bottoms pulling them on underneath his t-shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay up here,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods and l walk out of my room and down the stairs and it&#39;s then I can hear him. He sounds so angry. I follow his voice into the kitchen and stand at the door to see him pacing back and forth near the sink. He looks towards me and frowns and then looks away. David walks towards me and steps behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be out here,&#34; he says with a yawn and stands just outside the kitchen. Most likely to stop Brett from running upstairs and attacking Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk to the island counter and sit down facing him. The counter is the only thing separating us. I&#39;m not even sure how I start this conversation or even explain to him that what he&#39;s thinking isn&#39;t true. But he just caught me having sex with my teacher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s your teacher,&#34; he states breaking the silence between us. He&#39;s not facing me, his whole body is turned to the kitchen sink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yes,&#34; my voice is small, I know if he wanted he&#39;d be able to take David and then get up the stairs and kill Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s a lot older than you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;7 years,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just turned 18,&#34; I say nothing at that, granted I turned 18 in February and it&#39;s the middle of May. &#34;I should have noticed this, it was weird from the get-go, I knew something was off about him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not him,&#34; I say, and that&#39;s when he turns to me. &#34;None of this is against my will, he hasn&#39;t done anything to me,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re 18 and you&#39;ve been through hell, he&#39;s taking advantage,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he isn&#39;t,&#34; I snap and wipe the tears from my cheeks. &#34;He isn&#39;t the one that initiated this, I did, I like him, he makes me happy and he would never hurt me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s your god damn teacher Megan,&#34; he snaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know and I don&#39;t care, please just try to understand,&#34; I say looking at him and he frowns at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You love him,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and look down at my hands. I wipe my cheeks again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The last person I loved used it against me, I vowed to never love anyone ever again, family, friend or partner,&#34; I say looking at him. &#34;So I hope that whatever it is I&#39;m feeling for him isn&#39;t love but something greater and better,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; is all he says, and then walks around the island counter to sit next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All I know is that he makes me happy, he makes me feel like me again and I think I deserve that,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do, I just, there&#39;s so many obstacles to come for you, it&#39;s going to be difficult,&#34; he states</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s already been difficult, he has put up with so much from me, my mood swings aren&#39;t great, when I have nightmares he feels so powerless and I can see him getting annoyed with himself, then there&#39;s his uncle that just didn&#39;t want us to be together because he hates him. So whatever we come across I know we&#39;ll find a way around it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If this becomes public he&#39;ll be taken from you,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t become public, he has handed in his resignation, he will do the rest of the year and then he&#39;s going to England,&#34; I say looking at him. &#34;I&#39;m going with him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; he starts</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s not much here for me Brett, he&#39;s all I have and I&#39;m happy with that,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your friends?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said he can fly them out to see me whenever I or they want,&#34; he frowns at me, &#34;He&#39;s like a millionaire, he only went into teaching because he wanted to do it, he&#39;s going back to England to take over the family business,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighs and looks away from me, his hands move to his face and he rubs his eye before turning back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He looks after me,&#34; I reassure him. &#34;Have you not noticed he does everything I want to do? I get to pick everything we do, eat, watch, the man treats me like a princess,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just trying to think what your mom would say about all of this,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think she&#39;d give me a high five,&#34; I say, and he laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably,&#34; he pauses and looks at me, &#34;It&#39;s going to take me time to accept this,&#34; he says, and I nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence weaves into the room as I sit looking at him. I want to ask him what he meant upstairs. He called me his daughter, that&#39;s confusing as hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; He asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Upstairs you called me your daughter &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did,&#34; I frown at him. &#34;That&#39;s because you are,&#34; he pauses and gets up. &#34;I&#39;ll be back in a minute,&#34; he states, and walks out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear David stop him and then he tells him not to worry. I sigh and get up to get myself a drink of water. David walks in and starts to fill a jug up with water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, just confused,&#34; I say, and down my glass of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gives me a small smile and then my uncle returns. He sits down and then looks at me. I walk over and sit down next to him. David walks out of the room as Brett hands me a piece of paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mother and I had an affair, I was in love with her, to be honest. She met Jonathon when she was 16 and her circumstances at home weren&#39;t great so she moved out with him pretty quickly. I met her a year later and I was just in love with her,&#34; he explains. I open the piece of paper to see its a paternity test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I read it as it tells me that Jonathon isn&#39;t my father but my uncle, and Brett is my biological father. I look at him and he gives me a small smile before looking away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand,&#34; I say quietly. Why would my mother not tell me this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Louise and Jonathan had an argument one night and she left him, I told her she could stay with me as I was renting a place temporarily and there was an extra room. And well I don&#39;t really need to explain what happened, but 9 months later you were born. She told me for the first five years that you weren&#39;t mine. I think she was scared of Jonathon because she did love him. I confessed my feelings to her and she got angry. She told me to get over them,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would she do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think she felt that she owed him because he got her out of the situation with her family and he&#39;d paid for her to go to college, she just didn&#39;t want to hurt him I guess, it was only when I get a paternity test done myself did I find out,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you say anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She begged me not to, and she told me she didn&#39;t love me, yet we would sleep together whenever I came back home,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that why you would stay with us?&#34; I ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes and no, I stayed because Jonathon would always offer as I don&#39;t get on with your grandad and because I wanted to be near you, I was able to watch you grow and be near you both,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see,&#34; I say looking down at the piece of paper in my hands. I&#39;m not sure how to feel about this. The fact he&#39;s my father and not Jonathon makes me happy but also a little sad. Jonathon was amazing the first 14years of my life, he was like my best friend. &#34;Did Jonathon know?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, your mother told him the day she died,&#34; he pauses, &#34;she planned on leaving him, that night she wasn&#39;t on her way to pick you up, she was on her way to me,&#34; he states. I stand up and walk away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jonathan said to the police that she was coming to pick me up,&#34; I state as I stand near the sink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wrote him a letter that night explaining she was leaving him for me, that you weren&#39;t his and that she was taking you with her,&#34; he states. &#34;She called me from the car and told me to pick you up, that she&#39;d packed you a bag and that she&#39;d meet us both at the motel I was staying at,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He made me think it was my fault,&#34; I say quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No he chased her in the car and she ended up running a red light because of him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But a drunk driver hit her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah he did but if Jonathon hadn&#39;t chased her in his car she wouldn&#39;t have run the red light and the drunk driver would have never hit her,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He killed her because she wanted to leave him,&#34; I say, and feel myself cry. He gets up and comes to hug me. He wraps his arms around me and I can&#39;t help but push him away. &#34;I hate him, he has taken everything from me,&#34; I cry and walk out of the kitchen, I walk straight into Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything ok?&#34; He asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; Brett calls and stops behind me once he notices Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Logan asks me. I look at him, his nose has stopped bleeding and it looks like it&#39;s starting to bruise. He moves his hands to my arms and gives me a little shake I blink and look down as I feel myself cry more. He wipes the tears from my cheeks and pulls me into a hug. &#34;Whatever it is, it&#39;ll be ok,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He took everything from me, Logan,&#34; I cry. He holds me tighter and it&#39;s what I need.</p>
