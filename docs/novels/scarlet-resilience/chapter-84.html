                <p>After putting the bandage on I rub the moisturiser on her back. She may not notice it but the scars on her back weren&#39;t as strong as they were when we first started putting this on her back. I know she hates them and I know she thinks they&#39;re the ugliest thing in the world but to me it&#39;s part of her beauty. They show how strong she is and I love that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we not do anything today?&#34; she asks. &#34;I know you brought us here to work on our relationship but I just want to stay in bed and watch movies,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On your own or...&#34; I said and she smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With you but if you don&#39;t want to that&#39;s fine I can watch them on my own,&#34; she explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan I&#39;ll sit with you and watch a movie,&#34; I state and she smiles. There&#39;s then a knock on the door, I get up and open the door to see Catherine the maid that&#39;s pregnant holding a tray with mine and Megan&#39;s breakfast on it. I take the tray from her and glare at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t look at me like that, I&#39;m not an invalid,&#34; she said and I smile. &#34;Enjoy your breakfast,&#34; she said, smiling at me then leaving. I shut the door and place the tray on the bed. Megan picks up one of the plates and a knife and folk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you enjoy being waited on?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surprisingly yes, I didn&#39;t like it when I was younger but now I sort of like it but only a little,&#34; I said with a small smile. &#34;The thing is they&#39;re always doing it because when I&#39;m not here this is used as a holiday resort. All of the rooms apart from this one and the one Carl is in are used by other people,&#34; I explain &#34;people book to stay here and then use things here that they&#39;ve paid for, only certain places in the mansion that they can&#39;t go,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ohh so it&#39;s like a business as well as a home,&#34; she says. I nod and she smiles as I sit next to her and take the other plate. &#34;So how much would you say you made a year?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After paying other people about 15 Million,&#34; I said and her jaw drops &#34;but half of that goes to charities and plus the people that run my businesses for me have to buy shares,&#34; I pause &#34;I&#39;m an unknown owner, I try my best not to have anything to do with any of it, I&#39;m only doing it because it was left in my parents will for me to take over and being a silent owner is the only way I can fulfil their request,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I understand that,&#34; she says. &#34;What if one day you become bankrupt?&#34; she asks and I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That will never happen, the world would have ended by the time I become bankrupt,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is that?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I have my wage from teaching which is pretty ok for me to live, I own parts of pretty much every type of company as in retail and the food industry, I own an airline, about four other houses that are used the same as this one, I think they&#39;ve just launched a phone I&#39;m not too sure I know nothing about most of this. We run insurance too,&#34; I said, frowning and she smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t seem very sure,&#34; Megan says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not, I know nothing really,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan wraps his arms around me and kisses my neck. I move away from him, we&#39;re watching Harry Potter and it seems he&#39;s getting bored of it. I move my hands to his and then turn to look at him. He moves a finger to my jaw and leans in and kisses me. His hand moves to the back of my neck and through my hair. He pulls me forward and moves his arms around my body. I pull back and he starts to kiss my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I snap and push him away. I get up off the bed and here him sigh in frustration. I glare at him and walk off into the bathroom to calm down. I had already moved away from him didn&#39;t that tell him I wanted to watch the movie and not make out with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking in the mirror reminded me why I don&#39;t want him kissing me. I don&#39;t feel attractive one bit at this moment in time. I have a bruised nose and around my eyes. My hand was still cut and my head hurt. I take a deep breath and run the hot water of the tap, I rinse the water over my face and then let out my breath . I pat my face dry and then take a quick look in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open the bathroom door to see Logan sat with a pink bag. He looks at me and smiles then looks away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he said &#34;My excuse is I&#39;m a man and sometimes my penis takes over,&#34; he said and looks at me &#34;that&#39;s the honest truth no point telling you anything different,&#34; he said and I look away from him &#34;I have a present for you,&#34; he said holding a pink bag up to me. I walk towards him and take the bag. &#34;I got Melanie, Yasmin and Julie to get it all while we were here,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look in the bag to see two types of foundation a gel eyeliner and some concealor and a primer. I sit on the bed and pour the contents out on the bed. I look at them and smile to myself and feel myself start to cry a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You bought all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I gave them the money and told them to get you some make up, I didn&#39;t get it though,&#34; I look at him and he frowns. &#34;Why are you crying?&#34; he asks leaning forward and wiping the tear that dropped down my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lean forward and hug him, I kiss his cheek and hug him as tight as I can. His hands move to my waist gently stroking up and down my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I said and decide not to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re happy but you may actually murder me because I&#39;m finding it quite hard to breath,&#34; he says. I let go of him and pick up the makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to put it on now because this is heavy makeup this will cover these bruises,&#34; I said and sit in front of the mirror. He leans back and puts his hand behind his head as he watches Harry Potter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about fifteen minutes I&#39;m finished. I look at Logan to see him take his top off and then start to unbutton his jeans. I frown at him and he looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was thinking about going out? Do you want to go out?&#34; he asks as he stands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm...&#34; I start and look in the mirror &#34;yeah,&#34; I said with a small smile &#34;I feel like going out,&#34; I said and look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you would,&#34; he said and I frown at him as he walks into the wardrobe. I look back in the mirror and open my make up bag. The make up the girls had got me is a very good brand and I used that a lot even though it&#39;s expensive. It&#39;s make up that is made to cover scars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock sounds at the door and I look and call for them to come in. In walks Yasmin, Carl, Julie, Brendan and Scott.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re wondering if we can actually do something today,&#34; Yasmin states and sits down next to me. I watch the others sit on the bed. Carl looks at Logan&#39;s clothes and frowns then looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s getting changed before you start saying anything,&#34; I said and he smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I really that predictable?&#34; he asks and I nod causing him to pout and look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan walks out of the wardrobe in a pair of black jeans, he looks at them and then at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we having a meeting or something?&#34; he asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No an orgy,&#34; Carl said and I smile &#34;We&#39;re all riding you first,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Shut up Carl. We want to go somewhere,&#34; Julie says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just saying to Megan we should go out, you all can come too, I&#39;m just not decided on where to go,&#34; he states. &#34;We&#39;ll have something to eat and then we can see where we&#39;re going ok?&#34; he asks. They nod and get up off the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the age limit here for drinking?&#34; Julie asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;18,&#34; Logan said &#34;but I own a few clubs so we can go there until we&#39;ve gotten the fake ID&#39;s done,&#34; he said and we look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been told they should be done by tomorrow,&#34; Carl said looking at him, he then turns and look at us &#34;Why can&#39;t you all be legal that way you can do much better things,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it just me or is it weird that it&#39;s the girls that are underage here not the men,&#34; Scott says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes but unfortunately for you you&#39;re the only one that looks underage because of your height,&#34; I said mindlessly. They laugh and I frown and look at them from the mirror and then I realise what I&#39;ve said. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; I said looking at him and he looks down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You all act as if I&#39;m about four foot I&#39;m not I&#39;m over 5ft I&#39;m just not in the double digits when it comes to the inches part,&#34; he said sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I bet you make up for your height in your trousers,&#34; Julie said and I shake my head. &#34;For all we know Logan could have a tiny one and you have one that knocks against your knee,&#34; I laugh and so does everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julie, you will say anything to try and get me to show you my piece won&#39;t you,&#34; Logan said with a small smirk and she smiled. I smile at them and Logan walks towards me and sits down on the buffet. &#34;Now all of you get out,&#34; he said and they walked out. He moves his arms around my waist and kisses my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for getting them to get me these,&#34; I said touching the makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem as long as it makes you happy,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because it&#39;s the mineral make up that covers scars I&#39;ll be able to cover my back which means I can wear a strapless dress and my arms and legs,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your legs?&#34; he asks. I sigh and look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a few cuts and scratches on my legs,&#34; I said and he sighs and his grip loosens on my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For crying out loud,&#34; he mutters but I hear him. &#34;Why? And when?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you not know?&#34; he snaps and by his tone I can tell he didn&#39;t want to snap at me. He sighs again and rests his head on my back. &#34;Sorry I don&#39;t mean to snap at you, it&#39;s just when you don&#39;t tell me these things and then I find out I feel so useless and I feel like I&#39;ve been no help to you,&#34; he explains and I look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan lets go of me and stands up. I look at him and watch him walk into the wardrobe and then walk back out pulling a t-shirt over his head. &#34;I need to make a few calls so I&#39;ll see you at dinner,&#34; he says and walks out of the room. I sigh and put my make up away.</p>
