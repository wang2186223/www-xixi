                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he asks, walking towards me and sitting next to me &#34;babe,&#34; he said moving an arm around me and resting his hand on my leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You understand how hard it was for me to forgive you? Don&#39;t you?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he said, frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good because I can&#39;t forgive you if you hurt me like that again,&#34; I said and he nods &#34;and please don&#39;t think I can forget what you&#39;ve done just like that,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I know it&#39;s going to take a while for you to trust me again with anything,&#34; he said and I look down. He kisses the top of my head and rests his head on my shoulder. &#34;Come down when you&#39;re ready ok,&#34; he said and stands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take his hand and stand; he looks at me and smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t stay up here all day,&#34; I said and walk with him out of the room and as I walk down the stairs I see Carl opening the front door and stood there is Brendan. A smile goes across my face and I let go of Logan&#39;s hand and run down to him. I jump up and wrap my legs around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I&#39;ve missed you too,&#34; he said in my ear hugging me back. I pull back and jump down to my feet. &#34;Are you ok he asks?&#34; I nod and he frowns and I shake my head causing him to sigh. I give him a small smile and hook my arm with his. We walk into the living room with Carl and Logan behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;ve you been?&#34; I ask him and he looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had to go to the doctors for a blood test,&#34; he said and I frown at him &#34;it&#39;s nothing to worry about,&#34; he said and I look away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good,&#34; I said and walk into the dining room &#34;I&#39;m going to go help Logan,&#34; I said and unhook my arm from his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan gives me a small smile as I walk into the kitchen and start to plate up the vegetables. My eyes slowly narrow on him as I watch him cut the chicken and place it on the wooden chopping board burning his fingers at the same time. I smile and place the bowl of mixed baked vegetables on the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit,&#34; I hear him say. I look to see he had burnt his fingers again and was now wiping them on the kitchen towel. I laugh and look away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you wait for it to cool?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who wants to eat cold chicken? I know I don&#39;t, I only eat cold chicken if it&#39;s left over&#39;s,&#34; he said and continues to cut the chicken breasts and burn himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pick it out with the bed of the knife, you won&#39;t burn yourself as much and it&#39;ll be quicker,&#34; I said and he turns to look at me. I roll my eyes and take the knife off him. I cut the breast up and then slide the knife underneath it and pick it up using my thumb and index finger to support it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry Jaime Oliver,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s a chef in Britain does all that cheffy stuff,&#34; he said and I smirk a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well when you have had to cook dinner for a psychotic father you tend to pick up a few things,&#34; I said and I feel his hands move around me as I carry on doing his job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he always make you cook?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I had to cook his dinner and only his, I was pretty much only allowed into the kitchen at that time. I wasn&#39;t allowed to make myself anything. That is why when I was at yours I ask  you if you were serious about me making myself something because it had been a while since I had made myself something,&#34; I explain and feel him softly kiss my neck. &#34;It wasn&#39;t that bad, until I started putting sleeping tablets in his food. He found out after a week though that&#39;s what made cooking bad after that because then I had to make dinner in front of him,&#34; I explain and Logan holds me tighter as if protectively. I smile to myself and kiss his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do the vegetables then,&#34; he said and walks off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few hours pass and we&#39;re sat in the games room. Yasmin, Julie, Scott and James had gone home so it was just me, Logan, Melanie, Brendan and Carl. Melanie was on the phone to her boyfriend, Brendan and Carl are playing Halo 3 and I&#39;m sat on Logan&#39;s lap on my laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan leans over and looks at what I&#39;m doing. I was on facebook. I rarely updated my facebook it was weird to see how much people had changed and how much people was obsessed with telling other people what they are doing. I mean really do I really want to know that you&#39;re boyfriend just did something that wasn&#39;t hilarious but you found hilarious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have facebook?&#34; I ask Logan, he nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only go on it on my phone though I think I have about four friends,&#34; he says. I smirk a little and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still haven&#39;t accepted me,&#34; Carl says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie that Laura has another boyfriend,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I know apparently it&#39;s some guy who was in college. He dropped out or something and apparently he&#39;s the one,&#34; she said and I smile &#34;again, she&#39;s always saying that her boyfriends are the one it&#39;s annoying,&#34; Melanie said a little disgusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Logan to see him on his phone. I kiss his neck causing him to look at me with a sceptical look. I smile and pout at him for a kiss. He leans in and pecks my lips and then looks back at his phone. What was so exciting on that phone of his?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have 169 friend requests,&#34; he said and I smirk a little. &#34;I don&#39;t think I know 169 people,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me see,&#34; I said holding out my hand. He hands me his phone and I look through the friend requests to see some from our school. &#34;Courtney&#39;s added you,&#34; I said and look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a shame for her, she has to be out of school for at least 5 years before I can accept that,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah and for a teacher to date a student the student has to be out of education for 5 years unless they go to college then they have to have been out of that for two years and go to a college out of that state,&#34; he said and looks at me with a small smirk. &#34;You are 5 years too young,&#34; he said and leans close to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a little extreme,&#34; I said and his smirk stays as he moves my head to face him with his index finger under my chin. &#34;I guess you&#39;re a naughty boy,&#34; I said quietly and he kisses me. I smile as I kiss him back feeling his smirk still there. He has one hell of a sexy smirk and he seemed to know it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands move up to the back of his neck and through his dark brown soft hair. I lift up my laptop and pull back. I place my laptop on the floor and lean in to him. His hand moves up my skirt as our kiss deepens. Our bodies press to each other becoming more intimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you both go upstairs and do that?&#34; I hear Carl say. I giggle and pull away, Logan doesn&#39;t though and leans back in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Melanie said a little bitterly &#34;go to your fricking room and frisk each other,&#34; she snaps. I pull back and sigh while shaking my head. Logan pulls back fully and looks at Melanie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t want to go upstairs if you don&#39;t like it leave,&#34; I snap back and Logan looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need a drink,&#34; he said quickly and moves me up and stands. I sit back in the chair and watch him leave. I didn&#39;t understand why she was being a bitch. I had forgiven him and yeah I understand she was angry too but if she was a true friend she&#39;d leave it be and just be there for me if it did all go wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too,&#34; Brendan said walking out of the room too. I watch Melanie said bye to her boyfriend and then look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m off home then,&#34; she said and walks out of the room. I sigh and look up at the ceiling I wasn&#39;t going to go after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tension,&#34; Carl said in a high pitch voice. I look at him and he walks over towards me &#34;here&#39;s how I see it poppet,&#34; he said and I frown at his new nickname for me &#34;yes you&#39;re friend is being a bit of a bitch but who can blame her and if we don&#39;t go into the kitchen in the next minute or so Brendan may come out of that kitchen in a body bag,&#34; he said and I sigh &#34;don&#39;t be so sad poppet,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Poppet, really Carl,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How else can I make you smile, I mean there is another way but bending you over and making you scream my name won&#39;t be very healthy for me afterwards, what with Logan and all that,&#34; he pauses, &#34;he could join us though,&#34; I roll my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is sex all you think about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really need to ask that Poppet?&#34; he asks and watches me stand. I giggle and walk out of the games room with him behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stand behind the door to the kitchen listening to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My sister can be too much sometimes,&#34; Brendan said, obviously trying to make conversation with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, it&#39;s not that she&#39;s too much it&#39;s more the fact she hates me,&#34; Logan said &#34;I&#39;m not really your family&#39;s biggest fan, your mother is my psychiatrist which must be a big pain for her, I broke your arm and I cheated on your sisters best friend all I need to do now is something that will affect your father then we got full hate Logan household,&#34; Logan says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You obviously haven&#39;t seen my mother&#39;s other patients, one guy had an erotic dream about her and tried to kill himself because she didn&#39;t feel anything for him,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why she&#39;s always telling me off for my sexual advances towards her when we had sessions. I do only do it to annoy her though don&#39;t think I&#39;m trying to do your mother,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know it&#39;s hard for him to said sorry right?&#34; Carl states to me in a whispered tone. I nod and look down. I knew that I really did but I knew that if he did said it then it meant he was willing to do it for me. Brendan is my friend and what Logan had done was wrong.</p>
