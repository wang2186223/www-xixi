                <p>Megan</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan&#39;s hands move through my hair as I take his dick in my hand. I slowly move my hand up and down, moving my thumb over the tip every time I move my hand up. I move my hand out of his boxers and pull them down a little more. He breaks away from our kiss and moves his hand to the shirt I&#39;m wearing. He unbuttons it a little and I look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you just want to get me naked again,&#34; I ask with a small smile. He smirks and kisses my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like looking and feeling your body,&#34; he says in my ear and he squeezes my boobs. I move my hand back to his dick and kiss his neck. I trace kisses up his neck a nibble on his ear lobe and then lick just under his ear. I like this. I&#39;m the one in control of everything. I feel like I can stop whenever I want and I control how he feels. There&#39;s something about being on top that makes me feel powerful. I like it a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel his hand move onto my hand and he guides my hand over his penis. I feel him squeeze my hand making me squeeze him gently and move my hand faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that better?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; he says with his eyes closed. I smile and kiss his neck again. I move back on him a little. His hands move back up to my chest. I move my legs off him and kneel in between his legs. He looks at me and I lean in and kiss him. I move my hand from his manhood and I pull back from his kiss to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never done this,&#34; I say and he frowns at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Done what?&#34; he asks confusion clear on his face. I smile a little and move down &#34;You don&#39;t have to do that,&#34; he says as I take him into my mouth. I feel his legs go a little stiff and I pull back and move my hand around the base of his penis and move my mouth back down onto him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is the truth I&#39;ve never done this before and right now I&#39;m going on what I&#39;ve read in cosmopolitan when I was like 15 that is if I can remember it all. What I do remember is not to bite or use teeth in general.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Licking up his shaft I suck on his tip and take him back into my mouth. I pull back and swirl my tongue around his tip and kiss down his penis. I start to move my hand over his penis again and then take him back into my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jesus,&#34; he breathes and then moves his hips toward my mouth &#34;Megan I&#39;ll come if you carry this on,&#34; he says and I feel his hand move though my hair down to my back. I pull back and wipe my mouth a little and look at him. He looks like he&#39;s expecting me to say something and I don&#39;t know what. I just kiss his neck and massage him with my hand again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel his hands move round to my chest and one move down to my panties. His hand moves inside my panties and press against the nub of my clit. A moan escapes my throat unexpectedly. His finger makes a circular motion making the pleasure more intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I moan and squeeze the hair at the back of his head. He presses his lips to mine, his tongue sliding over mine. I can&#39;t help but moan in the kiss as his fingers continue their beautiful pleasure. I pull back and press my forehead to his, he moves his head a little and buries in my hair and neck. His fingers move further inside and move inside me, his thumb replacing the finger that teased the nub of my clit. I feel his breath on my neck as my hand wrapped around his c0ck matches the pace of his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; he says and the hand that was on my breast makes its way round my back and up into my hair. He pulls me away from him and kisses me again. I move up a little and move my hand down and up his chest to his jaw. He pulls away from the kiss &#34;I&#39;m gonna come,&#34; he says against my lips a presses his lips to mine. He pulls away and I wrap my arms around his neck and lay my head on his shoulder. I watch as my finger nails dig into his shoulder a little as I breathe in a moan and kiss his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too,&#34; I whisper and I can feel myself blush at my words. He kisses my shoulder as if to tell me that it&#39;s ok I feel this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding my thumb over his tip I feel his mouth nibble at my neck, I give his tip a little squeeze and move my hand faster. His fingers stop moving in and out of me but his thumb continues its dance over my clit. I can&#39;t control the sound coming from my mouth as he moves his thumb faster. His body goes tense as I nibble on his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel hotness on my stomach just as I orgasm. I can&#39;t help but clench his shoulder and say his name in his ear as I ride out my orgasm. He groans as his continues. He slowly moves his fingers out of me once I relax against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a minute or so once our breathing has calmed, I move back a little and look down to see he had released on my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; he says and I look at him. He moves a little and then reaches down the side of the bed for the hand towel he was using to dry his hands earlier. He gently wipes my stomach clean, I hold my hand out to him and he smiles at me and wipes my hand clean. Once my hand is free I move off him as he cleans himself. I get off the bed and button up his shirt that I&#39;m wearing. He looks at me and a smile creases his lips as I walk towards the bathroom. I feel him take my hand as I walk past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I ask. He pulls me down and kisses me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ok?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m fine,&#34; I say and give him a smile. I&#39;m better than fine. I&#39;m happy with myself, I&#39;m happy that I was able to get past a barrier with him and allow myself to be pleasured. I walk into the bathroom and wash my hands. He may have wiped them but they felt a little sticky. I take a quick glance at myself in the mirror to see my cheeks are red and my lips are quite puffed up and pink. I then look back at my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once washed I dry them and then look properly in the mirror to see my hair a bit of a mess. My eyes widen as I notice a love bite on my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I look to see he&#39;s stood at the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at what you&#39;ve done,&#34; I say turning to look at him. He tilts his head and smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the problem?&#34; he asks. I sigh and walk towards him. &#34;No one who shouldn&#39;t see it is going to see it, by the time we&#39;re back in America it will be gone,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True,&#34; I say and hug him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon we should sleep,&#34; he says and picks me up and leads me back into the bedroom to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan pulls back the cover and lays me down on the bed. He climbs in and moves his arms around my waist. He pulls away and turns the lamp out. I turn in his arms do I&#39;m not facing him, he&#39;s still quite warm which is surprising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you comfy?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very,&#34; I say and move my arms around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were you serious when you said you&#39;ve never gone down on a man before?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I say. &#34;Tyler and I never did that, one because I never felt comfortable doing that sort of thing more so when I caught him kissing Courtney and two he never tried to go down on me either,&#34; I say. &#34;Benjamin tried to force me to but I told him I&#39;d bite his dick off,&#34; he laughs and holds me tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good on you,&#34; he says &#34;what about Brendan and Carl?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was drunk with Brendan all we&#39;ve ever done is hand stuff and you knew about Carl?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, he told me you and him hooked up but that&#39;s it, he didn&#39;t go into detail which I was glad about but now I&#39;m sort of curious,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was the same as Brendan,&#34; I say and he kisses my cheek. &#34;It was also the first time someone has kissed me down there,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like that,&#34; he says and I laugh and move away from him to turn on the lamp at my side. I sit up and look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very,&#34; he says and pulls me by my hand to him and holds me tight to his chest so I&#39;m on top of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many girls have you done that to?&#34; I ask and he looks at me as if to say are you serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, not as many as I&#39;ve slept with, I mean if some girls look easy and cheap then no I don&#39;t bother, but I&#39;ve never had anything related to oral sex,&#34; he says and I pull a look of disgust. &#34;I once got crabs from Car. My eyes widen &#34;I put on his boxers once by accident after having a foursome worst time of my life I think,&#34; he says and I move away from him a little. &#34;Hey at least I&#39;m openly admitting this to you,&#34; he says. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t bother with any other girl,&#34; he says and I move off him and sit on the bed with my legs crossed while looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything else?2 I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chlamydia,&#34; he says &#34;but I used to get tested for it like every two months as in an agreement with Aunt and Uncle, so I caught it early,&#34; he explains. I look down and he moves his hand on my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get it,&#34; I say and look at him. &#34;You were bound to have had something given your past, you don&#39;t have anything now do you,&#34; and he frowns at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No why would you even ask that?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did sleep with Courtney&#39;s sister like two weeks ago,&#34; I state. He sighs and rolls his eyes and looks away from me and I frown at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should go to sleep,&#34; he says laying down and turning on his side so his back is to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious?&#34; I ask. &#34;You&#39;re actually going in a mood with me, you know that it&#39;s not something that just goes away, I&#39;m sorry for bringing it up I was just asking, I didn&#39;t bring it up to argue with you,&#34; I say. I sigh and turn the light off to go to sleep. After a few minutes I feel his hands go around my waist and he kisses my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s just something I want to forget about because I hate it,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I say quietly and move my hands onto his.</p>
