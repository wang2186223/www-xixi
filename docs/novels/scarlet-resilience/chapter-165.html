                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck did you do to her?&#34; I hear a distorted voice say. I open my eyes and feel pain radiate through my body. &#34;Why is she tied up?&#34; I hear the same distorted voice say. It&#39;s then I realise I&#39;m sitting on a chair with my hands tied behind my back. I feel someone jerk my hands, and then my arms loosen from behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s scrappy, you said she was just an average teenage girl, not that she is trained in combat,&#34; a voice from behind me says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hardly trained in combat,&#34; another distorted voice says from further away. I close my eyes tightly as I try to bring myself round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, my face and bruised ribs say different,&#34; the man says who I&#39;m guessing is Kidnapper A. I hear someone chuckle a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I feel a finger on my cheek. I try my best not to flinch and to come across still passed out. The person touching my face moves my hair behind my ear and then strokes I&#39;m guessing my bruised cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hit her,&#34; the distorted voice says, and I have the dreaded feeling that it&#39;s Jonathan. I told myself I&#39;d never let him touch me again, but right now, I need to bide my time if I want to leave here alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, well he picked her up and threw her into the ground, I&#39;m pretty sure that hurt her more than me punching her in the face,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were supposed to pick her up unharmed,&#34; the distorted voice snaps and I can hear the anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We didn&#39;t plan on hurting her, she wasn&#39;t easy, she&#39;s fast for one,&#34; Kidnapper A says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s telling the truth, we thought she would be quite easy, but when she rugby tackled him, we had to up our game,&#34; Kidnapper B states. The distorted voice sighs and then places his hand under my chin and forces my head up to him. I&#39;m going to call him Darth because he sounds eerily like Darth Vader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long until she wakes up?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shouldn&#39;t be too long,&#34; Kidnapper B says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darth lets go of me, my head drops. I open my eyes to see he&#39;s stood in front of me, I keep my head down looking at their feet. I see two pairs of feet behind him, and I can&#39;t see the other set of feet, but I know there&#39;s a minimum of four people in this room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can leave, go stand guard,&#34; Darth says. I move my eyes up Darth&#39;s legs, and I notice it can&#39;t be Jonathon, his legs are too long, and his thighs are too thick under the black jeans he&#39;s wearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear the door slam shut, and it&#39;s now I realise this is probably my only chance. I clench my fist and lung forward, tackling Darth to the ground. He drops, and I climb up his body and punch him in his covered face. He&#39;s wearing something that covers his eyes also with tinted plastic. I notice a knife in his black body warmer chest pocket. I take it out and hold it to his neck and look around the room to see two other people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay still, or I&#39;ll slit his fucking neck,&#34; I threaten. They stop in their tracks, and I feel my hand shaking as I hold it to his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down,&#34; the one to my left says with his hands up in surrender. His voice is distorted too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am calm, now why am I here,&#34; I snap and I can feel myself start to sweat. I look around again to see I&#39;m in a dark abandoned warehouse. I feel Darth&#39;s hand on my thigh, I look down at him and press the knife to his neck again. &#34;Move your hand,&#34; he moves his hands up to his head, so he&#39;s in the same stance as the other two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not going to hurt you,&#34; the left one says. I look around again, and from the darkness, I&#39;m guessing I was out for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not getting the chance,&#34; I say and press the blade of the knife against Darth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Darth hits my arm, knocking the knife from my hand and flips me off him. I stand and stagger a little as I still feel the effects of the drug in me. I get myself ready for an attack. I decide I&#39;m not going to give them a chance and I run forward, skid between his legs and turn to kick his legs out from under him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I notice the one on the right hasn&#39;t moved; he just stands watching. Left runs towards me, and Darth holds his hand up, stopping him. I smirk and go to kick him, he blocks me with his arms and then grabs my leg. I hop on one foot and then jump up to backflip, narrowly missing hitting him under the chin. I land on all fours and turn around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wildly I look around for an exit. It&#39;s too dark to see, there&#39;s only one light, and that&#39;s the light above us, and it doesn&#39;t light the whole warehouse. There&#39;s only one, and from the conversation earlier Kidnapper A and B are out there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe I should have kept the zip ties on,&#34; Darth states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think,&#34; the guy to the left says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frown at Darth and look around again, the knife is too far away, and the only thing available is the wooden chair I was sat on. I grab it and pick it up, breaking it to use one of the legs as a weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Somebody trained you well.&#34; Darth states. I shrug and then run towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blocks all of my attacks, and I can feel myself getting tired. I have a feeling that these people don&#39;t want to hurt me. This Darth guy has been on the defence the entire time. By the size of him, he could probably take me out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darth grabs my makeshift weapon and pulls it towards him, making me fall into him. He grabs me and pins both arms behind my back and holds me tightly to him, and a familiar scent fills my nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough,&#34; he orders as his body presses against mine. &#34;And stop aiming for the face,&#34; he says. I frown and struggle to get out of his grip. His arm is over my shoulders. I look at his wrist, and I notice the watch he&#39;s wearing. It seems like Logans, but Logan wouldn&#39;t do this to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stamp my foot on him, but he doesn&#39;t budge. I scream and bite down on his arm as hard as I can, breaking through his long sleeve black top and then skin. He lets go, and I spin round and move my arms around his neck and squeeze. I nudge his knee, making him drop down onto one knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s then; I hear laughing. I look around to see it&#39;s not the guy on the left or the right of me. The laughter comes from in front of me, but I can&#39;t see anything because of the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lights switch on one by one, slowly revealing the rest of the warehouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was never one to listen, she needs a good beating,&#34; and that voice makes me freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonathan is hanging by his arms about 50 feet away. I let go of Darth and step back. The guy that has stayed silent this whole time walks up to him attaches a wire to him and presses something on the ground. Jonathon&#39;s body convulses, and he groans in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one said you could speak,&#34; Right man says, and it&#39;s then I notice Jonathon is only in a pair of jeans, dry blood covers his body, and he&#39;s got two black eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darth stands and then grabs me. I look up at him, I don&#39;t know how I know, but I know he&#39;s looking down at me, and he&#39;s trying to tell me it&#39;s ok.</p>
