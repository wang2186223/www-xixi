                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan has no idea what she does to me, what her body, mind and touch does for me. Just having her in the same room as me gives me a sense of stability. The fact she&#39;s ok with who I am, what I am even is the biggest relief to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I walked into her room to check on her earlier it broke my heart, the image of her in the arms of Brendon just crushed me. I didn&#39;t think I could have felt as bad as I already did until I saw her then. The fact she wouldn&#39;t see me when I got back from the hospital was a blow to me. I wanted nothing more than to hold her and feel her heart beating against mine. God knows when I had heard from David that she had cut herself my mind went into overdrive. Now she&#39;s in my arms sleeping perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hold her tightly to my chest as I look up at the ceiling. We moved to the couch after our talk. What I told her I had never told anyone, the only people that knew about it was David and my Uncle and they only knew so that they could cover it up. I never told my uncle why I did what I did mostly because I was ashamed of telling him. David had gotten it out of me when we were boxing together. He had told me I should have finished him off but I know he said that in jest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door to the room opens taking me out of my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I hear David call. I hold up my hand to show him where I am. He comes into sight and looks at Megan who is laid with her head on my chest and an arm over me. One of her legs in laced with mine. We had just talked about mindless stuff to relieve the tension in the room and as we spoke she fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I ask him. He sighs at me and walks towards the fireplace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a lady in here you should keep the room warm,&#34; he says he lights the fireplace to illuminate the room in a golden glow. I smile slightly and shift under Megan. &#34;Did you tell her then?&#34; he asks nows standing up and looking at us. I look at Megan and move hair from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I did,&#34; I say and slowly but carefully move from under her so I don&#39;t wake her. &#34;She took it better than I expected,&#34; I inform and he smiles &#34;she got angry, I&#39;ve never actually seen the side of her I saw today. She shouted at me and swore at me, she even called me a douche,&#34; I say frowning and he smiles and walks towards the desk to open the laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone needed to,&#34; he says sitting down at the desk. &#34;Are you back together?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She kissed me so I&#39;m guessing we are,&#34; I answer and walk towards the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never guess Logan, you hurt her, you are not back together until she confirms it, a kiss means nothing when you&#39;re arguing with the person you love, it can be out of vulnerability or emotional horniness,&#34; he says with a small smirk and looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told her about Jackson,&#34; I say and try to gauge his reaction to it. He leans back in the chair and looks up at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I told her why I was in hospital, I didn&#39;t tell her what drug,&#34; I add.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you feel about that?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, she told me she still wants me so I guess I&#39;m happy about it,&#34; I pause &#34;I just hope I don&#39;t have to tell her everything I have done, I don&#39;t think I could,&#34; I admit and look towards her to see her still asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve sorted the arrangements for when you&#39;re back in America,&#34; he says and starts to click away on the laptop. I walk round the desk to the laptop and look at it. &#34;I need you to confirm the men that I&#39;ve chosen and then we can get it sorted,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I say and watch him open all the necessary files.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should get some rest, the rest of the house will be up soon,&#34; he says getting up. &#34;I&#39;ll lock this door behind me, you know where the spare key is right?&#34; he asks. I nod, &#34;And if anyone asks me I&#39;ll tell them you&#39;ve gone out for the day, as for Miss Wright,&#34; he says and looks at her &#34;well I can always say you took her with you so you both could talk,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I say and watch him walk towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And remember, be a gentleman,&#34; he says and walks out. I roll my eyes at him and look at the laptop screen. David is the dad I should of had, he&#39;s always giving me advice or trying to push me into the right direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fast hard tapping wakes me. Stirring I open my eyes to a dimly lit room and the annoying tapping. I look at the source and it&#39;s Logan sat at the large desk on his laptop. Sitting up I move the blanket off me and walk over to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; I ask while yawning. He looks up at me as I walk round the desk. He closes a window on his laptop and I can tell by the redness in his eyes that he&#39;d been sat here a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wrapping my arms around his neck I kiss his cheek and then his ear. I&#39;m not going to lie, seeing him topless in the glow of the fireplace made me want him. I know now that when he touches me that it&#39;s going to be primarily for my pleasure. Somehow having his hands on me took away the pain of Benjamins hands and the memories entailed with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Work is what I&#39;m doing,&#34; he sighs and places his hand on mine. I smile and look at the computer to see a spreadsheet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well stop working,&#34; I order as I move my hands over his chest. He looks up at me and moves a hand up to cup my cheek. Leaning in he presses his lips to mine and slowly moves his hand up through my hair and then pulls me down to him so I fall onto his lap. I giggle and feel him move his other arm under my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you&#39;re up, I will stop working,&#34; he says pulling away and looking down at me, his blue eyes glistening with the reflection of the fire. I turn to his laptop and close the lid and then wrap both of my arms around his neck as he stands with me in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why haven&#39;t you slept?&#34; I ask looking up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had to answer a few emails and check a few proposals,&#34; he says and lays me back on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going back to sleep,&#34; I say and the right side of his mouth tilts up into a sexy smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re not,&#34; he responds pressing his lip to mine. I move back on the couch to give him room to get on too. He pulls back from the kiss and looks down at me. His knees between my legs and his hands flat at the side of my head. He stares down at me as he holds himself up and away from me. &#34;I want you to do something for me,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I ask frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise me that when we are with each other you tell me exactly what you want?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what you mean,&#34; I say and move my hands to his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to always tell me what you want sexually,&#34; he says and I feel myself blush at how straightforward he&#39;s being. &#34;I&#39;ll be the same way for you as well,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise,&#34; I say and a small smile forms on that perfect face of his. &#34;Why?&#34; I ask after a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I can always pleasure you,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I tell you what I want right now?&#34; I ask and he nods. &#34;I want you to kiss me and a little bit more,&#34; I say moving my hands down to the waistband of his bottoms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm, I think I can manage that, but let me tell you what I want,&#34; he states and I tilt my head at him. &#34;I want to kiss you but also - he moves a hand down to my top and moves it up slightly- I want to take this off and maybe these,&#34; he says moving a finger to the waistband of my bottoms. &#34;Is that ok with you?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is definitely ok with me,&#34; I say and move up to him. He meets me half way and kisses me. I moan into the kiss as I feel his body weight in between my legs. I have to admit I love the feeling of his body against mine, he never puts all his weight on me or ever too much, it&#39;s like he knows how much my mind can handle.</p>
