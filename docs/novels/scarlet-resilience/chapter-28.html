                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly kissed him back and moved my hands around his neck. He then pulled back then kissed me again quickly and his hands moved up and down my back. My lips parted nearly automatically when his tongue touched them. His hands touched mine and moved down my forearm and back up to my hands. He intertwined our fingers and brought my hands down with his. His taste, smell and touch slowly started to turn me on as the kiss became deeper and our tongues started to overlap each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took one of his hands from mine and moved it around waist. I inhaled quickly when I felt his hand go under my top and touch the warm skin of my back. He went to pull away but I stopped him by moving my hand to the back of his head and pulling him by his hair towards me with my now free hand. He chuckled into the kiss and then moved the hand he was holding to join my other hand and then moved both his hands to my wrists. His thumbs started caressing my wrists and then stopped and he slowly moved my sleeves up and then went back to my wrists and I could feel him slowly start to stop kissing me.  I tried moving my hands from around him but he held them tightly and then fully pulled away from me. He looked me in the eyes as he brought my hand down so he could look at my wrist. I tried once more to get my hand free but he held it tightly. I gulped as he looked at my wrist. &#34;You said you wouldn&#39;t do it anymore,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I said I&#39;d talk to you when I felt like doing it but you wouldn&#39;t talk to me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These were done today,&#34; he snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know and you weren&#39;t here, you had gone off in a mood somewhere,&#34; I said and looked down &#34;I tried ringing you but your phone was off,&#34; I state. I sigh and look down at my feet &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but when you&#39;re not here and I need you I don&#39;t know what else to do, because everything hurts,&#34; I cried. He sighs and hugs me tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry too,&#34; he said &#34;I&#39;ll be here from now on,&#34; and he kissed the top of my head. A few minutes passed and we pulled away from the hug. I looked at him and felt his arms go around my waist once more and hold me tightly. &#34;I don&#39;t really want to let go,&#34;he said with a small smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you have to as well I have an annoyed Brendan in my room that wants to watch a scary movie with me,&#34; he pulled back a little and frowned &#34;he doesn&#39;t want to go home,&#34; I state. He sighs and moves his hands from around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34;he said and opened the door to his room, &#34;I need to make a phone call anyway,&#34;he said and walked out. I sigh and walk out of his room and into mine to see Brendan had chosen a film and had found my alcohol stash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m staying here tonight ok,&#34; he states rather than ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok then,&#34; I frowned and shut my bedroom door and sat on my bed ready to watch the movie with him. He offered me the bottle of vodka in his hand. I shook my head and rested my head on his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what&#39;s the 4-1-1 with you and Logan?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, I have a slight crush on him and well that&#39;s it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah you were just making out with him for about ten minutes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was not,&#34; I huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure you weren&#39;t. I&#39;m being serious though, are you and him a couple?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No and we never will be, I think really my attraction to him is because he&#39;s showing me attention and nothing more,&#34; I paused &#34;there&#39;s nothing other than lust and attraction between us,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; he said and stroked my hair &#34;because I have a feeling he may hurt you and you don&#39;t deserve that,&#34;he says. I looked up at him to see him look away from the TV and look at me. &#34;I care about you a lot,&#34; I sigh &#34;and you know I do,&#34; and then he kissed my forehead and looked back at the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next morning I stood ready for Logan. Brendan was still in my bed fast asleep, I had to make sure he wasn&#39;t dead as I had made quite a bit of noise this morning and he still hadn&#39;t woken up. The reason I made so much noise was because Logan had told me to go get changed three times. Why is that? I hear you ask. Wellhe said he wants me wearing something that doesn&#39;t scream&#39; I&#39;m depressed as shit right now and said one bad thing to me and I may just go jump off the nearest cliff&#39; and those were his exact words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s better,&#34;he said smiling. I huffed and folded my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t like wearing skirts,&#34; I mutter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I don&#39;t see why not,&#34; he said, stretching as he grabbed his jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s the fittie in the mini?&#34; I heard Carl from behind me. I looked towards the game room to see him smirking at me. I rolled my eyes and tightened my folded arms. He frowned and stood in front of me. &#34;What&#39;s wrong honey bunny?&#34; he asks, pouting at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to wear the skirt,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not you look hot and if you were just a few months older I&#39;d do you,&#34; he paused and thought about it &#34;no wait I&#39;d do you anyway,&#34;he said to himself. &#34;But you look hot,&#34;he said, eyeing me up. I felt myself slowly wanting to crawl away into a hole as he looked at me. He stopped and looked away then sighs and looked back at me but in the eyes this time. &#34;Keep the skirt on,&#34; he said and then started to walk up the stairs. &#34;I won&#39;t be here when you get back,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Logan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a gang bang and then a band practice at a party and then another gang bang,&#34; he says. And then stopped in the middle of the stairs and turned to his side while looking at Logan. &#34;You&#39;re going to be missing all this action,&#34;he said and then stood straight and did an hourglass figure and pretended to bend what was in front of him and move his hips back and forth and then did a big cheesy grin &#34;Oh yeah,&#34; he mouthed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s nice to know,&#34; Logan said with a nod of his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But don&#39;t worry if I have enough juice left I&#39;ll rape you when I get home,&#34;he said with a cheesy grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok then I look forward to it,&#34; Logan commented and Carl walked off upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bye you two and don&#39;t get into trouble,&#34;he said and walked off to his room. I looked at Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he on medication?&#34; I ask . He shook his head &#34;He should be,&#34; I state and grabbed my coat and opened the large oak front door. I walked towards the car and Logan walked out after me following me to the car.</p>
