                <p>This gala has gone on forever, I didn&#39;t know it was going to be 6 courses. Six! However, when the first one came I can understand why. Tiny is the only word I can use to describe the portions. Logan is sat next to me with his fake date and all of our friends and his uncle and his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time Logan speaks to Erin he moves his hand onto my leg and I can&#39;t help but smile a little. Luckily for us, it&#39;s Yasmin sat on the other side of me. I&#39;ve been talking to her ignoring the business talk between Logan and a man that I can&#39;t remember the name of. Erin seems quite nice, she&#39;s spoken to me a few times and she rolls her eyes at the fact she caught between Logan and the businessman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to talk to Mel?&#34; Yasmin asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s avoiding me, I tried in between the first and second course but she just avoids me,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked her if I could have a talk and she said no, that she&#39;s busy,&#34; I pause &#34;but Logan told me to let her come to me,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess that might be better, I think Carl is trying to get me drunk,&#34; she says as she takes a sip of her wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say&#39;s the girl holding the glass to her own lips,&#34; I say with a small chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He keeps getting me the drinks,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know it&#39;s an open bar right?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; she asks shocked. I shake my head in response. I feel eyes on me, I look to my left to see Logan staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I ask smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, are you enjoying yourself?&#34; he asks. I nod causing him to smile slightly. &#34;I can tell Yasmin is enjoying the free bar,&#34; he states and I look at her too to see she&#39;s having a very animated discussion with Julie and Scott.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apparently that&#39;s Carls fault,&#34; I state. He looks towards Carl. I look to to see him down half of his beer. I frown and look at Logan. &#34;Is he ok?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t look like it, he hates things like this, it reminds him of his childhood,&#34; he states. &#34;I&#39;ll have to get him out of here soon otherwise he&#39;ll either start a fight or get so wasted he passes out,&#34; he adds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t imagine Carl fighting,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not a fighter that&#39;s the thing he just gets into his own head is all, his parents used to make him go to galas and balls like this all the time, with him being their only boy they would make him act a certain way. When he first came out to them, they told him it was just a faze and to never speak of it again, it was after that I met him,&#34; Logan informs. I frown in annoyance at the fact I know nothing about him. Not anything really personal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did Carl grow up?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Hamptons, New York,&#34; I frown in response &#34;I spent a lot of time their, mostly for the drugs,&#34; he clarifies. I raise my eyebrows and then look back at him. It&#39;s not that I forget he had a drug problem or that he is always in recovery, it&#39;s more the fact I just can&#39;t picture him doing them, even though I saw him overdose a few days ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I hear his uncle snap. Logan turns his attention from me &#34;you going to ignore your date all night?&#34; he asks while scowling at him. Logan and I both look at Erin to see she&#39;s not sat next to him anymore and is actually made her way over to a well known fashion designer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Duty calls,&#34; Logan mutters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make sure you&#39;re back for the 3rd course of the six we are to eat,&#34; I joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I&#39;ll miss out on food,&#34; he says frowning at me. I laugh and look at his uncle to see him glaring at me. I wonder what made this man so bitter. I really do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can honestly say I never thought such tiny food could fill me up so much. After the six courses, Logan had to do a speech and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen him look so confident. It turned out that tonight was for a teenager orphan charity that was set up only two years ago and Logan was the one to set it up. He&#39;s full of little secrets that I can&#39;t help but adore him for. He had just finished his speech and then got talking to a lot of people afterwards. Halfway through the speech I saw Carl get up and walk out of the room, Logan seemed to have noticed but carried on, Yasmin however did get up and go after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking to the right of me I see Mel sat two spaces away from me and she and I are the only one at the table. I wonder if now is the best time to talk to her. All I want is for our friendship to go back to normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mel-&#34; I start but then someone interrupts me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Wright,&#34; I look to see it&#39;s Logans uncle. &#34;A word?&#34; he asks and I feel like it more of a demand than a question. I look at Melanie to see her look at him then at me and instead of bailing me out like I know she normally would, she turns her attention to her phone. I sigh and nod at his uncle before standing up. I reach for my clutch but he stops me with his hand on my wrist. &#34;You won&#39;t need that,&#34; he states and pulls me out onto the dancefloor, not letting go of my wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moves his other hand to my waist and pulls me up against him. I gulp and loko up at him and try not to show the slight panic I have building inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to talk to you and this is the only way I can talk to you privately,&#34; he states not looking at me but over my head around the large ballroom. &#34;There are things you should know about Logan, you&#39;re not good for him, and that&#39;s not me been an arse. No one is good for him, not right anyway,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because he has baggage?&#34; I ask getting annoyed at this man who knows nothing about Logan yet thinks he can speak for him. &#34;Everyone has demons,&#34; I snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes true, he&#39;s no different than your demons, and unfortunately for him he doesn&#39;t realise it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Screw you,&#34; I snap, &#34;you are lucky we are in a public place right now,&#34; I growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s a violent person,&#34; he states looking me straight in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No he&#39;s not,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has many secrets, the drug abuse is only one of them,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well he&#39;s not like that anymore,&#34; I argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the look of your friends brother that&#39;s a lie, and he&#39;s like that because of you, there&#39;s a part of him that enjoys causing pain on people,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No there isn&#39;t,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he seem sorry about your friend?&#34; he asks. I say nothing as I realise Logan only said sorry because I told him to and he was only sorry at the fact I found out. &#34;He&#39;ll end up sleeping with Erin tonight and most likely another model here if he hasn&#39;t already,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Screw you,&#34; I grit out through my teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m only telling you this to protect you both, he&#39;s cheated on you once already, that you know of,&#34; he pauses &#34;I know what Logan is like, he&#39;s been like this before, become obsessed with a girl for a couple of months and then drops them once he gets bored or something else catches his eye,&#34; he pauses. &#34;It ends with the girl been heartbroken and him hating himself, that&#39;s what Erin was to him,&#34; he states. I go to reply when I hear someone clear their throat. I look to see David stood behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Wright,&#34; he states, holding his arm out to me. I pull myself away from Logan&#39;s uncle and take Davids offered arm, looping my own with his. Once we are far away enough to not be heard David talks. &#34;You looked like you needed saving,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I say as I try to hold the tears back. David leads me out of the ballroom down a long corridor and then into what looks like a library. He lets go of my arm and walks over to a small bar in the corner. I sit in one of the overstuffed chairs and try my best to calm myself down. A white cloth comes into view. I look up to see David holding his handkerchief out to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you ,&#34; I mutter again and dab at my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan told me to get you away from him, I fear I wasn&#39;t quick enough,&#34; he states and places a drink into my hand. I look at it to see a dark amber liquid swirl around some ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was that so he wouldn&#39;t tell me the truth about Logan?&#34; I ask and I start to feel annoyed at myself for feeding into what his uncle has told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did he say to you?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That I&#39;m just one of many girls he becomes obsessed with, that he&#39;s violent, that he enjoys hurting people,&#34; I answer. &#34;Is that true?&#34; I ask looking up at him. He&#39;s in a navy tuxedo that brings out his blue eyes that are now looking at me with sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you had asked me that a couple of years ago I&#39;d say partly true, I don&#39;t think he has ever been obsessed with anyone, it&#39;s usually the other way round. Violent, yes he was. I&#39;m not sure if he enjoyed it, I believe that to be the wrong term to use for it. But this isn&#39;t a conversation you should be having with me,&#34; he states and then stands up fully to then start walking to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be back,&#34; he states and walks out of the room.</p>
