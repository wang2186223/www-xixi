                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch Carl leave and slowly move my head into my hands. He was right I had never cheated on anyone and the thought of ever having another woman never came into my mind when I was with Stephanie not once and it hasn&#39;t with Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, please just said something, I&#39;m so sorry, I never meant for any of this to happen, I was just so angry at the fact you didn&#39;t trust me and I thought to myself last night how can we be together if you don&#39;t trust me,&#34; I explain &#34;I care about you so much Megan that I can&#39;t even understand why I&#39;ve done what I&#39;ve done,&#34; I sigh when I get no reply and then the bedroom door opens. I look to see Carl I sigh and look away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wants you to leave,&#34; he said and I frown. He holds out his phone and I stand while taking it. I look down at it to see a text message from Megan asking him to tell me to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said and hand him his phone, &#34;I&#39;ll wait outside,&#34; I said and walk out shutting the door. It was obvious now what her decision was with our relationship and I couldn&#39;t blame her. She most likely heard mine and Carl&#39;s argument which probably just pushed her decision more. I sigh and lean against the wall, this was probably the most scared I have ever been in my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan he&#39;s gone,&#34; I hear Carl say. I sigh in relief and stand while wiping my cheeks. I then slowly unlock the door and open it to see Carl stood waiting for me. &#34;Come here,&#34; he said holding his arms out. I walk over to him and let him wrap his arms around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what to do,&#34; I cry. He rubs my back and holds me tightly to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest Megan I don&#39;t think you should make a decision straight away, think about it for a few days,&#34; he said and I slowly pull back. &#34;I can tell he&#39;s sorry though,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he&#39;s never done that to anyone else, which asks the question why cheat on me?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; he said and sits on my bed. I sit next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s obvious someone up there who really doesn&#39;t like me,&#34; I said quietly. He laughs &#34;Maybe it&#39;s because I haven&#39;t slept with him yet and he was sexually frustrated,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be stupid,&#34; Carl says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I can&#39;t really think of any other reason,&#34; I said and move my head into my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well if this is any help when he gets drunk or mixes his drinks he gets very horny, I&#39;ve lost count on how many chances I&#39;ve had to get him into bed because of it,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah so basically if I don&#39;t want him to cheat on me again I have to be around him every time he gets drunk or mixes his drinks,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No well...I don&#39;t know it would depend if the person he&#39;s around instigates,&#34; he states &#34;for all you know the girl made a pass at him first,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl,&#34; I said and look at him &#34;so you&#39;re saying it&#39;s ok for him to cheat if the girl threw herself at him first?&#34; I ask. He sighs and shakes his head. &#34;Thank you, you&#39;re really not helping by the way,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know I&#39;m sorry,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to sleep because I really don&#39;t want to see him or even think about him,&#34; I said climbing into bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I&#39;ll tell him,&#34; Carl said and walks out of my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stand outside her door, Carl had told me she wanted some sleep. It was now nearly midnight and I just wanted to talk to her. She was most likely going to be awake because she can&#39;t always sleep which in a way works to my advantage right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening her door I come face to face with an empty bed. I sigh and look at Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not in here,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I heard her sneak out a while ago,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you didn&#39;t tell me because?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because it would have caused you to go get her and caused another argument with her, she obviously needs physical as well as mental space from you at the moment,&#34; he said folding his arms and leaning against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do you think she&#39; gone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To Melanie&#39;s,&#34; he said &#34;she has two people there who she can talk to about this and she&#39;ll most likely talk to both,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great,&#34; I said and sit on her bed. He looks at me and I move my head into my hands. This could mean that she may not ever talk to me about this because let&#39;s face it Brendan could just tell her to not ever go near me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s your own fault you know,&#34; he says. I sigh and look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So when did you start to have feelings for her?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To said I kissed her way before you did I&#39;d said before&#34; you did,&#34; he says. I look at him &#34;Plus she slept in my bed before yours and I&#39;ve seen her half naked,&#34; he said with a small smirk on his face which just makes me want to rip his face right off. &#34;Sorry,&#34; he said and looks down obviously seeing how angry that made me, &#34;look I didn&#39;t have the feelings you have for her until a few week ago, so I&#39;m going to keep my distance ok. I&#39;m not going to start chatting up your girl right in front of you or behind your back but mess up with her again and well don&#39;t think I&#39;m just going to sit and watch, if I see a chance I&#39;ll take it,&#34; he said to me and I expected nothing more for him to say. I wasn&#39;t going to stop being his friends because of his feelings. As they said you have no control over who you fall in love with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; is all I said to him, because I won&#39;t be letting him get a chance that is if she gives me another chance? &#34;Shall I call her?&#34; I ask him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No give her space, she&#39;ll most likely be back tomorrow,&#34; he said &#34;just get some sleep and think about everything in the morning,&#34; he says. I nod and lay down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a douche,&#34; Melanie said as she looks at me. Brendan sighs and looks at me too &#34;You&#39;re not going to forgive him are you?&#34; Melanie asks. I shrug at her question and look down &#34;You can&#39;t he didn&#39;t just kiss some random girl he slept with her too,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, but he is sorry I can tell and well it didn&#39;t mean anything,&#34; I said and she sighs in frustration at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t have to choose what she&#39;s going to do right this second Mel,&#34; Brendan said looking at her. I smile a little and move my hands through my hair I had told them both everything which led to Melanie&#39;s anger towards Logan. Brendan on the other hand seemed to be thinking it through and staying calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Melanie said and looks away &#34;we could go to a party,&#34; she said suddenly. I look at her &#34;Cade&#39;s having a party he was suppose to meet up with me but he rememberedhe said yes to having the dorm party or something sohe said I could come if I wanted,&#34; she explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cool,&#34; I said and look at her &#34;when is it?&#34; I ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It starts at seven,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I then look at Brendan to see him looking like he was in his own world. &#34;Bren, Bren,&#34; I said moving my hand in front of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I was thinking, I think,&#34; he said frowning. I smile and look away from him he was most likely in his own world. He has these moments where he just stares into space it&#39;s a lot o the time actually it&#39;s quite worrying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can Brendan come so I&#39;m not on my own when you go off with Cade?&#34; I ask. She nods and rolls her eyes as she stands and walks off into her bathroom. &#34;She&#39;s annoyed at me,&#34; I said to Brendan. She had become super defensive of me and I loved it but also hated it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes she is but it&#39;s only because she cares,&#34; he said and I sigh and watch him stand &#34;you want to come and play on the Xbox with me?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Might as well,&#34; I said and follow him out of Melanie&#39;s room to his room.</p>
