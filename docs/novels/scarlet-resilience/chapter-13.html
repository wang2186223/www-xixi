                <p>She leaned up and kissed me on the lips. I kissed her back while moving my hands to her neck and stepping forward. Once we got to the bed I picked her up and moved her back till she was laid down. I moved my hands down to her waist and then under her top. I then pulled back and rolled off her onto my back and then sat up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; she asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to go to sleep,&#34; I replied and ran my hands through my hair. I heard her sigh and then felt her arms go round my neck. &#34;Megan what are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why won&#39;t you sleep with me?&#34; she asks once she had rested her head on my shoulder. &#34;Don&#39;t you want me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re drunk and you won&#39;t remember any of this tomorrow and you&#39;re too young,&#34; I state and looked at her &#34;and I&#39;d lose everything if I did,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father was right,&#34; she said moving off me. I frowned and watched her stand and walk stagger towards her wardrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by that?&#34; I ask  a little offended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said no one would want me knowing what I am and what I&#39;ve done,&#34; she paused as she opened the wardrobe door and walked in &#34;plus no one wants someone who willingly had sex with their own father,&#34; she muttered but I heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood and walked over to her watching her root through her clothes which I didn&#39;t know why when none of her clothes fit her. That was the reason as to why she was always wearing jogging bottoms. &#34;You did not willingly he forced you and blackmailed you into it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really because I could have said no,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah and what would that have come to?&#34; I ask  &#34;him hurting your friend,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still said yes,&#34; she paused &#34;a number of times if I remember correctly,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That wasn&#39;t the first time?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head &#34;So you&#39;re right not to want me, I&#39;m a whore&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you&#39;re not, you haven&#39;t had sex,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So...what we were doing wasn&#39;t sex? Ok Logan, I must have played some scary shit arse painful game of twister with him&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No he raped you,&#34; I said harshly. She winced at the word &#34;sex is different sex you consent to it willingly without being forced or blackmailed, no matter how you look at it Megan it was all him all one sided and all rape,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop saying that word,&#34; she snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I don&#39;t want to hear it,&#34; she said as she started crying. &#34;Just shut up because you&#39;re wrong it was sex because I should know because I lost my virginity to him, to my own father so stop with all this it wasn&#39;t sex business because it was because I&#39;m never going to get it back,&#34; she yelled at me and she collapsed in a fit of tears. I sigh and kneeled down to her and went hug her &#34;no get off,&#34; she said pushing me away &#34;don&#39;t touch me,&#34; she cried and hugged her knees. &#34;You&#39;re always telling me to let you understand to help you understand but you&#39;ll never understand,&#34; she cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I mutter &#34;but I&#39;m trying to, I&#39;m trying my hardest to,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to be here anymore,&#34; she cried &#34;I just want to die, I can&#39;t stand the pain,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to hug her again and this time she let me. I sat crossing my legs holding her in my arms as she cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I heard Carl call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In here,&#34; I say. He then walked in and walked over to us. He sat at the other side of her and took her hand in his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard you both,&#34;he said quietly while looking at her. She turned away from him burying her head in my chest and took her hand out of his. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he muttered. She turned to look at him. He smiled a little and then looked down. He never knew what to do in situations like this, he found them difficult and awkward, and he was the least emotional person you would ever meet. He looked at me for help but I just gave him a shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I then heard the patter of my dog&#39;s feet running up the stairs. I took my hands from around her and lay back till my back was touching the floor and within seconds I felt him start licking my face. &#34;Ok stop,&#34; I said pushing him away and sitting up. He then moved to Megan sniffing her. She looked at him and slowly moved her hand to his head stroking him slowly. He sat and sniffed her face. She smiled and then stroked under his chin. I then stood and held my hand out for her, she took it and stood and then Carl stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to wash my face,&#34; she said walking out before us. I sigh and then felt Carl grab my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she ok?&#34; he asks. I frowned at him &#34;well obviously not but you know mentally because from what I heard she really doesn&#39;t seem it,&#34; I sigh and walked off &#34;I didn&#39;t mean it insultingly,&#34; he called back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Its fine,&#34; I said sitting on her bed waiting for her. Max sat at my feet and I started to stroke him. &#34;You know it&#39;s annoying how soft you are with how tough you look,&#34; I said to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Takes after his owner then,&#34; Carl muttered. I glared at him &#34;I&#39;m just saying you&#39;re like a girl,&#34;he states. I ignored his comment and looked back at my dog his crystal blue eyes looking back up at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Megan walked out of the bathroom and sat down next to me her bed and tapped her bed. Max moved away from me and jumped up next to her and she moved her hand onto his head as she leaned back till she was on her back. &#34;It&#39;s cute how much he&#39;s missed you,&#34; she said smiling and closing her eyes as she stroked him. I smiled and moved a blanket over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to get some sleep now?&#34; I ask . She nodded &#34;if you keep stroking him I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll stay next to you seen as he had to run here with Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; she said quietly. I sigh silently and stood up and walked out of her room with Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No she isn&#39;t,&#34; I said finally answering his question once I shut her bedroom door. I walked down the stairs and into the living room. &#34;She&#39;s seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist but they&#39;re the same thing,&#34; I mutter</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But would you be ok mentally after what she&#39;s gone through?&#34; I ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess not,&#34;he said sitting down and I sat on the other couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm, I think I may let Max stay with us for a while. It might help her a little as they said animals can help, do you mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s your dog,&#34;he states. I sigh and remained silent as I looked at my roll up that had died out. I sulked a little and started to roll myself another. &#34;Don&#39;t you think you&#39;ve smoked enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34;he states in that tone that said listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It helps ok,&#34; I state and started to break up the weed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened last night anyway because Eric told me you got banged up and the bruised and cut eyebrow sort of gives it away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I drove to a bar, got drunk and some guy decided to start so I beat the shit out of him,&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And?&#34; he asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I got let off because the guy is in hospital,&#34; I said as I licked the roll up paper and rolled the paper into the shape I wanted and sealed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fucking hell, don&#39;t tell me you did the old Logan shit on the guy?&#34; I nodded as I put the roll up to my lips and lit it. &#34;Ok just don&#39;t go back to your old shit because the last thing that girl needs is the rebel version of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan,&#34;he states &#34;I couldn&#39;t even handle that,&#34; he muttered to himself. I chuckled and took a big breath of the roll up. &#34;And you enjoy that shit too much,&#34;he states.</p>
