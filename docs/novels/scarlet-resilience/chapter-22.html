                <p>It&#39;s Sunday now and I&#39;m on my way to my grandfathers. He had sent a car to pick me up, seeing as Logan wasn&#39;t coming with me. He said he would come with me but what he had to do was important. A sigh escaped my lips as I saw my grandfather&#39;s mansion come into view, I didn&#39;t understand why he still lived in this mansion when it was only him and the whore that he called a girlfriend. She was about ten years older than me which meant she was young enough to be his granddaughter not that he saw that. She was a gold digger and like most perverted old men my grandfather&#39;s age he didn&#39;t see that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I said to the driver. He smiled from his rear view mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to thank me, it is my job after all,&#34;he said and got out of the car. I went to open my door when he opened it for me. I went to thank him again but he held a hand up to stop me &#34;no need to thank me again it&#39;s my job,&#34; I sighed a little and folded my arms as I felt the coldness of the winter breeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front door opened and stood there was my grandfather. He stood at 6ft and had silver grey hair with the same green eyes as me. I watched him let out a breath and then smile at me. I sighed and walked up the drive to the door. He went to give me a hug but I moved away from him.  I looked him up and down to see he wasn&#39;t in his usual attire, he was wearing jobbing bottoms and a plain black t-shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s good you came,&#34;he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t really have a choice on the matter do I?&#34; I mutter. He sighed and moved out of the doorway to let me in. I slowly walked in and looked around the huge hallway, like always it was very well lit and immaculately</p>
                
                
                
                <p>clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How has your week been?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I said and followed him to the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natasha isn&#39;t in at the moment, she&#39;s shopping. She should be back in time for dinner,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you don&#39;t like her but when she is here I&#39;d like it if you&#39;d get along with her as she wants you to like her,&#34;he stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you even with her anyway?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know how you see her and I think we shouldn&#39;t get into this and don&#39;t worry Princess she&#39;s not in my will,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t care less to be honest I&#39;d rather not be in your will, I hope you give it all to her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well we can&#39;t all get we want,&#34;he stated and handed me the TV remote as I sat on the sofa. &#34;How are the sessions going?&#34; he asks while sitting down on the opposite side of the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I said yawning and kicking my converse off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you been sleeping?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I said and started to get comfy. I then flicked on the TV and started to channel surf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So where is Logan?&#34; he asks &#34;he phoned to tell me he wasn&#39;t going to be here today, I&#39;m just wondering why,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, allhe said to me was that he had something important to do,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you taking your medication?&#34; he asks. I looked at him &#34;I&#39;m just curious,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I&#39;m taking it, the only thing I&#39;m not taking is the sleeping pills,&#34; I said &#34;and I don&#39;t see the point in me taking any of the medication when the anti-depressants aren&#39;t working and the pain killers just make me a little drowsy,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you might be off the painkillers soon after you&#39;ve had another X-ray at the hospital,&#34;he stated. &#34;As I&#39;m sure the damage to your ribs and your foot should be fully healed,&#34; he paused &#34;at least you didn&#39;t have to come back home with the pot on, you were in hospital for eight week altogether and the pot was only on for six,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm and most of those weeks I was in a coma,&#34; I said as I stopped flipping once I got to Charmed on the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, how&#39;s the new phone?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s that boyfriend of yours?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have a boyfriend,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do, what&#39;s his name Kyle or something,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tyler and we broke up ages ago,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I&#39;m sorry, why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Benjamin told me to break up with him or he&#39;d kill him so I did,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you not getting back together though?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I don&#39;t really want to and we wouldn&#39;t have much of a relationship anyway,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34; he asks, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really think I want to have a boyfriend after what&#39;s happened?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure he&#39;d understand,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah and have him cheat on me again because I won&#39;t let him touch me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s cheated on you?&#34; he asked, shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A year ago, he thinks I don&#39;t know but I do and well I don&#39;t really care to be honest,&#34; he frowned at me and I looked at him &#34;we were at a party and there&#39;s a girl in our year, she has tried to split us up a couple of times and well he got pretty drunk, he didn&#39;t sleep with her. He just made out with her so I wasn&#39;t too fussed. If it had been anything more than a kiss then I would have been bothered,&#34; I explained &#34;he hardly remembers it though as his friend told me he doesn&#39;t remember half of that night never mind that kiss,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But still cheating is cheating,&#34; he stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True, but I watched him and her kiss and well he told her to piss off and well he got a bit too angry with her after it and then the next day I watched his friend tell him what happened and well he wasn&#39;t exactly pleased with himself,&#34; I paused and looked at him again &#34;I didn&#39;t really care to be honest because I&#39;ve done the same thing,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie&#39;s brother. We had an argument one day and well yeah you can see where this is going,&#34; I explained and looked towards the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh well you&#39;re too young for boys,&#34;he stated. I smirked a little and looked at him, he smiled back at me &#34;you are, you want to wait till you&#39;re at least 30 for boyfriends,&#34; I shook my head at him and continued to watch Charmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl looked at me and tilted his head a little &#34;Black?&#34; he asks &#34;didn&#39;t she make you promise to wear something bright at the funeral?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes and I am,&#34; I said pulling up my black sleeve to show a bright orange, pink, green and yellow bracelets. He sighed and rolled his eyes at me &#34;she only made me promise her that because she knows how much I&#39;m not a fan of bright colours,&#34; I huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just go wear a bright coloured tie or something,&#34; Carl suggested, I shook my head and walked away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to get so high today,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well that&#39;s not going to be any different from most of this week,&#34;he stated. I looked at him &#34;I&#39;m serious, you&#39;ve been high like every day,&#34;he said and walked past me &#34;which I don&#39;t think is a good thing because you have a responsibility now, you know that responsibility called Megan,&#34;he said turning and walking backwards towards the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I know,&#34; I muttered and followed him out as I put on my blazer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah and have you at least thought about how it could affect her?&#34; he asks &#34;as well you and me both know she&#39;s not mentally stable, I&#39;m just waiting for her to have an episode,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t talk like that and no I haven&#39;t thought of it like that but what do you expect from me? Would you rather I was depressed around her and tell her &#39;yea life sucks lets go commit suicide&#39;?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I just think you should be more careful. It&#39;s ok having like half a joint but you&#39;re having about four a night,&#34;he said and walked towards the limousine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and run a hand through my hair while looking at him. He was right in a way but I was coping and I was going back to therapy so it wasn&#39;t like I was being completely irresponsible.</p>
