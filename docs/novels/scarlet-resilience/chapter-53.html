                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about ten minutes all the girls are out and it&#39;s just me and her. I stand and take my P.E kit out of my bag. Our P.E kit is skimpy, red shorts and a white t-shirt I am not saying like board shorts I mean skimpy shorts as in hot pants. I sigh once I&#39;m changed into them and look at Melanie. She fills hers unlike me. My legs were pretty much like matchsticks and I hated this because I used to fill mine like her. Melanie had the perfect figure. I wondered why she never had a boyfriend. In fact a lot of people did, but she was picky as hell and I admired her for it to be honest. She hated the guys in this school, she had only ever liked one guy and he graduated two years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looks at me and smiles and then takes my wrists in her hands &#34;Are you still cutting?&#34; she asks. I shake my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m trying my best to stop,&#34; I said and she nodded showing she understood and then pulled me into a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can always call me you know,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I said and pulled away &#34;we should go,&#34; I said and pulled on my t-shirt to cover me a little as I walked into the gym and as I did I noticed Logan stood by the P.E teacher. I walk up to the rest of the class and link my arm with Melanie&#39;s and stand while listening to the P.E teacher explain what we were doing today.  And we were doing gymnastics today, the joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour has passed and I&#39;m sitting on one of the benches watching as they learn how to do back flips. I had taken Gymnastics when I was little because my mother insisted I try every club going. I did Gymnastics for years, boxing, tennis, dance, street dance, ballet, piano lessons, singing, scouts, swimming, everything. It was just ridiculous. I did however get a choice after three weeks of each if I wanted to stay in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know you were so flexible,&#34; I hear an English accent say. I look at Logan and smile a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I took lessons and went to a few competitions also,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well that was impressive,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only did a few back flips and half pikes and handstands,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can do the splits, that&#39;s impressive to me,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here anyway?&#34; I ask &#34;haven&#39;t you got people to teach?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, and I&#39;m here because I wanted to see if you would actually come to class,&#34; he said and sits next to me. &#34;You have a poor attendance in this class,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah well getting naked in front of half the girls in my year wasn&#39;t exactly on my top priorities last year,&#34; I state &#34;and it isn&#39;t this year,&#34; I pause and lean back &#34;but what does it matter they all saw my back when I had</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to do a flipping handstand,&#34; I growl and fold my arms &#34;now all they need to do now is stick freak on my forehead,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And paint you the school colours then they&#39;ve got a mascot,&#34; he states. I look at him and he looks completely serious. I laugh a little and he smiles &#34;I&#39;m kidding,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is Courtney giving me evils?&#34; I ask. He looks at where I&#39;m looking &#34;I hate her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because when I and Tyler went out she was the one he cheated on me with and she took great enjoyment in rubbing that in my face,&#34; I state. &#34;Plus she hates me,&#34; I add.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s one of those girls that would be only good for sex just because she&#39;d annoy the shit out of you afterwards,&#34; he states. I look at him, my jaw dropping &#34;what? Too far?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you even allowed to say that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are lots of things I&#39;m not allowed to do that I do Megan,&#34; he said, smirking at me. I smile a little and he moves his hand through his hair and looks at the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need a shave,&#34; I state. He looks at me &#34;I don&#39;t want beard burn off you like earlier,&#34; I said quietly and I stood up to brush myself off. I scratch my back and then I feel him slap my hand back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have I told you about scratching,&#34; Logan snaps at me. I look at him then down as he tells me off. He tells me all the time but the scabs were just so itchy it was unbelievable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; I said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ll scar if you pick and scratch you know,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re going to scar anyway,&#34; I state and he sighs. &#34;If you&#39;re done embarrassing me can I go?&#34; I ask. He frowns and looks around to see everyone staring at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever,&#34; I said and walked out of the gym. I get changed as soon as I get in the changing room and run my hand through my hair and take my phone from my bag. I look through my contacts and get to Brendan&#39;s name and as I am about to press call someone sits next to me. I look to see Logan. I sigh and close my phone.  He moves his arm around me and pulls me into a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he said and moved my hair from my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to go home,&#34; I said and start to cry</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I&#39;ll take you home,&#34; he said and stood. I stand too and wipe my eyes; he strokes my cheek a little and steps forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyone could walk in,&#34; I said quietly. He smiles a little and kisses my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be back in a minute,&#34; he said and walked out of the changing room. I collect my stuff together, walk out of the changing room and wait for him. After a few minutes he returns and walks with me to the heads office. I look at him and then look around to see there was no one about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I said and he looked at me &#34;can I change schools?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he said without even putting any thought into it. &#34;The reason is because wherever you go people are going to know your face at least for a good year and changing schools isn&#39;t going to change anything,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But then we can be together,&#34; I said and he stopped walking and looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that what you&#39;re worried about? That we&#39;ll get caught?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A little and if we do then what will happen?&#34; I ask &#34;because I&#39;m scared you&#39;ll get taken away from me and then I won&#39;t know what to do,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dilly dally, shilly shally,&#34; he says, I frown at him completely confused &#34;dilly dally shilly shally,&#34; he said once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess you&#39;ve never watched Final Fantasy, Carl used to said that a lot to me whenever I worried about minor things,&#34; he explains and then looks at me &#34;and that&#39;s what you are worrying about, something very minor, we will talk about it if that time comes,&#34; he said &#34;now come on or is it you didn&#39;t want to go home you just wanted to spend time with me?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A bit of both,&#34; I said and looked around once more to see no one in view. I smile and walk towards a supply closet, open it and grab him by his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh ok haven&#39;t done this in a while,&#34; he said &#34;be gentle with me I&#39;m delicate,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan shut up,&#34; I said and hugged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh and I thought we were going to get down and dirty,&#34; he paused. &#34;This is much better,&#34; He leans against the door and gets down to my level so I&#39;m in-between his legs. &#34;I&#39;m too big for this closet,&#34; he said and moved his hands down my back to my bum. I look at him and move my arms around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or maybe this closet is too small,&#34; I said and moved my fingers through his hair. He presses his lips together &#34;I&#39;m not kissing you,&#34; I state. He frowns &#34;told you beard burn is a no,&#34; I say. He raises an eyebrow and pulls me into a kiss.  I kiss him back and feel prickling on my lips. I pull back. &#34;See,&#34; I said and rubbed my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s because you&#39;re not used to it dating all these &#39;boys&#39; I&#39;m a man you see,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; I ask. His jaw drops and I smile a little &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I pout. He smiles and taps my nose with his finger. My nose scrunches and I lay my head on his shoulder. &#34;If I go home you&#39;ve got to come back here don&#39;t you?&#34; I ask. He nods and holds me close to him. &#34;That sucks,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes it does,&#34; he said moving his hand on my head moving his fingers through my hair &#34;I will have a shave though when I get home, promise,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, I&#39;ve nearly got third degree burns,&#34; I said rubbing my lips</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not that bad,&#34; he said and stood up straight towering over me. &#34;Now come on or we are going to get caught,&#34; He turns and slowly opens the door and looks around &#34;It&#39;s clear come on,&#34; he said and drags me out of it by my hand, he then lets go.</p>
