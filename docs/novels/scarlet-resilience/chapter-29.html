                <p>Brendan watched from Megan&#39;s window as she climbed into Logan&#39;s black Porsche and then watched them drive off. He sighs and looked at his phone and searched through his contacts to find Melanie&#39;s number. He put the phone to his ear and waited for her to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; Melanie snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing it&#39;s just I&#39;ve had no sleep because I&#39;ve had to listen to mom and dad argue over you,&#34; she paused &#34;it&#39;d really help if you were here sometimes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34;he said and sat on Megan&#39;s bed and reaching for his cigarettes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s mom working today?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think she&#39;s working at the main site because one of her patients needs to be supervised because of what happened last time,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The one that told her about his dream and then tried to act out his dream,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah and well as he&#39;s being sectioned he&#39;s demanding it&#39;s only her he sees,&#34; Melanie stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; Brendan sighs &#34;Are you at school?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, I&#39;ll be home tonight by the way. Cya soon,&#34;he said and put the phone down and quickly got dressed. Once dressed, he made his way down the giant staircase and out of the big oak front door to his motorbike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After around ten minutes he was home. He walked into his home and looked around &#34;Mom,&#34; he shouted and he got no answer &#34;Dad?&#34; and he got no answer again. He sighs in relief and walked towards his mothers work room. He tried the door but it was locked. He sighs and walked into the kitchen got a knife and then walked up the stairs to Melanie&#39;s room and took a few hair pins from her dresser. He then made his way back downstairs to his mother work room and started to pick the lock. After a few minutes the door unlocked and he walked in shutting the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendan made his way to a filing cabinet labelled with letters. The first one read A to F the second G to L the third M to Q the forth marked R to U and the fifth one V to Z. He frowned trying to remember something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; he said to himself &#34;What was Melanie saying?&#34; he asked himself &#34;Mr P, P,&#34; he sighs and growled in frustration and went to the third drawer. &#34;Does she have to lock everything,&#34; he growled and started to pick the drawer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes passed and he had finally unlocked it, &#34;That was a tricky one,&#34;he said and opened up the drawer. He scoured through file after file going past names and then he saw L.Peters. He looked down a few names to see there were no more L.Peters. He took the file out and his eyes widened. &#34;Fuck me you must be one messed up fucker,&#34;he said referring to how thick the file was. He then sat down in the chair his mother would sit in and opened up the file. He raised his eyebrows as he turned each divider in the file all saying &#39;Private and Confidential&#39; in bold red letters. He sighs and sat back looking at the file but not fully looking at what it was saying. He knew what he was doing was breaking the law but he also knew there was something about him that he was hiding from Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flicking through the pages skim reading most of them and not reading others he stopped once he saw it said Age 18. He skimmed read it at first until it started to get more interesting. &#39;Morbid thoughts&#39; it read in his mother&#39;s handwriting and underlined in red &#39;excessive need to rebel and spend money&#39; &#39;drug use&#39; &#39;manic depression since wife was put on life support&#39; &#39;violent outburst&#39; &#39;making decisions that wouldn&#39;t normally make e.g. having someone beaten&#39; Brendan&#39;s eyes widened as those words stood out. He sighs and starts to read from the beginning. He started from when Logan&#39;s wife died and read all the way through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendan was shocked to discover that Logan had hired several men to beat several people and had once hired someone to kill someone but later called off the hit. He had also learnt that Logan had once tried to take his own life and was taking heroin to control himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The document had also told Brendan that Logan had a sex addiction, drug addiction and a mental dependence on marijuana and by the age of 19 he had moved to England and was sectioned. It was there he took up a teaching course and made himself a qualified teacher at the age of 21. Logan had been released from rehab and the hospital last year in May.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front door slamming shut made Brendan jump. He quickly put the file back together in the right order as he had kept it in order as he went along.  He stood and put the file back in the drawer and then walked over to the door and opened it slowly and the first thing he saw was his sister. His eyes widened a little and he looked at the clock to see it was 1pm, he looked back to see her drag a boy into the house and then kiss him. Brendan sighs in relief and walks over to the filing cabinet to lock it back up. He then walked out of his mothers work room and shut the door. The sound of it clicking indicating it had locked itself.  He leant against it while folding his arms watching them. He watched as his sister kissed the boy and then started to lead him upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow,&#34;he said loudly so she heard him. She jumped back from the boy and looked down at him. He walked over to them. &#34;I never thought you were one of them girls,&#34;he said and then looked at the boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave before I make you a woman,&#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never got her drunk,&#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave,&#34; Brendan warned. The boy nodded and left leaving a drunken Melanie on the stairs. Brendan sighs and looks at his sister. &#34;What are you doing?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; she said and turned stumbling as she tried to walk up the stairs. He sighs and caught her before she fell and then picked her up bridal style. He carried her to her room and then laid her on her bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; he asks. She remained silent &#34;What were you doing with that guy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s a friend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie, he looked older than me,&#34; he states. She huffed and turned away from him &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you thought having your first with some guy that doesn&#39;t even care about you would make you feel better?&#34; he asks. &#34;You are still a virgin right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank god,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sound like dad,&#34; she said, rolling her eyes and sitting up to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you&#39;re my sister, and I know you&#39;re going to one day I&#39;m not bothered to be honest I was just hoping that this was the first time you&#39;ve done that,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is,&#34; she said and laid her head on her head board and looked down. She sighs and looked at him &#34;Megan hardly talks to me,&#34; she states &#34;and I feel like a very shitty friend because she couldn&#39;t even tell me that her dad was raping her and I don&#39;t blame her because I didn&#39;t even believe her, even the night before she went into hospital I never truly believed her.&#34; She paused &#34;And that makes me a shit friend because I should have,&#34; she paused &#34;when I think about it most of the things that have happened to her could have being avoided if I had ignored her and just told someone what she had told me,&#34; she sighs and then started to fiddle with her lip ring &#34;and well I just feel like I can&#39;t control anything anymore, I&#39;m failing at school and well I sort of want a boyfriend,&#34; she said looking down a bit embarrassed. &#34;I mean no guy ever looks at me, it&#39;s always the others, it&#39;s like I have this big sign above my head saying don&#39;t come near she&#39;s not girlfriend material,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry you don&#39;t,&#34; he paused and moved his hand above her head and looked up &#34;Nope you don&#39;t,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She giggled &#34;But you got to admit when I&#39;m at school it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s Brendan&#39;s sister and then they go no it isn&#39;t she&#39;s nothing like him,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First of all you&#39;re not going to be like me as you&#39;re a girl,&#34;he states &#34;and second you have your own personality and you do have guys that look at you trust me,&#34; her stated. She looked at him &#34;A few of my friends fancy you which is annoying because at one point we were in the Mall and I didn&#39;t notice you and one of them told me to look at this fittie and when I looked I saw it was you I was like that&#39;s my sister arsehole,&#34;he said while scratching his head &#34;and do you want to know what he said to me after that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well she&#39;s got a nice pair, give me her number,&#34; he paused. &#34;Unfortunately for him he knows if he makes a comment like that about you again he will not live next time I beat him,&#34; Brendan stated. &#34;Just because a guy isn&#39;t hooking up with you every minute of the day doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t finding you attractive. It&#39;s all to do with what a girl gives off and well a guy can look at you and know you&#39;re not easy that is why, most want an easy lay.&#34;he states &#34;And well unlike most girls you have standards or at least I hope because the guy you were just necking didn&#39;t seem to be high standard,&#34; Melanie sighs &#34;get some sleep and sleep off the alcohol before mom and dad get home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t tell them will you?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, as long as you don&#39;t do it again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t,&#34; she paused. &#34;I think I&#39;m going to throw up,&#34; she said, getting up and running into the bathroom. Brendan pulled a disgusted look when he heard her being sick and then walked out of her bedroom to his own.</p>
