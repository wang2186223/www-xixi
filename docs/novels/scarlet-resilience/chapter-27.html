                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan&#39;s arms went around me and he hugged me back. I remained silent. All I had been wanting since Sunday night was this hug, the hug that made me feel safe and secure. It was only him that could give this hug to me, no one else. He always made me feel completely safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caressed down my back and I moved my hands down his back and then only just realising that he was wet. I pulled back and then quickly folded my arms across my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he asks while moving the hair that was now stuck to the side of my face because of him. I looked him in the eyes and then looked away and hugged him again. &#34;Are you going to tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I just need a hug first,&#34; I say. He chuckles and wraps his arms around me. I smile to myself ever so slightly and then pull away. I should probably let you get dressed first,&#34; I say slowly, stepping away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah that would be a good idea,&#34;he said and moved a hand to his towel. I bit my bottom lip and looked him up and down and then frowned at myself and walked out of his room. I had just checked him out right in front of him too. I squeezed my eyes shut and an image of him standing in a towel came to my mind. I quickly opened my eyes and walked into my room to see Brendan still lying on my bed reading the back of a DVD.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is he?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I said smiling to myself, &#34;very fine,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a crush on him,&#34; he said still while reading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I said and walked over to my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure you don&#39;t,&#34; he states and then looks at me. &#34;That was quick anyway,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He needs to get dressed,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, why is your hair wet,&#34; he said, touching my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm no reason,&#34; I said and looked down &#34;so have you picked a movie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope,&#34; he said and looked at another one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and walk back out of my room to Logan&#39;s room. I knocked on his door and then slowly opened it to see him sitting on his bed reading through a piece of paper. He put the paper on his bedside table and then looked at me. I gave him a small smile as I registered what he was wearing and it was just a pair of jeans and it seemed to be dark blue Calvin Klein boxers. I frowned once more and looked down at the floor, why did I just notice what boxers he was wearing? I ask  myself and then shut his bedroom door and sat down in front of him on his bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood and walked over to the mirror picking up something and then sitting back down in front of me. &#34;Do you mind if I put these in?&#34; he asks holding two lip rings. I shook my head and watched him as he put them in. &#34;You can talk to me while I do it,&#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm ok,&#34; I breathed and then looked away from him and took a deep breath and then looked back at him &#34;on Sunday my grandfather told me something,&#34; I state. He looked at me once he had finished putting one lip ring in. &#34;He said my father was going to be getting out this year,&#34; he stopped what he was doing and his face became emotionless. Then he frowned and looked at me &#34;Something about he wouldn&#39;t last in prison and he may only get a light sentence because he is mentally ill and urm he had been in a psychiatric hospital before and it didn&#39;t help, so they may resort to do what they did last time,&#34; I said and paused &#34;and last time he lived at home with a carer that supplied him with his medication and then he went to a psychiatrist and it got sorted and he became better,&#34; I looked down at my lap as I said all this. &#34;And as he wasn&#39;t in his right mind when everything that happened to me he may not be found guilty on all of the charges,&#34; I said &#34;which means he may only get six months maybe a year but either way he&#39;s going to be out soon,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan stood and paced up and down and then out of nowhere he threw his lip ring at the mirror causing it to crack and stormed off into the bathroom slamming the door behind him causing me to jump. I stood and walked towards the mirror to see his lip ring stuck into the mirror. My eyebrows rose and I took the lip ring from the mirror and walked to the bathroom door. I went to knock when the door opened and he stood there facing me causing me to gulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he suddenly said. I frowned &#34;I told you I&#39;d always be there for you no matter what and that whenever you called me I would answer and that night I didn&#39;t answer you even though you phoned me twice. I broke that promise and I&#39;m sorry,&#34;he said and stepped forward. &#34;I&#39;ll never break that promise again and that&#39;s a promise,&#34;he said and pulled me into a hug. &#34;Do you forgive me?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said and moved my arms around him &#34;it wasn&#39;t like I had no one to talk to about it you know,&#34; I state. He sighs and held me tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know and it sucks to know that you had someone that isn&#39;t me to comfort you,&#34;he said &#34;I want to be the only one you tell things to,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and pulled away from him while looking down at my feet and then looked up at him. He slowly started to lean forward. I gulped and turned my head a little to look away from him so he didn&#39;t kiss me &#34;I should probably go,&#34; I said as I slowly moved to look at him, his lips not that far from mine. He agreed quietly but still didn&#39;t pull away and neither did I. I expected myself to be scared now like I am whenever anyone else gets this close to me. The only time I didn&#39;t was when I was drunk but not right now. Right now I was completely sober and I wanted him to kiss me, just like I have before. It was strange but he was the only person I wasn&#39;t scared of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our lips lingered towards each other. I bit my bottom lip and then looked down. We were touching, his hands were at my hips, my hands were on his bare chest and now his head was leaned on mine. &#34;This shouldn&#39;t be happening,&#34; I said quietly. &#34;I&#39;m not supposed to fall for you, you&#39;re my teacher and we have to remember that,&#34; I said and he sighs and kisses the top of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, but I&#39;ve tried to ignore my feelings for you but like they said you can&#39;t ignore the strong feelings you have for someone,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not listening, the fact you&#39;re my teacher is just an excuse. I wouldn&#39;t care if you were my head teacher and if I liked you I&#39;d still go after you,&#34; I say. He raised his eyebrows, &#34;It&#39;s just I can&#39;t feel like this because I know it will end bad and someone will get hurt,&#34; I explained &#34;and well I know that I&#39;m not emotionally stable for any of this,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The fact that you know you&#39;re emotionally unstable means you are ready,&#34; he paused &#34;but I know what you mean, but it is obvious we are both attracted to each other,&#34;he says. &#34;Because right now I want to kiss you,&#34; I looked up at him, he smirked &#34;and if you don&#39;t let me I&#39;m just going to be kicking myself all night,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why should I let you kiss me?&#34; I ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you want me to,&#34; he said still with that charming devilish smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, why should I let someone I know nothing about kiss me?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t get cold sores,&#34; he said with a smile. I smiled a little trying to stop myself from smiling fully, he chuckled &#34;it&#39;s true I&#39;ve never had one and well, I think that&#39;s the most important thing,&#34; he paused &#34;apart from whether or not I&#39;m a good kisser but you know that already,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan, I&#39;m serious, I know nothing about you, you don&#39;t tell me anything about you and you expect me to tell you everything about me,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighs &#34;Tomorrow I will tell you everything,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just saying that so I&#39;ll let you kiss me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I&#39;m not, we&#39;re going out as we do need to talk as I have some questions for you,&#34;he states. &#34;I probably won&#39;t tell you everything but I&#39;ll tell you as much as I&#39;m willing to tell you,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like how I was a couple of years ago, like how I was practically just a stoner and because I had money I used it for things that would lock me up for life,&#34;he says. My eyebrows knitted together &#34;I just hope you won&#39;t hate me once hearing some of the things,&#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that why you haven&#39;t told me anything?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34;he said and then looked me in the eyes &#34;having you hate me would be,&#34; he paused as he moved a bit of my hair &#34;it would be hell for me,&#34; he and then kissed me.</p>
