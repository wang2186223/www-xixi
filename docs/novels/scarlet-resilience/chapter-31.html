                <p>I sat there looking at Logan as we sat on the river bank decking to see him looking straight up at the sky. I shivered and folded my arms across my chest. I was freezing and it was his entire fault for making me wear a skirt. My legs were now blue and were almost matching my leg warmers. I cursed under my breath as I had left my coffee by the bench we are sitting at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Care to tell me about your relationship with Brendan?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re friends,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He sighs &#34;Do you really expect me to believe that when you go out with him for a full 48 hours and come back with love bites and then he sleeps the night the next day?&#34; he asks. I sigh and look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was drunk and so was he,&#34; I say. His head shot up and straight away I knew what he was thinking &#34;No we did not do it,&#34; I state, &#34;We made out a couple of times I think well he said we did so I guess we did,&#34; she paused &#34;he&#39;d never sleep with me not yet anyway, he said &#39;eighteen and over always,&#39; He doesn&#39;t want some 16 year old coming up to him thinking he&#39;s in love with them when he really isn&#39;t&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if he is in love with someone under the age of eighteen?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;d make an exception obviously but only if the girl was ready, he&#39;s actually a really decent person which is what people don&#39;t realise when looking at him.&#34; I paused &#34;In a way he&#39;s like you,&#34; he raised his eyebrows at me &#34;he&#39;s just like you but a younger version if he cares about someone he does anything he can to make sure they&#39;re safe and well if anyone hurts the people he cares about or loves he would kill them.&#34; I smirked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can look at me like that all you want but he is exactly like you when it comes to affection and caring for someone,&#34; I stated and looked away from him. He sighs which indicated he had finally given up being stubborn and agreed with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence laced over us. I could feel him tensing up at every second that passed. The wind blew and max who was enjoying himself in the river, tried to get the birds and get the stick Logan had thrown for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure that dog is really a dog, isn&#39;t it cat&#39;s who normally go after birds?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do sometimes wonder,&#34; Logan said and lent back and looked at me. I smiled and watched Max carry a stick in his mouth while he doggy paddled towards us. Logan took the stick and threw it far down the river.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was mean, he&#39;ll never find it,&#34; I state. He chuckled and I watched Max swim as fast as he could towards where Logan had thrown the stick. I heard Logan move and then felt something drop on my shoulders. I looked at Logan to see he had taken his jacket off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take your jacket off and put mine on and put yours on your legs,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t I just put yours on my legs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because my jacket would look better on you,&#34;he states. I sigh and do what he says. He smiled &#34;See I was right yet again, my jacket looks better on you,&#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes and folded my arms across my chest. &#34;Urm...&#34; I started getting nervous on the subject I was going to bring up. He looked at me &#34;Last night we kissed,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,&#34;he said &#34;we&#39;ve kissed quite a few times,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm...this time I was sober and so was you...and you may have forgotten because you haven&#39;t been at work for a while but you&#39;re my teacher and well there are consequences to kissing a student,&#34; I state. He sighs and I finally looked at him to see him smiling a little. &#34;Is it only me that sees those consequences because I don&#39;t want you to get into trouble, and I know last night I didn&#39;t say that I said the complete opposite but you could lose a lot from what we have done,&#34; I explained and he was still smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you see this is where I show how much smarter I am to you,&#34;he said smiling &#34;the only way for me to get into trouble is if you told people that would tell the school. Have you told people?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve told Melanie and Brendan and well Julie&#39;s like some mind reader so she knows we&#39;ve kissed,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now do you really think those people would tell anyone,&#34; he paused. &#34;I don&#39;t because they all want you to be happy and if they thought I was going to make you unhappy they would tell someone. Or if they thought I had forced myself onto you which I would never in a million years. I&#39;m guessing they don&#39;t because I would probably have been arrested by now,&#34; he explained. I sigh and look away from him shaking my head a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if I don&#39;t want a relationship with you? Then what?&#34; I asked  and looked at him to see the smile fade into a barely there frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t be able to do anything about it, it&#39;s up to you on whether you want to be with me or not,&#34;he states and I could tell as he said it, it hurt him. It was the best though to hurt him now rather than string him along and hurt him later on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about we just do what we said we&#39;d do when we first kissed?&#34; I suggested he looked at me confused, &#34;wait till I am out of high school and see if we still have feelings for each other,&#34; I say. He sighs and nods. I smiled and looked at him &#34;Good because it isn&#39;t like you have long to wait really,&#34; I said and stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m an impatient man,&#34; he said, getting up and looking up at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could have fooled me, I think you are very patient,&#34; I said and as I took off his jacket and put on my own he stepped to the side of me. I looked up at him to see him looking straight ahead and then he took his jacket off me and put it on. He turned and looked at the river to see Max still swimming around. He moved his right hand to his lips forming a circle with his thumb and index finger and whistled. Max turned and Logan whistled again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Max,&#34; he called. The dog swam towards the river bank and after a couple of tries it jumped out and ran towards us. My eyes widened and I quickly got behind Logan. Max shook his whole body, wetting Logan. I giggled as he moved away from the massive dog. Max looked at him and then jumped up onto him. &#34;Get off,&#34; he growled and pushed the dog down. &#34;Naughty,&#34;he said glaring at him. Max whimpered and I chuckled and walked out from behind Logan looking clean and dry and stood at the side of the dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aww,&#34; I said kneeling down and stroking his face, &#34;it his own fault isn&#39;t it,&#34; I said to Max and then turned to Logan &#34;how can you shout at this cute lickle face?&#34; I ask  pulling a baby face. He rolled his eyes and walked off taking his jacket off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stupid dog,&#34;he said out loud. I giggled and stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on max,&#34; I said as I walked slowly behind Logan. &#34;Daddy&#39;s upset because you ruined his favourite jacket and because you got his hair wet,&#34; I said, making sure Logan heard. He looked at me and I saw the small smirk on his face just before he looked back in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart pounded as Logan put the car into park in my grandfathers drive. Logan looked at me and I slowly looked out my window and folded my arms. I felt his hand on my leg and I moved it away from him out of his reach. He sighs and I could still feel him looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t we just go back to the house please?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to get the facts, the full facts on what would happen when he does get out and if he&#39;s got rules to follow,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I cannot believe you, for the past few months you&#39;ve been telling me to forget about him because he&#39;s not in my life anymore and now he&#39;s back in my life you want me to give him the acknowledgement?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not saying that all I&#39;m saying is get all the facts before you worry about what you think is going to happen,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know what&#39;s going to happen, he&#39;ll get out, stay with my arsehole of a grandfather and then once he&#39;s finished fooling everyone that he&#39;s ok he&#39;ll get to see me,&#34; I snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He won&#39;t fool everyone,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes he will, he&#39;ll even fool you and then what,&#34; I said as my eyes started to water. He sighs and rubs his face with his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; he said, holding hands up in surrender, &#34;I&#39;ll go in on my own, you stay here,&#34;he said as he opened the car door. I sigh and look down at my lap. &#34;I&#39;m not angry with you before you start to think that, if anything I&#39;m just a bit confused as to why you don&#39;t want to know anything,&#34; he paused and sat with his legs out of the car. He sighs and turns to look at me, &#34;Come here,&#34; he said, moving his index finger back and forth. I slowly moved towards him and he leaned forward and kissed me on the cheek. &#34;You can explain to me when I get back,&#34;he said in my ear and pulled away. I watched him get out of the car and shut the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body heaved out a breath I didn&#39;t know it was holding and I closed my eyes tightly. How could he do this to me? I was completely full of anger with him a minute ago and it suddenly goes once he comes close to me. I clenched my fists and then brought my knees to my chest, took off my boots and rested my head on my knees. I would have never guessed from how calm he always seems or from looking at him that he was a former disaster. I knew there were other things he hadn&#39;t told me, I could tell from looking at him that he wanted to tell me something else but held back. I didn&#39;t mind him holding back on telling me things because I didn&#39;t tell him everything. After all, if I told him what truly happened between me and Brendan while I was with him I doubt he&#39;d be a very happy bunny.</p>
