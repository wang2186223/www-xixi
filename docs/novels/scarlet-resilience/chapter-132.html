                <p>&#34;Megan are you, oh my god I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; I hear Melanie say. I sigh as I feel Megan freeze, I look down at her knowing Melanie can&#39;t see it&#39;s her. &#34;As if,&#34; I hear Melanie say, &#34;You and Megan just broke up,&#34; she snaps. I look at Megan to see her holding her dress up. I grab my trouser and place my blue balled dick back in my boxers. Megan moves me to the side a little so she can show Melanie it&#39;s her. &#34;Megan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi,&#34; she says while moving her dress skirt back in place and hopping off the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see, you&#39;re back together, great,&#34; Melanie snides and I hear her shut the door. I look behind me to see she&#39;s gone. Megan sighs and leans her head against my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck sake,&#34; she groans. I chuckle and buckle my belt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Took the words right out of my mouth,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to go after her don&#39;t I?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, she obviously wanted to talk to you about something,&#34; I answered and move away from her to one of the panels at the wall. I push on it to reveal a toilet and sink. She raises an eyebrow. &#34;This estate belongs to me too,&#34; I state and she laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course it does,&#34; she says and walks up to the sink to wash her hands. I do the same. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she suddenly says and I frown at her. &#34;That you didn&#39;t get to finish,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s completely fine, we&#39;ll continue this later,&#34; I say and kiss her on the lips. She smiles and checks her hair in the mirror. &#34;You look beautiful, now go after her before I keep you here,&#34; I state. She gives me a quick smile before running out the door. The truth is I need to relieve myself, I can&#39;t go back out like this. I look at the desk to see her knickers are on the floor and I can&#39;t help but smile to myself. I wonder how long it will be until she realises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk into the ballroom to see the crowd had thinned out a little. Composing myself I look around for anyone I know and I see Yasmin stood with Carl at a high table. I quickly walk over and take a drink from a server as I get to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen Melanie?&#34; I ask. Yasmin turns to me and frowns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was looking for you, where have you been?&#34; she asks and before I can answer Carl buts in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I know that look, that post-orgasm glow, you&#39;ve been getting dirty,&#34; he mocks and I tap his arm with the back of my hand as I feel myself get embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Yasmin states in disbelief and looks from me to Carl. &#34;You sly minx,&#34; Yasmin says shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie, have you seen her? Since she was looking for me,&#34; I ask and down my glass of wine. Carl tilts his head and then laughs. &#34;No, whatever you are thinking stop,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Yasmin asks looking between us both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie walked in on them, let me guess Logan has blue balls now?&#34; he asks and Yasmin giggles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two are no help,&#34; I say, shaking my head at them and turn to scour the room for her. I sigh and move my hand through my hair. Carl grins at me and I roll my eyes at him. He&#39;s so carefree, I would have never guessed he had gone through such a terrible ordeal. I give him a small smile and look back out at the sea of people. I then notice her walking out of the doors that lead out onto a terrace. Walking quickly I set off to talk to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I&#39;m completely honest I&#39;m scared she&#39;s going to make me choose between them both, that she&#39;ll make it so I can&#39;t be with him and I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do if she does that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out, I quickly wrap my arms around myself at the small chill in the air, it is then I realise I&#39;m not wearing underwear. I feel a little embarrassed. I wonder if people can tell, I look down in interest and then behind me and back inside to see Logan stood staring at me. He gives me a knowing smirk before looking away. I feel myself becoming even more flushed, I look ahead of me and take a deep breath. If I calm my emotions no one could possibly tell that I&#39;m commando right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Focusing my attention back on Melanie, I see her stood at the wall looking out at the gardens and night sky. I stand next to her and nudge her with my shoulder a little. She looks at me and sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to hear it,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie, don&#39;t be like that,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what Megan, he treats you like shit, he hurts you all the time,&#34; she snaps and walks away from me to walk down the steps to the garden. I follow her so we&#39;re out of earshot of other people. I sit next to her on the bench. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me you were back together?&#34; she asks quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A few reasons really,&#34; I sigh looking down at my hands. &#34;The main one been his uncle. We were trying to keep it a secret from him as he was the reason we broke up in the first place. And the other is because I just knew you wouldn&#39;t be happy about it. You&#39;re my best friend and I really like Logan, he makes me happy, confident and me. I&#39;ve not felt like myself since my mom died and I forgot how it felt,&#34; I explain. She looks at me and I look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry I kissed you,&#34; she says guiltily. I laugh a little and place my hand on hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be, it doesn&#39;t bother me, it shocked me but it&#39;s not something you have to apologise for,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t even know where it came from, I just know I have feelings for you but it confuses me because I know I like men,&#34; she says in confusion. I sigh and give her hand a small squeeze. &#34;I feel like I&#39;m too old for this confusing phase,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How? People go through this stage all the time, there&#39;s nothing to say what age you should go through it, I&#39;ve had it, it was with you actually. I told my mom and she told me it was ok and to keep her updated. About a month later I got asked out by Tyler and my mom just told me the same thing I&#39;m going to tell you,&#34; I say and pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did she say?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She said she thinks everyone likes their best friend at some point in their life whether they be male or female, it&#39;s just our brains can&#39;t always determine what kind of love we have for them and when it does, we&#39;ll know,&#34; I explain. &#34;Don&#39;t get too hung up on the label, just be you,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know that you weren&#39;t actually attracted to me?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I fell for Tyler, I just knew what I felt for him was different to how I felt for you and given you&#39;re the only girl I&#39;ve found remotely attractive I kind of knew that it was a phase,&#34; I explain. &#34;Are there any other women you like?&#34; I ask. She sighs and looks down in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure what to tell you, maybe talk to Carl, or talk to your mom,&#34; I say unsure if the advice I&#39;m giving her is the right advice. &#34;I&#39;m being a shit friend aren&#39;t I?&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you&#39;re right, my mom is really open-minded, so I know she&#39;ll help me, I&#39;m just confused, I guess it&#39;s more I need to find out for myself,&#34; she explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want to put a name to it I&#39;d say you&#39;re more bi-curious,&#34; I pause &#34;that&#39;s a thing, right?&#34; I ask and she laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He really makes you happy?&#34; she asks. I nod and smile a little. &#34;Even after everything he&#39;s done,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, he made one mistake, the rest is just his character and I&#39;m ok with it, I know he&#39;ll always protect me and I feel that&#39;s what I need,&#34; I state and look back towards the Manor to see him stood watching us, David is stood next to him and it looks like he&#39;s telling him something as Logan nods along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as you&#39;re happy, I&#39;m happy but if he hurts you, I&#39;ll hurt him,&#34; she threatens and I laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So does this mean you&#39;ll try to get on with him?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we have a common ally that we both care for so I can do it for you,&#34; she admits and I smile and give her a hug. She laughs and hugs me back. &#34;So you and him have finally had sex?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I say quickly, pulling away to look at her. She tilts her head at me. &#34;We were doing other stuff,&#34; I mutter and feel my face heat up and she laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see,&#34; she states laughing. &#34;He does look very dapper in that tux although he&#39;s now missing his bowtie, he looks even hotter,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He does, what&#39;s annoying is he knows he looks good,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does he or is it more that he doesn&#39;t care?&#34; she asks and I shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure, all I&#39;m sure of is that I can&#39;t wait to get him naked,&#34; I say dreamily and she laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seems he&#39;s turned you into a pervert,&#34; she says standing up. I stand and follow her to the steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only for him,&#34; I say as we walk towards Logan. He gives us both a small smile and then turns to David.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go dance with your wife before she kills me for taking up all your time,&#34; he chuckles in response and walks away. Logan turns back to Melanie and I. &#34;Are we back friends?&#34; he asks. &#34;Everything is sorted?&#34; he adds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes and yes,&#34; I say moving my hand into his. He smiles and looks at Melanie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, she has agreed to be nice to you as long as you&#39;re good,&#34; I say happily. It&#39;s honestly a relief to know that they might actually get on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So forever?&#34; he asks with a grin. Melanie shakes her head a little and then gives me a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I better go apologise to my boyfriend, I&#39;ve been a total bitch these past two weeks,&#34; she states and walks away from us back inside the manor. Looking at Logan I narrow my eyes slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have my underwear?&#34; I ask quietly so no one can hear. He laughs and holds my white panties up at me. I snatch them out of his hand before anyone can see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was wondering when you&#39;d notice actually,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not funny,&#34; I pause and look around. &#34;Cover me while I put them back on,&#34; I state turning him around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the point? I intend to take them off again later,&#34; he states and I almost fall over at his statement as I move my legs to put my panties on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone&#39;s fairly confident,&#34; I state moving my arm into his once I&#39;ve righted my dress.</p>
