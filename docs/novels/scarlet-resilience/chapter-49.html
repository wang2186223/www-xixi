                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of my phone vibrating on my bedside table woke me. I yawned and reached over to it feeling Logan&#39;s arms tightly locked around my waist. I answered it without looking at the name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello,&#34; I said sleepily in a croaked voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were sleeping,&#34; the person stated. I yawned and mumbled under my breath. &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter,&#34; they say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is this?&#34; I ask  and turn the clock on my table round to see it said 3:36am. A sigh escaped me and I turned a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s me Brendan, I thought you wouldn&#39;t be sleeping but it&#39;s ok,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, go back to sleep, I&#39;ll explain more later on,&#34; he said and the line went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charming,&#34; I said and dropped my phone on my bedside table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was it?&#34; I hear Logan ask and move closer to me, his bare warm chest touching my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendan,&#34; I yawn and close my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did he want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know he wouldn&#39;t say, he said he&#39;ll tell me in the morning or something,&#34; I said and turned to look at him burying my head in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; he said sleepily and we both drifted off back to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I heard Logan say to me &#34;I&#39;m going ok, I&#39;ll be home at about half three ok,&#34; I heard him say. I opened my eyes to come face to face with his sky blue ones. He smiled and kissed my cheek &#34;go back to sleep I just wanted to tell you, Carl&#39;s going to be home all day so make sure you keep covered,&#34; he said with a small chuckle. I smile and stretch, gaining a small smile from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I have a kiss before you go?&#34; I ask and he leans in, laying a hand on my cheek and I smile pulling him in closer by his shirt. He then pulls back and kisses my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By babe,&#34; he said and walked out of my bedroom. I sigh and close my eyes trying to drift off back to sleep but it wasn&#39;t working. Not feeling his arms around me made me feel unsafe. I sat up and looked around and then sniffed. It smelt like soap. I looked at my bathroom door and from the mirror I could see it was steamed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charming has a shower in my bathroom and doesn&#39;t let me see him half naked,&#34; I said and lay back. I sigh and look at my phone and reach for it. Remembering the phone call last night, Brendan seemed a bit upset. I sighed and dialled his number and waited for an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello,&#34;he said sleepily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey it&#39;s Megan are you ok?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, yeah I got kicked out last night, my parents are insane,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? What happened?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh it&#39;s ok, I&#39;ll sort it. What are you doing today?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know yet, you?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know either, do you want me to come round?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can if you want, but later I need to get ready and sort some things out,&#34; I explained. I didn&#39;t need to sort anything out, I just wanted some time to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I&#39;ll phone you before I come down,&#34; he said &#34;Cya later,&#34; he said and the phone went dead. I sigh knowing Logan won&#39;t be very happy; he seemed to get jealous pretty easily which was a little annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl looked at me, narrowing his eyes, I did the same and gripped the guitar in my hand. He did the same. &#34;This is war,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right back at you,&#34; I said and looked at the screen and we started to play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god you&#39;re a girl you&#39;re not supposed to be a pro at games,&#34; and he started to strop. The reason for this strop was I had beaten him at guitar hero about five times in a row and we had only played six games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had also played COD which he had a great time playing as he was beating me at it. He then returned and folded his arms sulking like a little child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to let you win?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No because then it won&#39;t feel like a win,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to play COD?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know if you weren&#39;t going out with my best friend I&#39;d be going out with you,&#34; he states. &#34;You&#39;d be like the best girlfriend to a guy who is obsessed with COD,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm maybe,&#34; I said and turned the PS5 off and walked towards the Xbox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking into the house I could hear Carl playing in the games room. I looked at Melanie and Tyler. Tyler had asked me if he could come and see her and I couldn&#39;t say no when I was taking Melanie with me to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The son of a bitch just fucking killed me,&#34; I heard Megan say. I frowned and walked towards the games room with Melanie and Tyler behind me. I opened the door to see her sitting in one of the game chairs. I smirked watching her sat playing COD. &#34;That was your fault,&#34; she snapped at Carl and nudged him in his side. I looked at the screen and then Carl threw a grenade in her sight and then she was shot. &#34;Carl,&#34; she growled, standing up and yanking the remote out of his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t resist,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you,&#34; she said folding her arms and turning her back to him so she was now facing us. A smile went across her face as she got up from her seat. She walked towards Melanie and hugged her straight away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ooo love you too,&#34; Melanie said and Megan pulled back from her and then looked at Tyler and hugged him and then pulled back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl you can play by yourself,&#34; she snapped &#34;Cheater,&#34; she said under her breath and grabbed Melanie and dragged her up the stairs with Tyler not far behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Carl and he smiled cheekily at me. I sigh and walk over to him sitting in the chair Megan was in. &#34;I&#39;m going to kick your arse,&#34; I state and held the joy pad in my hands</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flopped back on my bed and they both looked at me, I smiled at them and sat up. They smile back and tackle me down telling me how much they&#39;ve missed me. I sigh and pat both their heads. Then after a few minutes we all just lay on my bed facing the bedroom ceiling. Not talking, just enjoying each other&#39;s company and silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Valentine&#39;s day next week,&#34; Tyler said randomly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I said sitting up. &#34;Is it?&#34; I ask. He nods and I sigh while flopping back down &#34;that sucks, that means I&#39;ll get pity roses off the teachers,&#34; I said to myself. They laugh at me and Tyler looks at me with a small smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll send you a rose,&#34; Tyler stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urgh don&#39;t you always send her one,&#34; Melanie says to him looking at him and rolling her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes but this will be the first time we won&#39;t be together,&#34; he states and for a brief moment sadness covered his eyes, I gave him a small smile and he soon smiled back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll send you a rose,&#34; I said, turning to look at Melanie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This Valentine&#39;s day is going to suck,&#34; I said quietly. They laugh at me and I start to laugh too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It might not,&#34; Melanie said after we stopped laughing. Me and Tyler both look at her &#34;This is the first year in four years we&#39;ve all been single for Valentine&#39;s Day because before you two decided to go out. Tyler had girlfriends and well you had one boyfriend before Tyler. So really this is the first time we&#39;ve been together on Valentine&#39;s Day single,&#34; she explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm true,&#34; I said and then I heard Logan shout for me, &#34;I&#39;ll be back in a few minutes, I think it&#39;s time for my pills, he has that tone,&#34; I said and sat up and walked out of my room shutting the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking into the kitchen I saw Logan standing, opening up my medication and putting it at the side of a glass full of water. I sigh and walk towards him and stand next to him watching him pop another pill out of its plastic bubble. I fold my arms as a question comes to mind as I watch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many women have you slept with?&#34; I ask. He stops and looks at me &#34;I&#39;m just wondering,&#34; I state and he sighs while putting the tablets back in their box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; he states. I raise an eyebrow and reach for the glass of water, &#34;Why are you wondering is that what you are talking about upstairs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope I was just thinking while looking at you because you look like a man that could have any girl so...&#34; I trail off and take a gulp of my water. &#34;I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s a lot,&#34; I state and reach for the big diamond shaped tablet and place it on the centre of my tongue and take a gulp of my water to flush it down my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you care?&#34; he asks, I shake my head, he sighs &#34;I don&#39;t really keep count but it is a lot, I was a bit of a playboy I guess,&#34; he states and looks down a little. I frowned at him. Why did it seem to make him sad?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter you know,&#34; I said and take his hand in mine. &#34;It isn&#39;t like you&#39;re one now. You&#39;re not are you?&#34; I ask quickly. He laughs and shakes his head at me and pulls me into a hug &#34;good cos I don&#39;t share,&#34; I say,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he laughs more and hold&#39;s me tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither do I,&#34; he states and pulls away &#34;now take your pills,&#34; he says. I sigh and turn around while he moves both his arms around my waist. &#34;So you&#39;ve been in this good mood for a full day now,&#34; he states. I smile</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any reason?&#34; he asks. I shake my head &#34;You&#39;re just happy?&#34; I nod and turn to look at him and give him a peck on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess these anti-depressants are just working,&#34; I said, causing him to sigh and nuzzle into my neck. &#34;Plus I have you and I haven&#39;t had a nightmare for a few days which is a relief,&#34; I state as I look away from him. He smiles and moves my head to look at him and kisses me on the lips. I smiled a little into the kiss and moved a hand through his hair, I then pulled back. &#34;Have you eaten apples today?&#34; I ask. He nods &#34;Hmm,&#34; I said and turned back to pick up my pills and take the rest. &#34;Do you want me to take the sleeping pills?&#34; I ask quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet,&#34; he said as he kissed my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m guessing I&#39;m due one of those shakes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes...you...are,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re clingy,&#34; I said and he stopped kissing me and looked at me &#34;I didn&#39;t mean it as a bad thing I&#39;m just not used to all this attention that you give me,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not always, I just haven&#39;t seen you since this morning and well I like kissing you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sexually frustrated?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? No!&#34; he said quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem like it,&#34; I said and then turned and wrapped my arms around his neck &#34;When was the last time you had sex?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sexually frustrated, now can we change the subject?&#34; he said &#34;that phone call last night did you find out why he decided to wake you up at that time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he said he&#39;s going to come and see me later but I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s coming now. He would normally be here by now,&#34; I paused. &#34;He likes to get here before you, normally because he doesn&#39;t like the look you give him,&#34; I explained. He smirks and kisses my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well whatever I&#39;m not really bothered to be honest, take that shake upstairs with you. I need to go out for a bit, me and Carl so be a good girl while I&#39;m gone,&#34; he said, taking his hands from around me and walking out of the kitchen. I walked to the fridge and opened it to take out a chocolate flavoured milkshake and walked out of the kitchen to the hallway to see Logan and Carl putting on their jackets. I give them both a small smile and walk up to my room.</p>
