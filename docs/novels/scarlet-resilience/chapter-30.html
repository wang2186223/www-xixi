                <p>**TPPV**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan looked at Logan as he pulled up into a parking spot. She knew where she was as she had visited it many times when she was a child to climb trees with her dad and with friends. It was a woods that had a dog walking area and walking area. It was well known for the animals that ran around the woods and it was a popular place for bird watchers. There was a river that ran through it with a waterfall. The land was owned by a family that lived close to where they were parked. The family also owned a well run and well populated cafe for tourists, bird watchers and hunters would visit whenever they needed a top up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got out of the car as Logan got out of the car and watched him take Max out of the back. The giant dog ran out and then ran round to Megan sniffing her and then went back to Logan. Logan let him jump on him as he put his lead on.  And then locked the car and walked round to Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want a coffee?&#34; he asks. Megan looked at him and then shook her head. &#34;I&#39;ll get you one because you&#39;ll probably want one in a bit to keep yourself warm.&#34;he said and then walked towards the cafe. He stopped at a window that had a woman standing waiting. Megan ran up to him and then stood beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Logan,&#34; a blonde girl said. She looked a little older than Megan. &#34;How are you? I haven&#39;t seen you in ages?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been in hospital that&#39;s why, I&#39;m not allowed to run as much,&#34; he states and then takes out his wallet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I&#39;d ask why but my dad said I shouldn&#39;t be nosy,&#34; she said smiling, showing off pearly whites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think he&#39;s right,&#34;he said, smiling a little. She huffed and then giggled. &#34;Can I have two large coffees?&#34; he asks &#34;Extra hot,&#34; he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure thing,&#34; she said, &#34;how many sugars?&#34; she asks. Logan looked at Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two in both please,&#34;he states. The girl nodded and took a quick glimpse at Megan and then walked off to do their coffee. After five minutes the girl returned with two large thermal coffee bottles. The type that held one and a half litres and had a cup attached to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;m guessing you thought the cups were going to be just ordinary size I put four in because this holds double as what the small holds.&#34; she states and placed them on the counter in front of them. Logan took one and handed it to Megan and then took the other. He handed the girl ten dollars and then walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep the change,&#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks you are paying for my night outs,&#34; she said smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every little helps,&#34; he said, turning and looking at the girl. She smiled and he turned back &#34;I need to get my cane,&#34;he said looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get it,&#34; she said and took the car keys from his hands. She opened the boot and took out his black cane and then shut it and turned to see him watching her. She smiled a little and started to walk towards him while pressing the button on the keys for the car to lock. Megan then ran over to him and handed him the cane and put his keys into his jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could have done that myself, I&#39;m not completely crippled,&#34; he said looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you not realise your hands are full?&#34; she asks. He frowned and looked and then smirked. &#34;Hmm I wonder if you have lost your sense of touch as well,&#34; she said as she took Max&#39;s lead out of his hand and walked off with his dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour had passed and they were by the river that ran through the woods. Megan and Logan were sitting on a bench while Max ran after a squirrel that was obviously toying with him. They hadn&#39;t spoken about much, they had mostly kept referring to the fact that Max and the squirrel almost looked like a cartoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I&#39;m guessing the girl that got us our coffee you had slept with,&#34; Megan stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you tell?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The look she gave you and then gave me and then gave you once more,&#34; she said &#34;it was almost as if she was replaying the night you had spent with her in her head when she looked at you,&#34; she paused &#34;not to mention she checked you out at least three times,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Observant I see,&#34;he states. Megan smiled a little and shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you have a friend who is like a trained spy you tend to pick up on some things,&#34; she paused and lent back while taking a sip of her coffee that was still remarkably warm. &#34;Plus I got used to reading body language,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it was just the once and I hardly remember, I think I was very drunk and I think she was too,&#34; he paused &#34;I&#39;m not too sure,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe, I don&#39;t know as I know nothing about the &#39;old&#39; you,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will do, you will know everything soon enough,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So start now then,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t really know where to start,&#34; he muttered &#34;I guess the beginning is always the best,&#34; he sighs &#34;I&#39;ve been seeing a psychiatrist since I was 11,&#34; he said suddenly &#34;ever since I told my father I hated him and told me mother that I thought she was nothing but an ice queen,&#34; he paused &#34;I was a violent person for a while,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How violent,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Violent enough to put someone I didn&#39;t know in a coma for three months,&#34; he says. Megan&#39;s eyes widened and she looked down at her coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you do that now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not to you,&#34;he says. She looked at him &#34;not to anyone who&#39;s important to me but I could to someone who has hurt the people important to me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s understandable,&#34; Megan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t used to think like that though, I pushed the people I care about away and when I met Stephanie she was the only person I let in and the only person I cared about. My aunt and uncle didn&#39;t like the fact me and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stephanie were together because of the influence she had on me,&#34; Logan paused and took a deep breath &#34;I was never home I was out partying and doing drugs,&#34; he started to explain &#34;I had so much money I didn&#39;t know what to do with it, I gave a load to a friend of mine so he could by a house that w3e could have parties in. I bought a car I didn&#39;t need as well I never like driving,&#34;he states &#34;I pretty much spent money because I didn&#39;t want it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do after Stephanie died?&#34; Megan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I became worse...this is where it all becomes dark really,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; she asks. He sighs and sat up moving his head on his hands while staring at his dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise you won&#39;t hate me,&#34;he says. Megan giggled a little and Logan looked at her his eyes wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, it&#39;s just hate you Logan I can&#39;t hate you no matter what you&#39;ve done because you&#39;ve always been really nice to me,&#34; she said after she had stopped laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan smiled a little and looked down, &#34;I nearly killed someone with my bare hands,&#34; he says. Megan gasped, her eyes shocked as she looked at him. &#34;I had originally hired someone to kill the man but I called it off and went after him myself. It was weird because back then I didn&#39;t have any fear of anything because I knew I could get myself out of any situation. Especially that night when I held a gun to that man&#39;s head I felt nothing but complete excitement. I felt joy in having that man&#39;s life in my hands to play with because I had complete control. It was the first time in a while that I had felt those kinds of emotions,&#34; Logan paused and looked at Megan to see the shock on her face &#34;I&#39;d understand if you hated me and if you never wanted to,&#34; he stopped when she hugged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would I hate you? That isn&#39;t the man I know,&#34; she said, holding him tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now I&#39;m not,&#34; he says. She pulled away and looked at him &#34;I&#39;m not doing so well right now and well I can feel myself slipping back into those ways and if I do then what?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happened?&#34; she asks. He looked away from her frowning at himself and rubbing his hands over his face. &#34;Is it me?&#34; she finally asked. He looked at her &#34;You&#39;ve only started acting like this since I got out of hospital, is it me?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? No. Never,&#34; he said softly and moved his fingers through her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...I can&#39;t tell you,&#34; he said and looked away from her. Megan sighs and puts her coffee down on the ground and moves her hands into her pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; she says. There was silence for a moment when she spoke again, &#34;Is it something to do with your ex-wife?&#34; she asks. Logan&#39;s eyes widened and he looked at her &#34;has it been the anniversary of her death or something?&#34; she asks. Logan sighs and looks away from her and as he nodded to her question he clenched his fists. Megan slowly moved her hand to his hands. &#34;It&#39;s ok,&#34; she said &#34;I understand you just feel lonely at the moment and well I don&#39;t exactly help when I keep leaning on you,&#34; she said and held his hand tighter &#34;I think maybe you should try leaning on me a little,&#34; she says. Logan sighs and turns his head to look away from her. Megan sighs and looks down at her feet. She didn&#39;t understand how she couldn&#39;t be any help to him. She had lost two people in her life that she loved dearly. Her mother was the first person and then her father to his illness. She thought she&#39;d be the best person to understand what he was going through but it seemed she didn&#39;t. She sighs heavily and takes her hand out of his and looks down at her lap. Her eyes slowly started to water &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she whispered. &#34;I&#39;m sorry for not being any help,&#34; she said, justifying her first apology. She felt his eyes on her and then his arms went around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are help, I&#39;m just an arse that&#39;s all,&#34;he said holding her. Then Max ran up to them making them both jump apart from each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you&#39;re done playing cat and mouse with the squirrel,&#34; Megan said looking at him and petting under his chin. Logan stood and looked down at them both. Megan looked up at him, gave him a small smile and then stood up. Logan bent down and picked up a stick throwing it far in the direction they were walking. Max jumped and ran after it. Megan&#39;s eyes trailed down Logan&#39;s back as he took his jacket off and she smiled a little and walked off. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t walk around with your jeans round your ankles, you&#39;ll fall,&#34; she said walking past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan looked down on himself and frowned a little confused, &#34;What do you mean?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m talking about the back, I just got a view of your boxers as I&#39;m sure the girls behind us did too,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you shouldn&#39;t be looking you pervert, violating me with your eyes like that,&#34; he huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not exactly hard to miss,&#34; she states, turning to face him. His jaw dropped &#34;I&#39;m not saying your arse is fat or big I mean the boxers aren&#39;t hard to miss when they are on a good looking man,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised an eyebrow &#34;Are you saying I&#39;m good looking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled and turned back round. &#34;Come on because I&#39;m not waiting for you,&#34; she says. Logan smirked and ran up to her. She looked up at him and then smiled.</p>
