                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were at this party and it seemed to drag. We&#39;ve been here for about two hours now and all I wanted to do was go home but I couldn&#39;t because of Melanie. I had watched Brendan give Cade the talk about if he hurt his sister he&#39;d be a dead man and if he tried to get further than first base with her he&#39;d cut his hands off or something. About two guys came to talk to me and Brendan kindly told them where to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going out for some air,&#34; I said to Brendan and get up and walk out of the room. He follows me out and doesn&#39;t say anything until we&#39;re fully outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; he said, grabbing my arm. I turn and look at him, he sighs and hugs me, I move my arms around him and let him hold me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel like I should cheat on him or something to get back at him to feel better,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes but if you do it&#39;ll just make things worse,&#34; he pauses and rubs my back &#34;you don&#39;t want that,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I&#39;m just so angry,&#34; I said, frowning and doing the same did seem like a really good idea because I know how angry he&#39;d get and then he&#39;d feel the pain I&#39;m feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If this is you angry I&#39;d hate to see you absolutely livid,&#34; he says. I smile a little &#34;I&#39;m serious you seem calm obviously upset but calm as well,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it&#39;s not going to get me anywhere if I go off on one about it is it,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s true it won&#39;t,&#34; he said and pulls away &#34;stop thinking about what&#39;s happened and just have fun,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t, I just want to be on my own for a bit,&#34; I said and pull away from him fully &#34;I&#39;ll be fine,&#34; I said and turn to walk to a bench.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get you a drink and then leave you for a bit,&#34; he said and walks off returning five minutes later with a bottle of Vodka for me with fruit fizz added to it. I smile and watch him walk off back to the party but looking back at me before going inside. I take a sip from the bottle and it wasn&#39;t strong but it wasn&#39;t weak either so I wasn&#39;t going to get completely hammered maybe between tipsy and drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours had passed before I had realised just how long I had been out here for. I wasn&#39;t even cold; Brendan had come out a few times to check on me and sat with me for a few minutes before walking back into the party. He wasn&#39;t drinking because he was mine and Melanie&#39;s ride home which was good because I was pretty much drunk now and from what he had told me so was Melanie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hold the phone to my ear waiting for him to answer, I couldn&#39;t even remember dialling his number, I remember thinking about it but here I was ringing him waiting for him to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I hear Brendan say. I look to see he has Melanie with him who didn&#39;t seem able to stand straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just calling him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Melanie said frowning. I sigh and look away from her covering my eyes as I still wait for him to answer. It then goes to voicemail. I frown down at my phone and put the phone down. &#34;The douche doesn&#39;t even answer probably out doing other random girls he won&#39;t know the name of,&#34; Melanie slurs. I frown and I can feel myself want to throw my phone at her head and it seems Brendan sees my frustration with her ad he takes her towards the car. He makes her lay in the back seat and then walks towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t talk to him now,&#34; he said taking my phone from me &#34;you&#39;re drunk and you just won&#39;t be able to make sense of anything,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I want to shout and scream at him,&#34; I said sadly. Maybe Melanie was right, maybe he was doing that and forgetting about me because he obviously forgot about me last night when he was holding another girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes and doing it down the phone in the middle of the night isn&#39;t going to solve anything. I know it seems logical right now and something you have the biggest urge to do but I&#39;m saving you from more trouble by stopping you,&#34; he explains to me. I sigh and he hugs me tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate him,&#34; I said quietly and he just sighs. He pulls me to my feet and takes me to the car so we can go home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting drunk was probably the worst thing for me to do because I was up all night crying keeping Brendan awake which I felt really bad about. This morning wasn&#39;t exactly great either because I felt like crap and looked it. I had already thrown up three times and now I was laid in Brendan&#39;s bed in my underwear because I was overheating. He had only just got to sleep and it was about half nine in the morning. So I didn&#39;t blame him for finally falling asleep on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk into the kitchen and smile at Melanie&#39;s dad and mom. They give me a smile back and I sit down at the island counter with them. I look around to see if Melanie was up at all and it seemed she wasn&#39;t. &#34;Am I the first one up?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Melanie came down not long ago and then went back up to her bedroom,&#34; Melanie&#39;s mom said to me. I sigh and look down &#34;Are you ok?&#34; she asks I nod and get up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to go and see Melanie,&#34; I said quietly and walk out of the kitchen and up to Melanie&#39;s room. I knock on her door and then open it to see her sat with a bowl of cereal watching TV. &#34;Hey,&#34; I said and sit down next to her &#34;are you ok?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yep you?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah a little bit tired though,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm I would be too after sleeping with my best friend&#39;s brother&#34; she said still not looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I ask &#34;I haven&#39;t slept with Brendan I slept in his bed if that&#39;s what you mean but it&#39;s obvious that isn&#39;t what you mean,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not stupid Megan, you were drunk and upset and you go off to sleep in his room it&#39;s not hard to put two and two together,&#34; she explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I didn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t and he wouldn&#39;t and it&#39;s just stupid for me to do that when Logan,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah who cheated on you,&#34; she said now looking at me and I feel a jolt of pain when she said that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would I do that to you?&#34; I ask &#34;and I&#39;m not even ready,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh please you&#39;re very far from being a virgin Megan,&#34; she snaps and I look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok so that makes me a slag, thanks,&#34; I said and walk out of her room. I take a deep breath and walk into Brendan&#39;s room. I sit on his bed and look at him, a growl escapes me and I push him off his bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa what?&#34; he said and sits up his hair sticking out all over the place and blinking a few times. He looks at me and tilts his head completely confused as to why I had pushed him off his own bed. &#34;Why did you just do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t do anything,&#34; I said acting oblivious to it &#34;you rolled over and smack,&#34; I said clapping my hands when I said &#39;smack&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you pushed me off my bed,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I didn&#39;t, you fell off it yourself,&#34; I said putting on my straightest face. He frowns and looks around, I smirk a little as he believed me. I then get rid of the smirk as he looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t done that since I was young though,&#34; he states. I shrug and he frowns more as he stands and gets back into bed and lays his head on the pillows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your sister thinks we slept together,&#34; I state. He opens his eyes and looks at me &#34;because I&#39;m very far from a virgin it&#39;s obvious I slept with you last night you know because that&#39;s what I do now that my father has taken my virginity,&#34; I said sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that what she sais?&#34; he asks. I nod and he sighs and pulls me down to him &#34;ignore her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I ignored her and then she says something to Logan. I don&#39;t think so,&#34; I sigh and hold my head in my hands. &#34;This is so annoying,&#34; I said and feel him pull me down to him. This is all I needed, my friend turning on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget about it honestly she&#39;s probably regretting what she&#39;s just said right now,&#34; he said &#34;just relax for once,&#34; he orders and moves an arm around me &#34;I for one could do with an extra six hours sleep, if you can&#39;t, watch a movie and forget about the drama for today,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said and lay next to him &#34;And I did push you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you I&#39;m very thankful for that, I love the bruise you&#39;ve given me,&#34; he said with his eyes closed. I smile and lay next to him, he was like the best friend in the world sometimes.</p>
