                <p>The noise from my classroom was predictable; leave a bunch of high school students with substitute teachers for several weeks; they&#39;re going to gain bad habits along the way. Boy were they going to get a shock when I walked through the door. I wasn&#39;t really that strict but if I needed to be I would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked into my class room and picked up the dictionary that was placed on my desk. I looked at them to see they were all in their little groups chatting away about what had happened over the weekend. A small sigh passed my lips and I slammed the book on my desk. They jumped and as soon as they saw me they sat down in their seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; I said and dropped my bag on the desk. &#34;Get in your assigned seats,&#34; I said as I opened up my bag. I could hear a lot of movement which told me they were all in the wrong seats. &#34;Did you all have a good weekend?&#34; I ask, gaining a few mutters &#34;how about Christmas?&#34; I ask, looking at them. &#34;Anyone want to share their Christmas?&#34; I paused, &#34;I could share you mine but it was dull,&#34; I said and took a wad of test papers out of my bag. &#34;Anyone at all?&#34; I asked  and a few hands slowly started to go up. &#34;Yes Natalie,&#34; I said, smiling at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went back home for Christmas,&#34; she said &#34;to see my grandparents,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you enjoy it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes and no, my grandfather passed away on Christmas eve,&#34; she said my eyes widened and I was about to said something &#34;oh don&#39;t be sorry he was well happy, he was getting on a bit I mean he was 97 and well he knew and we all knew it was going to happen so it was ok. My Grandma wasn&#39;t that sad either, I think it&#39;s because she was sick of him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Erm ok then,&#34; I said and stifled a chuckle as I closed my bag back up and placed it on the floor &#34;anyone else?&#34; I asked  and Courtney shot her hand up. She was what you would call a rich brat. &#34;Yes Courtney,&#34; I said and sat down in my chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well daddy,&#34; she started and I closed my eyes hoping this wasn&#39;t going to go on forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Daddy got dear Courtney a new car and took dear Courtney on his new yacht around the Bahamas and daddy,&#34; one of the very down to earth and very said it how it is girls said mocking her tone of voice. &#34;Only thing daddy didn&#39;t do for dear Courtney was push her off the damn yacht,&#34; she hissed. The class chuckled a little and Courtney huffed and folded her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just jealous because your daddy isn&#39;t as rich as mine,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well of course not you stupid cow my daddy is dead,&#34; she said mocking the way Courtney said daddy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh wow,&#34; I said putting my hands on my head and facing the ceiling and the room went silent. &#34;I&#39;m going to be crazy before I reach thirty,&#34; I mumbled and rubbed my eyes while facing the class again to see them all looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir,&#34; I heard a very quiet voice say. I looked around and it was the girl that always sat in the corner next to Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When is Megan going to be back?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next week,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she ok...I mean is she better than what she was because she&#39;s obviously not going to be ok,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes she is,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it true you&#39;re living with her now?&#34; Courtney asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m her guardian for now,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucky bitch,&#34; Courtney said to herself but loud enough for people to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How the fuck is she lucky?&#34; Melanie snapped. Courtney looked at her &#34;please tell me because I would love to know how she is suddenly lucky,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get on shall we,&#34; I said trying to distract her. Melanie stood up and walked towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on,&#34; she snapped, getting in her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just meant,&#34; Courtney began to stutter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just meant what? Because she hasn&#39;t exactly got a rich Daddy now has she? So she can&#39;t be lucky that way, so what is it then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie,&#34; I said standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you want to know sir how Megan is apparently a lucky bitch?&#34; she asks. I sigh and walk around my desk towards them. &#34;I&#39;ll give you something lucky if you like,&#34; she said and raised her fist and before I could get to them she punched her in the face. The boys in the class burst out laughing and an &#39;Ooo&#39; sound came from the class as Courtney started to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My nose,&#34; she cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie,&#34; I snapped and grabbed her arm. She turned to look at me and I saw her eyes watering. &#34;Go outside and cool down,&#34; I say. She heaved a deep breath and walked out of my classroom. I looked at Courtney to see her nose was now bleeding. &#34;Can someone take Courtney to the school nurse,&#34; I said walking away from Courtney and opening up my classroom door to see Melanie crouched down holding her head in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take her,&#34; Natalie said and stood up with Courtney and escorted her out of my classroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve broken my new nose,&#34; Courtney said to Melanie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aww you can just get &#39;Daddy to buy you a fucking new one can&#39;t you,&#34; she growled at her as she walked away. &#34;Spoilt bitch,&#34; she hissed. I sigh and shut my classroom door and folded my arms while looking at Melanie. She looked at me &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she said standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not really me you should be saying sorry to,&#34; I say. &#34;Now what&#39;s wrong, give me a good reason to not send you to detention,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She deserved it and you know it,&#34; she says. I sigh and smiled a little &#34;see you agree,&#34; she said with a smirk &#34;but you may as well give me detention because I did it because I wanted to,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know everything with Megan has affected you and make you question yourself as a friend but punching everyone in the face who said a comment about her you don&#39;t like isn&#39;t going to make you feel better,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go get your things and get to the head office,&#34; I said and opened the door. She sighs and walks back into my classroom and watches her pick her stuff up and then walk out. I shut the door and looked at the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you all have a test,&#34; I said with a smile. They all groaned &#34;oh what fun we will have,&#34; I said and picked up the test sheets and placed them on a boy&#39;s desk. &#34;Hand them out please,&#34; I said and walked to my desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have until the end of class to do it and when the bell goes leave your papers on my desk in a neat pile.&#34; I looked at them &#34;Don&#39;t worry I have something to do too, I need to read this book so you can all read it,&#34; I said smiling once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We hate you,&#34; one of the girls said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aww and I love you too,&#34; I said smiling and putting my hand to my chest. The girl blushed and looked down at the test in front of her. &#34;Enough fun, start and don&#39;t worry it&#39;s only so I know what has been taught to you while I&#39;ve been away,&#34; I said and sat down in my seat taking the book I needed to read and started to read it.</p>
