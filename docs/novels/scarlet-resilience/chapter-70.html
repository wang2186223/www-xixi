                <p>Walking out of Megan&#39;s bathroom in my towel I see her back from downstairs and sat on her bed. She gives me a small smile as I sit on her bed and lay back moving my hand over my eyes. I feel her move and then her head on my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The food smells nice.&#34; I say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I added some more sauce and turned the chicken over and turned it up a little,&#34; she said and I look at her and as I do she looks at me and smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got a cabin in Alaska, so we can go there if you like,&#34; I said moving my hand through her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm isn&#39;t it cold there like all the time,&#34; she said and smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No but at this time of year it is,&#34; I pause &#34;but if you think about it no one we know will be there so we could do this more,&#34; I said moving my hand into hers and moving my fingers between hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, that&#39;s true,&#34; she said &#34;in public too,&#34; she smiles and moves on top of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can pay for all of our flights too so no need to worry about that, I think things like this are like the good points of been a millionaire,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really don&#39;t understand why you teach if you have that much money,&#34; she said looking down at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I wanted to teach and I enjoy it and I don&#39;t want to live off of the money my parents earned, it&#39;s only there for things like this,&#34; I said and sit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So who&#39;s going to come with us?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Carl obviously he&#39;s like a child I can&#39;t leave him on his own for two weeks he&#39;ll feel left out,&#34; I said and she smiles &#34;I was thinking of asking Melanie, Yasmin, Julie and Scott and probably Brendan depending on how I see him today,&#34; I said and she leans in and gives me a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie may want her boyfriend to come,&#34; she said and I smile a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope she doesn&#39;t not at her age,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ew Logan really,&#34; she said looking away from me and I smirk and as I do she lets out a small chuckle &#34;you can be so dirty minded sometimes,&#34; she said and moves her hands around my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok her boyfriend can come too but they are not sharing bedrooms,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many bedroom&#39;s is there for all of us to be sleeping?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Six, someone will have to share and of course we&#39;d be sharing,&#34; I said and she looks down and nods &#34;do you not want to share with me?&#34; I ask confused, she shrugs and I frown at her she really did not know if she wanted to share with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just Melanie was really adamant on me breaking up with you and I just don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll be a good idea,&#34; she said and climbs off me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m off to get changed,&#34; I said and stand. It was my fault and I know that but it doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t feel a little hurt about it. I know it was just sharing a bed but it&#39;s the only time I get to hold her. I walk into my bedroom and shut my door, but I couldn&#39;t blame her I wouldn&#39;t want to share a bed with someone who had cheated on me. I should just be thankful enough that she has forgiven me. And I am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan moves his arms around me as I plate up the food. Melanie, Yasmin, Julie, Carl and Scott are in the living room. Melanie had told me that Brendan had a few things to take care of and then he would be here. I&#39;m proud of Logan for inviting him and he seemed ok when Melanie mentioned Brendan, which is rare because when I mention him he goes all cold and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to do anything?&#34; Logan asks as he rests his head on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I&#39;m ok, you&#39;ve done your part,&#34; I said and feel him kiss my neck. I move the salad and turn to look at him. &#34;I&#39;m sorry about earlier,&#34; I said and he frowns as I look into his blue eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, don&#39;t worry about it, I understand honestly,&#34; he said and moves his hands to cup my face. I smile and play with the bottom of his top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should join them,&#34; I said and he nods while pressing his forehead to mine and skims his nose against mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes divert to his lips and for the first time in a while I&#39;m craving him and wanting him to kiss me. I bite my bottom lip as he moves his hands down around my waist and pull me close to him. The feeling of his breath on my face sent a tingle down my spine and a smile crease on my face loving how close he is to me.  I tilt my head and our lips meet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips softly move against mine. I close my eyes and kiss him back. I feel him play with the ends of my hair as he licks my bottom lip. My mouth opens and his warm tongue caresses mine. We hadn&#39;t shared a kiss like this since I last stayed at Julie&#39;s. His grip tightens around me and I move my hands up around his neck and play with the hair at the nape of his neck and like always his hair is soft. I pull back and move onto my tip toes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess we can join them in a few minutes,&#34; I said causing him to smirk and kiss me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pull on the collar of his shirt as I our kiss deepens and becomes more passionate. My fingers run through his hair pulling on it a little. Logan lifts me up and places me on the counter. His hands move up my skirt and I pull him by his t-shirt closer to my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Megan,&#34; I hear Melanie said and I pull away from him and slide off the counter &#34;sorry,&#34; she said looking at us. I gulp and wipe my mouth. She sighs and walks out of the kitchen. I am actually quite scared of Melanie just because her feelings matter to me and I don&#39;t ever want to lose her as a friend and if it meant me being with Logan would cause her not to be my friend anymore then I would not be with him. I just hoped it wouldn&#39;t come to that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She hates me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes surprisingly more than she hated Tyler,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you have a minute can we talk?&#34; she asks from the outside the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah we can talk now,&#34; I said and move out of Logan&#39;s grasp. He grabs my hand and pulls me to him and kisses me. I giggle as he kisses me and move my hands to his head. &#34;Finish what I&#39;m doing,&#34; I snap and he smiles and nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; he said defeated and I turn and as I do he slaps my bum. I look at him to see him turned acting as if he didn&#39;t do anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pervert,&#34; I said and he turns I smile at him and stick my tongue out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk out of the kitchen to see Melanie stood waiting for me. She gives me a small smile and then looks down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we go to your room?&#34; she asks. I nod and we walk to my room. I sit on my bed and she sits opposite me. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she said and I look down &#34;I didn&#39;t mean what I say, I was just in a bad mood and I&#39;m sorry I took it out on you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; I said and look down &#34;we haven&#39;t exactly been best friends for a while and I want us to be friends again,&#34; I said and she smiles. &#34;And I know you&#39;re not in the best of moods with Logan but he&#39;s trying really hard,&#34; I said &#34;I can see that and I&#39;m sure you can,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes but I&#39;m not just going to forgive him like you have. He really hurt you and don&#39;t you think you&#39;ve been through enough crap?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe I&#39;m made to go through all this to get something good,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah because getting raped by your father and then having your boyfriend cheat on you with some skank means you&#39;re going to get something good out of it,&#34; she sarcastically tells me. I feel myself slowly start to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well what am I supposed to think? Because that is all I can see from all of this, do you think I&#39;m not angry and hurt at what he did? Because I am I still am,&#34; I cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah cause it looked like that when he had his tongue down your throat a minute ago,&#34; she pauses and looks away from me &#34;I don&#39;t think he&#39;s good enough for you and you can stay with him but don&#39;t expect me to be nice to him, he does one more thing to hurt you and I will make sure your relationship never works,&#34; she growls and I can&#39;t find myself to be angry at her because I know why she&#39;s saying it.  She cares about me enough to do something that she knows will probably hurt me but be the best for me almost like a mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said &#34;will you tell them I&#39;ll be down in a few minutes,&#34; I said and wipe my eyes. She nods and climbs off my bed. She walks towards me and hugs me and then walks out of my room. I sit at the edge of my bed and run my hands through my hair and as I do my bedroom door opens again. I look to see Logan stood there.</p>
