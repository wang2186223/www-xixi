                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t really want to talk about it,&#34; she states and runs a hand through her hair &#34;well I guess I&#39;ll go to lunch now,&#34; she said and walks out of my classroom.</p>

                <p>&#34;How can I help you?&#34; I ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just came to talk to you about Megan see how she&#39;s getting on and stuff,&#34; she answers and it&#39;s only then I notice the notebook and pen in her hand. &#34;I&#39;m just using it to track her so that I know if she&#39;s keeping up with school; her grandfather asked me if I could do it really. But I think it&#39;s a good idea just so we know if she actually is alright,&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;How come she wasn&#39;t in yesterday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wasn&#39;t in the best of moods,&#34; I state &#34;her depression really, she hasn&#39;t had her antidepressants for most of last week,&#34; I state. &#34;She hadn&#39;t actually been home for most of last week, she got annoyed with me and I didn&#39;t see her,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you coping with her? Because it can be hard for you too, not just her,&#34; she states and I nod &#34;are you sure?&#34; I nod again &#34;Ok, are you still having physiotherapy?&#34; she asks and I shake my head.&#34;Ok,&#34; she said and this goes on for pretty much most of my lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie said yes,&#34; I said looking at Logan, he&#39;s sat the desk we have in the living room reading the Quizzes he made us do this morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good,&#34; he said and I get up and walk towards him. I move my arms around him moving my hands over his bare chest. I look to see he was reading mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to pass me?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; he said and I smile. &#34;You got a C on this,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A C!&#34; I said, snatching it out of his hand &#34;How?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you got questions wrong,&#34; he states and takes the test out of my hand. &#34;I&#39;m fair you know, and a C is a pass,&#34; he said and placed it on the already marked file.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And well what did you expect when you missed my last few lessons, they were on my last few lessons,&#34; he states and looks at me &#34;so you did well to say you didn&#39;t know everything,&#34; he said and kissed me on the lips.  I huff and kiss his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can Brendan come with us to England?&#34; I ask. He stops marking the tests he&#39;s marking and looks at me. &#34;Please?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you wanted me to say sorry to the guy not having a holiday with him too,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. It doesn&#39;t matter, forget I ask ,&#34; I state. &#34;Melanie and Julie can come. I&#39;m just waiting for Yasmin to phone me and tell me if she can,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cool, Carl&#39;s definitely coming, he couldn&#39;t hide his excitement, Scott&#39;s coming and James can&#39;t because him and Carl still aren&#39;t friends,&#34; he pauses &#34;so you might as well ask Melanie if she wants to bring her boyfriend and ask Brendan if you like,&#34; he explains and reaches for his glasses. I smile to myself because he looked super hot with his glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; I ask. He nods, I kiss him on the cheek and run a hand through his hair &#34;Now go do something entertaining because you are distracting me,&#34; he said and looked at me. I smile and stand up straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OK then,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And don&#39;t forget to tell them all that I&#39;m paying for their flights and food and that they will only want money for doing stuff nothing else,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will do,&#34; I say. &#34;You&#39;re spending some of your money?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never said I didn&#39;t use it for pleasure every now and then,&#34; he said and took his glasses off and looked at me as he placed them to his lips while looking me up and down. &#34;And you&#39;re pleasure,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, I think,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirks and I walk towards him putting my phone back in my pocket. His hand moves into mine and he pulls me onto his lap. I move my hands around him and lean in to kiss him. His hand moves up my skirt. I pull back and he starts to kiss and nip my neck. The feeling of my phone vibrating makes me pull away fully and he pretty much lifts me off my feet as he lifts me off his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your phone was pressing against me in the wrong way,&#34; he said and I laughed a little. &#34;Like I said go do something entertaining,&#34; he said and I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was,&#34; I said, taking my phone out of my pocket and answering it and he looked at me. I give him a smile and walk into the kitchen with my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you asked him yet?&#34; Melanie asks me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ask him what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did he speak to Courtney about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No not yet,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I can&#39;t believe Chloe turned up though, she swore when she left she&#39;d never step foot in that school again after she graduated,&#34; she said and I sigh. &#34;So do you believe him?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah it isn&#39;t like he&#39;s lied to me about anything,&#34; I pause &#34;Do you think I shouldn&#39;t have?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you&#39;re right he hasn&#39;t lied and well if they did do something I doubt he would have told you that she suggested they do it again,&#34; Melanie pauses &#34;did you ask Chloe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I asked  her over facebook and she said the same as him and that she&#39;d suggested it because she wanted to see if he was an actual scumbag,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah that sounds like Chloe, its funny how she&#39;s Courtney&#39;s sister they are like polar opposites,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah and apparently he asked her if they had used protection and was obviously very relieved when she said they did and when she suggested they do it again he called her stupid,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;d believe him then,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cool, oh will you ask Brendan if he wants to come to England?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah Logan said he could come,&#34; I state. &#34;Also, do you want to go shopping with me on Saturday?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes and yes, I need to go because Cade is coming round,&#34; she pauses &#34;my dad has ordered that he meets him now,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aww good luck with that,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not me who needs good luck and I cannot tell him that Cade is coming with us to England or I won&#39;t be able to go,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes that would be bad,&#34; I said &#34;well call me tonight and tell me how it goes,&#34; I said &#34;cya,&#34; I said and put the phone down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk back into the living room and sit on the couch. I could ask him why he went outside with Courtney but I didn&#39;t fully see the point. He couldn&#39;t do anything bad in the short time they were out there and it wasn&#39;t like Courtney returned with a smile on her face. She actually looked very pissed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s troubling you?&#34; I hear Logan ask. I look at him to see him still marking. He then turns in his chair and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you go outside with Courtney?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To tell her off, what she did was inappropriate, I told her if she is going to continue pulling stunts like she is then she will be moved out of my class,&#34; he said and takes his glasses off. &#34;Is that all?&#34; he asks. I nod in response and look at the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m off shopping this Saturday with Melanie,&#34; I said and I get a grunt in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you taken your medication today?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to take it, I don&#39;t even need them,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; he said &#34;and by the way we&#39;re having dinner at your grandfather&#39;s on Sunday after your session,&#34; he said and I sigh. I don&#39;t normally have a session on Sunday&#39;s but because we are going away I had to have one to set up video sessions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wants to see you that&#39;s why and to make sure I&#39;m looking after you properly,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s probably most likely got some bad news for me again, something like my father has escaped his mental asylum and is on the hunt for me,&#34; I said and I hear his pen drop. I look to see him looking at me &#34;It can happen,&#34; I said and he sighs &#34;or that my father is being released without a trial in a few weeks,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well if that&#39;s the case Megan we&#39;ll think about it then,&#34; he said and I get the feeling one of my options is right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, don&#39;t you,&#34; I said, turning fully to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said it was to do with your father as well but I don&#39;t know what,&#34; he says. I get up from my seat and walk out of the living room. &#34;Megan,&#34; he said calling after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t say anything; I just walk up the stairs to my room and sit in it. There were only three possible reasons my grandfather would want to talk about my father to me. The two I mentioned downstairs and the good reason and that he would be getting trialled and could be facing life. The third one didn&#39;t seem very likely at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Poppet,&#34; I hear Carl said and then knock on my door. &#34;What has that hot mess downstairs done now?&#34; he asks. I sigh and don&#39;t answer him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I technically haven&#39;t done anything,&#34; I hear Logan say to Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guess what I did last night,&#34; Carl said and then I heard Logan freak out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t touch me with the hand you used you sick boy,&#34; Logan growls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d touch you with my manhood but I think I&#39;ll leave that for later,&#34; he says and I laugh. I stand and walk towards my door and open it to see them both standing there. &#34;Or I can now,&#34; he states and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if it&#39;s bad news?&#34; I ask Logan. He sighs and looks at Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t really do anything if it&#39;s bad,&#34; Carl said and leans against my door frame. &#34;But what we can do is make sure nothing bad happens to you,&#34; he said and smiles.</p>
