                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyler ended up getting suspended. Megan got a warning for fighting, which didn&#39;t seem fair when she was just defending herself. From the buzz around the school, I don&#39;t think Tyler is coming back. By the sound of things, his dad is sending him to some sort of army school. I kind of believe it because I met his father when they came to collect him; he did not seem happy. He apologised to Megan for his son&#39;s behaviour. Megan didn&#39;t seem too fussed to be honest, which worries me a little. She should want him to be punished in some way for how he treated her. If I wasn&#39;t there and he&#39;d hit her, what would she have done? Just allowed him to do it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the week was pretty uneventful. After Megan had put to bed most of the rumours about her, it looks like no one believes half the people that say they have slept with her. Seen as everyone knows she slept with Tyler and Melanie&#39;s brother the other people that had said they had, have ended up confessing they were either lying or never actually said they had slept with her and that people took it like that. Which is true because I know I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had also found out that Melanie isn&#39;t friends with Megan anymore, Yasmin and Julie were, but Melanie had fallen out with her. I had heard this from Melanie&#39;s mother. She told me in this week&#39;s session. I only started coming to sessions about two weeks ago, mostly because David makes me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out of Susan&#39;s office, I take note of what she had said about my anger towards Tyler. She explained it was good I refrained from pulling his head off his shoulders and shoving it up his arse. It may be good, but it doesn&#39;t feel like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the front door opens, Brendon and Megan walk in. He pulls her to him and kisses her but looks at me as he does it. This is the second time he&#39;s done this, and I&#39;ve had enough. Two can play this game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Susan,&#34; I say, turning to look at her. Megan pulls away from Brendan once she hears my voice. &#34;I don&#39;t think I can continue coming to sessions, not when my files aren&#39;t safe here,&#34; I say. She frowns at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean? They&#39;re safe,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well your son has read my file and decided to blackmail me with it, so I don&#39;t think they are,&#34; I explain and I see the colour drain from her face as she looks at Brendon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Is this true Brendon?&#34; she asks him. Megan looks at him and takes her hand from him. He looks at his mother than at Megan to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not,&#34; he lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would he say that then?&#34; Megan asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just, I, you were dating him, and I didn&#39;t trust him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god,&#34; Susan says, and I see the tears in her eyes. &#34;Do you have any idea what you could cost me,&#34; she shouts at him. She then turns to me. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry. I don&#39;t know what else to say, I,&#34; she looks lost for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s not your fault; I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise for me to keep having sessions if they&#39;re here and if my history is all here too,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I completely understand,&#34; she says, and she&#39;s shaking her head in disbelief. Her husband walks in from the living room. &#34;Get out of my sight Brendon,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get him out of my sight,&#34; she snaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, I&#39;m sorry, I just,&#34; he then turns to Megan. She steps away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you blackmail him?&#34; she asks. Melanie then walks in through the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey all,&#34; she says and then glares at Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should leave,&#34; I say. Susan nods and apologises to me again. I glance at Brendon to see him glaring at me, and I can&#39;t help but give him a small smirk before I leave. I guess he thought I&#39;d forgotten about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking to my car, I hear the front door open and shut behind me and then Megan calls my name. I turn to look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I come home with you?&#34; she asks, &#34;I don&#39;t really want to stay for the shouting that&#39;s going to happen in there,&#34; she states. I nod and watch her walk around my car. She&#39;s wearing different clothes to what she&#39;s been recently wearing. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen her wear a dress since the warehouse. She&#39;s wearing jeans and one of my t-shirts. I wonder if she knows it&#39;s mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting into the car, I look at her. She gives me a small smile as she puts her seatbelt on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know he did that,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you didn&#39;t,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s really annoyed me, he shouldn&#39;t have done it regardless of how he felt about you, boys are such dicks,&#34; she huffs, and I chuckle. &#34;It&#39;s true, first Tyler and now Brendon,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s your arm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it&#39;s good, I still can&#39;t believe he was going to hit me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He would be dead right now if he had,&#34; I state and she looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I kind of figured when I saw you pin him to the lockers,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The nurse said you broke his nose,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, I should really thank David for training me so well,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I think he trained you too well,&#34; We haven&#39;t spoken to each other about the fact I&#39;m holding Jonathon captive, I&#39;m not sure if she is choosing to act like she doesn&#39;t know, or if she is doing it to save face. &#34;How are your sessions going?&#34; I ask, knowing she had probably just got back from one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, Sara is treating me for PTSD, and my medication needs reviewing, she said that I should continue with the exercise as that will help me and to try and spend time on myself, whatever that means,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok with that?&#34; she shrugs in response and looks out the window. &#34;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m ok with anymore,&#34; she mutters. I notice the sad look on her face.</p>
