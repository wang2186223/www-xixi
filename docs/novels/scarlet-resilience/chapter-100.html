                <p>Silence laces over us as I look out of the window on my side. &#34;Is that what you want,&#34; he suddenly says. I look at him to see him frowning at me &#34;for us to argue?&#34; he asks. I shake my head. &#34;Sure seems like you do,&#34; he mutters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want the tension between us to go,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What fucking tension,&#34; he snaps. I sigh and look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter, you told me you want us to have a good day, let&#39;s just drop it,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you&#39;ve brought it fucking up so tell me what this tension is,&#34; he says and I look at him to see him glaring at me. I gulp the lump in my throat down and just as I&#39;m about to say something the driver interrupts through a speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re here sir,&#34; he says and he looks towards the driver and presses a button at the side of him to lower the screen divider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Logan says and the car comes to a halt. Logan gets out of the car and slams the door shut behind him. I sigh and look down, I don&#39;t know what to say to him, I&#39;ve ruined today for him and it hasn&#39;t even started. I just ruin everything. My car door opens and I look to see David. I give him a small smile and climb out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry miss, Logan has a habit of being cranky when he&#39;s hungry, he&#39;s like a baby just bigger,&#34; he says and I smile a little as I walk away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Logan to see him looking at me. I walk towards him and look at what we&#39;re stood in front of at it&#39;s a cute little cafe. I feel Logan touch my hand, I flinch and shiver. The way he looked at me in the car scared me. I fold my arms across my chest and then feel his hand on the lower part of my back. He leads me into the small posh looking coffee shop. We walk in to see a girl stood waiting. She looks at us and gives us a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Peters I presume,&#34; she says her strong French accent making her English sound hard to understand. Logan nods and she smiles &#34;if you&#39;d like to follow,&#34; she says. We follow her through the cafe and it seems to be a lot bigger than it looks. She leads us to the back of the cafe/restaurant and looks at us and smiles as she stops at a table her smile fades as she looks at Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is our table?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, would you like to sit somewhere else?&#34; she asks. &#34;Although it is one of the best seats...&#34; she trails off as Logan shakes his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would like to sit somewhere more secluded please,&#34; he says and I can tell by the look on his face he&#39;s still angry and he&#39;s trying his best not to snap at the woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Certainly sir,&#34; she says and she looks really flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; I suddenly say and she looks at me &#34;this table is fine ignore him,&#34; I say and sit down at the table. I look at Logan and he glares at me. I gulped and held my stare at him, he wasn&#39;t going to force me down with that stare of his like he just has with this woman. &#34;Sit down honey,&#34; I say with a tilt of my head and smiling at him. He breathes out through his nose and sits down in the chair opposite me. &#34;See its fine,&#34; I say to the woman. She nods and hands us some menus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any drinks?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Water is fine for me,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. Why don&#39;t you ask my darling?&#34; Logan says in a sarcastic tone towards me giving me the same obvious fake smile that I gave him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Water for him then too,&#34; I say. She nods and walks away from us. &#34;What is your problem?&#34; I ask. &#34;There&#39;s no one hardly in here,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know exactly what my problem is,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shall we just leave then?&#34; I ask. He shakes his head and looks away from me. I open the menu and silence laces over us. Fortunately the menu is in English. I know the tiniest of French but not enough to get by in France.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman returns placing two glasses of ice in front of us along with a fancy glass jug of water a small bowl of sliced lemons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything else?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A cup of tea please,&#34; Logan says. She nods with a small smile and walks away. I look away from him back to the menu. I&#39;m not that hungry but I wouldn&#39;t mind a soup. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I hear Logan say. I close the menu and look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With what you said you&#39;re right we do need to talk about that stuff, I just feel that talking about it all at once wouldn&#39;t solve anything, One thing at a time ok?&#34; he asks. I nod and look down. He reaches for my hands but I move them off the table. &#34;I scared you,&#34; he states. I nod and look away from him. &#34;I&#39;m sorry I never meant to scare you I was just angry I want to go at least a day without arguing and thinking about all this negative crap we have going on,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know so do I but I can&#39;t help thinking about it,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; he says and moves his hands in front of his mouth. &#34;What would you like to talk about first?&#34; he asks. I shrug and he sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t really want to pick a subject to talk about,&#34; I state. He moves one of his hands down at the napkin in front of him and looks towards the waitress who is on her way over with a pot of tea. She places a small teapot on the table and a cup with a small bowl of sugar and jug of milk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; he says. She smiles and walks away. I watch him pour the silk hot liquid of the tea into his white china cup. &#34;Tea always calms me down,&#34; he says quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So next time I feel like you&#39;re going to hit me I should just give you a cup of tea,&#34; I say. &#34;If only another man in my life was that easy,&#34; I say quietly and he just looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You thought I was going to hit you,&#34; he says. I nod a little &#34;I&#39;d never, just because I was angry at you doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll suddenly start hitting you,&#34; he says frowning at me. &#34;You should know this by now,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How am I supposed to know that?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan I&#39;ve told you countless of times that I&#39;d never hit you,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You saying that doesn&#39;t suddenly stop me from being scared of you,&#34; I snap. &#34;You shout and snap at me all the time and the way you look at me sometimes it&#39;s like you want to,&#34; I say. &#34;You&#39;re always angry,&#34; I say. He puts down the teapot and stands up. I look up at him and he walks away from our table. I gulp and look down. I can&#39;t help how he makes me feel sometimes. I know I have no real reason to be scared of him but I can&#39;t stop myself. I don&#39;t know why I feel it, it&#39;s just I have noticed a lot that he gets angry easily.</p>
