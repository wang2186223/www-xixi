                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking Logan&#39;s hand in mine as I catch up to him. I had stopped to look in a boutique window and he seemed engrossed in his phone. I lean in to see him looking at a website.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you planning?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m planning on not going back to England tonight,&#34; he looks at me with a small smile on his face &#34;do you want to stay here the night and go after breakfast?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm, I don&#39;t know,&#34; I say and scratch the side of my head with my index finger. I have noticed how we&#39;re a lot more touchy feely and if I&#39;m honest I&#39;m nervous about spending the night with him here. Maybe it&#39;s with how I&#39;m feeling. I feel like he&#39;s expecting us to go further in our relationship tonight. He hasn&#39;t done anything in particular to make me feel this pressure. It was more I, maybe because I want to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think about it, if we go back it means putting up with my uncle first thing in the morning,&#34; he states. I smile and move my hand out of his hand and around his waist. His arm moves around my shoulders and he kisses me at the side of my head as he pulls me close to him. He moves his phone into his pocket and looks at me &#34;I&#39;ve just booked us a table at a restaurant,&#34; he states. &#34;David will pick us up in an hour. Do you want to do something while we wait?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we go sightseeing more?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure I guess,&#34; he says and he doesn&#39;t look too pleased. I smile at him and move his hand into mine and pull him with me across a bridge. I stop at the railing of the bridge and look down at the river boats going by. His arms move around my waist and he hugs me tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do wish we could stay here forever,&#34; I say as I hold my camera up at the view in front of me. I press the button on the camera and hear a click and then a beep. Pulling the camera in front of me I look at the picture I&#39;ve just taken. Logan leans over resting his chin on my shoulder as I flick through some of the pictures I had taken today so far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long have you had this camera?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A while I think my mother bought me it for my birthday, I&#39;m not sure,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me see your pictures,&#34; he says, moving his hand over mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile watching him flick through all my photographs. Images of me and the girls along with pictures of Max that I had taken when we were at home come into view. Slowly we start to flick through pictures that I took before I met Logan and a picture of me and Tyler comes into view. He presses the button again and again. It&#39;s a picture of Tyler and this time I&#39;m kissing his cheek with a small smile on my face. He presses the button again to see a video playing. I frown not knowing I even had a video on my camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A video too,&#34; Logan exclaims. I look at him and then back at my camera to see it&#39;s of me laid in bed asleep and I recognise the bedding anywhere. It&#39;s Tyler&#39;s bedding. The camera moves towards Tyler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#39;When you finally watch this you will realise I&#39;ve done something terrible while you were asleep,&#39; Tyler says into the camera and then the camera turns back towards me and he pulls back the covers to show my naked back covered in pen and it&#39;s now I remember this video and our morning. I&#39;m only wearing my bra and panties in the whole video.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe we shouldn&#39;t watch this,&#34; I state as I put my hand over the camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I want to,&#34; Logan says moving my hand and holding me tightly with his other hand. I sigh and watch the video of me and Tyler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#39;Now let me explain my art work,&#39; Tyler says &#39;It&#39;s all just practice and any future tattoo suggesting if you ever think of getting one,&#39; he says &#39;plus I think I was still a little drunk when I started. Look.&#39;* He says as he scrolls the camera up my back showing an angel with black wings, a devil with a knife between it&#39;s teeth and then a heart with Tyler&#39;s name written underneath it and a load of little doodles like stars and music notes. And I suddenly remember having to wash all of this off my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*Tyler what are you doing?&#34; I hear my voice say sleepily.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Nothing,&#34; he says and the camera is on my face. &#34;Did you sleep well?&#34; he asks.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;I guess,&#34; I say and turn on my back. &#34;Put the camera away,&#34; I say and stretch I noticed it&#39;s way before I started losing weight.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;You look really good there,&#34; Logan says.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Does it worry you that I&#39;m about 15 there?&#34; I ask. Logan laughs a little and raises an eyebrow.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;You would not think your 15,&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Hmm maybe,&#34; I say and watch as Tyler carries on asking me questions and ignoring me when I tell him to put the camera away.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Tyler,&#34; my voice demands. &#34;If you do not get that thing out my face you see this,&#34; and the camera shakes and Tyler seethes in a breath.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Ah your twisting,&#34; he says and I realise I&#39;ve got him by the nads.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;I&#39;ll twist it off,&#34; I threaten.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;I&#39;m sorry, just let go and I&#39;ll take the camera away,&#34; he says.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Good,&#34; I say and my eyes close and my hand moves under the pillow. &#34;I have a hangover,&#34; I say and get comfy.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;I love you,&#34; he says and I sigh.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Love you too now let me sleep prick,&#34; I say and he laughs.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;As long as you love me,&#34; he says.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Yeah yeah,&#34;* I say and I watch as my head turns away from the camera and I hear him laughing. The camera then cuts off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remind me not to wake you up when you have a hangover,&#34; Logan says and I giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was the old me and I think Tyler had pissed me off the night before,&#34; I explain. He smiles and takes the camera in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s have a picture together,&#34; he says</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? But someone may see it,&#34; I say surprised he&#39;d even suggest that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one but you and me will see it,&#34; he says holds the camera to face us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take it with your phone just to make sure,&#34; I say. He nods and lets go of the camera. I put it back in my pocket and watch as he gets out his phone and holds it in front of us. &#34;Don&#39;t save it as anything, I don&#39;t want people seeing it,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok I won&#39;t,&#34; he says and I smile and kiss his cheek. &#34;That&#39;s a picture I&#39;m saving,&#34; he says and I smile and look at the phone to see a picture of me kissing his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more and then no others,&#34; I say and look at the camera and smile. He holds the phone away from us and takes a picture.</p>
