                <p>I&#39;m not upset over what his uncle has told me, I&#39;m upset at the fact he hasn&#39;t. Yes, he told me he had a rough past but he made it sound like he was just a troubled teenager over his parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What&#39;s more upsetting is that I can&#39;t defend him. He said himself he&#39;s an addict. Maybe what his uncle said is true and sooner or later he&#39;ll drop me. Taking a shaky breath I stand and walk towards the large bay windows. I can&#39;t see outside with it being dark but I can see my reflection. Dabbing around my eyes I try to make it look like I&#39;ve not been sat here crying over what his arsehole of an uncle has said to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opens, I look to see his uncle. I inwardly grown at the sight of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want? Have you not said enough to me?&#34; I snap. He walks towards me and goes to touch my hair. &#34;What are you doing?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t done talking to you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great,&#34; I say with a role of my eyes, it&#39;s then I realise he&#39;s blocking my only way out and he&#39;s way too close for my liking. I step back slightly. &#34;We aren&#39;t even together anymore so why are you even telling me the things you are?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not stupid, I can see the way you both look at each other, I want to make sure that when you go back to America you don&#39;t get it into your stupid heads to start again,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you even care so much? Even if Logan and I were together it doesn&#39;t affect you,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes it does,&#34; he snaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No it doesn&#39;t, you&#39;re just being spiteful, you don&#39;t want him to be happy,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he doesn&#39;t deserve to have everything handed to him, why should I allow him to have someone he loves as well as a company that belongs to me, it&#39;s my blood, sweat and tears that have made this company, I was the one that built this with my brother. He&#39;s just a spoilt rich brat that got this handed to him,&#34; he yells at me all the while clenching his fists. I gulp down my panic and try my best to back away from him. I feel my fear crawl up from my stomach and up my throat making my mouth dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swings open, Logan walks in with David behind him. David walks past Logan. He grabs his uncle and shoves him into the chair I was originally sat in. Logan walks towards me and pulls me into a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; he asks in my ear. He pulls away and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t do anything to her if that&#39;s what you&#39;re wondering, I&#39;m not a monster,&#34; his uncle says in a bored tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan pulls out the chair at the other side of the desk and leads me to sit in it. David pulls a brown envelope out of his jacket pocket and places it in front of Logan&#39;s uncle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s this?&#34; he asks picking it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open it and find out,&#34; Logan states. I look up at him to see the coldness in his eyes. I look back at his uncle to see him opening the brown envelope and looking through what seems to be pictures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been busy,&#34; he says and looks up at Logan. Logan pulls some papers out of his jacket. He makes two piles on the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So have you, I&#39;ve seen the money you&#39;ve been hiding and the &#39;businesses&#39; you&#39;ve been making under my business,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your business?&#34; He snaps. &#34;I&#39;m the one that built it,&#34; he says standing up. David places his hands on his shoulder pushing him back down onto his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have two choices, you sign these papers, giving full control back to me and an NDA and you get 10 Million, or I show those pictures to your wife and the police and these documents to the HMRC,&#34; Logan explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d sign them if I were you,&#34; David states, &#34;You don&#39;t want to go inside, you&#39;ll be someone&#39;s bitch in a heartbeat, plus people like you aren&#39;t liked in prison,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All of this is enough to put you away for a very long time,&#34; Logan says calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What for?&#34; I ask. Logan looks down at me and I watch the coldness leave his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trafficking: human, drugs, sex and children,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You act like I did it all myself,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you just funded it to make money, you should know that all your accounts are empty right now,&#34; Logan states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ask him about his ex-wife,&#34; his uncle suddenly says. I look at him to see him smirk. &#34;Ask him when she actually died,&#34; I frown and look at Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sign the goddamn papers,&#34; Logan snaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ask him what he did to one of Carls ex-boyfriends,&#34; he says casually as he reaches for the papers for him to sign. He starts to sign each document where there&#39;s a sticker that says &#39;sign here,&#39; &#34;I&#39;ll save you from asking him, he beat him to death, killed him, didn&#39;t even get anyone to do it for him, did it with his own hands,&#34; he explains as he signs. He pushes the papers towards Logan. Logan takes them and then flips through them. He looks at David and David nods before walking to the door and opening it to reveal Caroline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought about saving your marriage,&#34; Logan states getting his uncle&#39;s attention. &#34;But then you walked in with Erin and I thought why bother giving him 18months to sort out his marriage,&#34; he adds as he pulls out two pieces of paper and hands them to Caroline. &#34;Congratulations you&#39;re officially divorced,&#34; he states. My jaw drops, I look at his uncle to see his face twist in anger. &#34;Good news you&#39;ll still be getting the 10 million but you just signed 80% over to Caroline, along with everything else,&#34; Logan states and then gives him a small smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caroline walks over to us and takes the papers Logan is offering her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; she states and kisses each of his cheeks before turning to give her estranged husband a dark glare and then walking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t do this,&#34; His uncle says getting up and glaring at Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can and I have,&#34; Logan answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t run a company in another country,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can if I&#39;m expanding the company, now you need to leave,&#34; he glances at David. David moves towards, his uncle and takes him by his arm. &#34;Enjoy the rest of your night,&#34; Logan adds as David drags his uncle out of the room. Leaving just Logan and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan sits down opposite me and places his feet on the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When we get back to America I&#39;ll set up the transfer of everything, I know we&#39;ve not fully discussed you-&#34; I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you seriously not going to address what&#39;s just happened?&#34; I ask. &#34;What he&#39;s just said to me?&#34; I add.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you asking me if I&#39;ve ever killed someone?&#34; he asks and tilts his head at me. I nod in response and I feel bad to even show his uncles comments any attention but I can&#39;t help it. &#34;So that means you think I&#39;m capable of killing someone,&#34; he states. My eyes widen I open my mouth to tell him that&#39;s not true when he stops me, &#34;It&#39;s ok, the truth is I am capable of murder but I&#39;ve never done it. The person my uncle was talking about is dead but not by me, he died a year after my altercation with him, he got mixed up with something in Mexico,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do to him?&#34; I ask.</p>
