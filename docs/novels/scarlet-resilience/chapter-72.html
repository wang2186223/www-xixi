                <p>&#34;Ok I&#39;m just going to say this. You&#39;re Megan&#39;s friend and well it&#39;s just going to be hard on her if I don&#39;t try to get on with you. I don&#39;t have to like you which is so good,&#34; I smirk and shake my head this was probably the worst apology I have heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Told you he&#39;s rubbish at them unless it&#39;s to someone he cares about that he&#39;s hurt,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So yeah I&#39;m sorry about the arm just don&#39;t do it again because I am not saying this again to you,&#34; he pauses &#34;and don&#39;t tell anyone I said sorry to you,&#34; I stifle a giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm ok I accept it I think,&#34; Brendan said slowly obviously confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You better,&#34; Logan said and I try my hardest not to laugh. I look at the doorway to see Logan stood looking at me. I give him a small wave and point to Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His idea,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Carl said &#34;it was my idea to have a threesome yes but...what? Poppet please don&#39;t confuse me like this,&#34; he says. Logan walks towards me and moves his arms around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl, go out and get laid please,&#34; Logan said as he hugs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would but I&#39;m studying now and it&#39;s a distraction,&#34; he pauses &#34;but I guess I could, I&#39;d ask you to join me but,&#34; I turn and glare at him &#34;I&#39;m kidding, I&#39;ll ask Brendan he seems like a strapping young lad that would satisfy my needs,&#34; he said and walks off into the kitchen. I laugh a little and look up at Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems he has moved on from you. What are you going to do?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s saddening really I don&#39;t know what to do after I bought this house with him and everything and Max our child I will have to fight him for custody,&#34; he said and I roll my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pull back from the hug and start to walk up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going out,&#34; Carl chimes as he flamboyantly skips from the kitchen and up the stairs. &#34;I shall go and make myself look B-E-A-U-tiful,&#34; he said and I look at Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has he been taking my antidepressants?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I honestly have no idea about him anymore,&#34; he said &#34;I need to go let my dog back in the house be prepared for him diving on you,&#34; he said looking at me and then walks off. I look at Brendan to see him stand at the bottom of the stairs flicking through his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll talk to Melanie for you when I get home as I&#39;m guessing she&#39;s gone home,&#34; he states and I nod. He looks at me and walks up the steps to me. &#34;I might not be able to see you as much after today,&#34; he states. I frown and he looks down sighing a little &#34;I just might be going away for a while,&#34; I nod knowing he didn&#39;t want to go into it with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you better come back so we can go out drinking and getting soaked in the rain,&#34; I said and he smiles at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you better watch yourself with Carl,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will, I&#39;m a little scared to go out with him,&#34; he pauses &#34;are you sure he&#39;s not on anything,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure he&#39;s always like this, you should see him on a morning with Logan he feels him up and everything it&#39;s hilarious because Logan&#39;s just got up so he hasn&#39;t got the energy to fight him off,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then out of nowhere Max runs in and jumps up at me. I drop onto the step and start to rub the back of his ears with my fingers and then scratching up and down his neck. Logan then walks towards us and stands in front of us. Brendan looks at him and then at me. I give him a small smile and carry on petting Max.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The dog gets more attention than me sometimes,&#34; Logan states and steps up the steps. &#34;And you&#39;re going out tonight with Carl, you might live to regret that,&#34; he said looking at Brendan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I&#39;m sort of wishing I said no to him now but I need a good night,&#34; Brendan says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to get laid is what you&#39;re trying to say,&#34; Logan said with a small smirk and Brendan chuckles at himself &#34;Going out with Carl will you get that, that is if he takes you to the places he used to take me,&#34; Logan states and I look at him &#34;I don&#39;t miss any of that at all though,&#34; he said looking down at me with a smile and I laugh a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carl walks down the stairs and stands in front of me. He&#39;s wearing a dark green t-shirt that goes well with his skin tone and brings out his brown eyes. He teamed it with dark jeans that hung low and a pair of DC&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you checking me out?&#34; he asks looking at me. &#34;I can&#39;t really blame you though I am magnificently hot,&#34; he said smirking and leans towards me &#34;can I have a kiss goodbye?&#34; he asks and pouts at me giving me puppy eyes &#34;pwease?&#34; he said and I chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you cannot,&#34; Logan said pushing him away from me &#34;now go Brendan is waiting,&#34; he snaps causing Brendan and Carl to laugh at him. I smile and watch them walk to the door. &#34;Don&#39;t wait up for me honey,&#34; Carl said &#34;but do be ready for me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to kill you one day,&#34; Logan says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was talking to Megan,&#34; he states and I laugh &#34;but you can if you like,&#34; he said grinning at him. Logan walks down the steps &#34;I&#39;m sorry, please don&#39;t hurt me,&#34; he said running out of the house. &#34;I love you,&#34; he said innocently. Logan just walks to the door and watches Brendan walk out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I definitely regret my decision now,&#34; Brendan said to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t trust me,&#34; Logan said and shuts the door as Brendan walks out. I stand and walk up to my room with Max following. &#34;I guess I&#39;ll bring Max his food up then,&#34; he says. I look at him and give him a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well he needs feeding,&#34; I said and walk to my room with max.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sit on my bed and pat it letting Max jump on sprawl himself out across my bed, mostly on Logan&#39;s side. My lay back and pet him as we wait for Logan.  He walks into my room holding Max&#39;s dog bowl that had his name on it. Max jumps up and runs at him. Logan looks down at him and Max stops and sits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good boy,&#34; he said and places his food next to my dresser. &#34;Can I have some attention now?&#34; he asks me. I nod and he climbs onto my bed and sits next to me. I lay my head on his chest and play with his collar. He kisses the top of my head and wraps his arms around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know the more you frown the earlier you&#39;ll get wrinkles,&#34; I said moving up and stroking the small crease on his forehead &#34;you&#39;ll look fifty by the time you&#39;re 25,&#34; I state and he looks at me &#34;you frown and worry way too much,&#34; I said and caress his stubble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ll try and stop with the frowning,&#34; he states and leans in to kiss me. I smile and let him move on top of me. I pull back and he kisses my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And thank you for today, I&#39;m happy that you&#39;re going to try and get on with Brendan and that you said sorry to him, even if it was the worst apology I have ever heard,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, I do try,&#34; he said now looking at me. I smile and he leans in and kisses me softly. He moves his hand up my skirt stopping at the hem of my panties. My hands run through his hair feeling every soft strand that my fingers came in contact with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan pulls away from me and kisses down over my jaw line down to my neck. He pulls fully back and I sit up and kiss him. Yes I&#39;m feeling very confident at the moment with him. I have no idea why but right now I want to go all the way with him. It may be that over the past few hours I had seen a side of him I hadn&#39;t seen in a while or that I&#39;ve never felt as comfortable as I feel with him right now or that he is trying his hardest to prove just how sorry he is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling on his shirt he pulls back and takes it off revealing that muscled body he works on pretty much every week. He lays me back and kisses my neck and holds me at my waist. His kisses move up my neck over my jaw to my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then out of nowhere a loud bark erupts into the room. Logan pulls away and looks to see Max growling at him. Logan laughs and starts to kiss me but Max barks interrupting us again. I giggle and lay back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut it you,&#34; Logan said and leans in to kiss me and Max does it again and starts growling at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we should stop,&#34; I said and he groans and lays his head on my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate you. I&#39;m going to take you to the vet in the morning,&#34; he snaps at Max and Max lays down &#34;yeah how do you like me now,&#34; he snaps. I laugh and move my hand through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s just being protective of me,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does he think I&#39;m going to do? Eat you?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe, you don&#39;t know what goes on in his mind,&#34; I state, looking at him. I pat my bed and he jumps up, gets comfy and lays down on Logan&#39;s side. I laugh and Logan gets up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the? Down,&#34; he snaps and Max licks my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aww,&#34; I coo</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stupid dog,&#34; Logan huffs and holds me tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laugh and move my hand around his neck and kiss him. He moves off me and drops to the side of me and wraps his arms around my waist. He pulls back from the kiss and kisses my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s mine so back off,&#34; he snaps at the dog. I laugh &#34;see you&#39;re so beautiful I have to fight with my dog over you,&#34; I smile and get comfy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We lay talking for hours about anything and everything. It felt so good just to be able to lay with him and not have any drama going on just me and him talking. Even with Max laying at the side of us asleep and letting off ridiculously horrible smelling gasses. Yes we would share little innocent kisses but that&#39;s what made it feel even better because there was no pressure.  We did however finally fall asleep and I&#39;ve never had such a good sleep in a long time.</p>
