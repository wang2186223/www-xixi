                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke to someone moving hair out of my face. My eyes opened, and I came face to face with Logan&#39;s crystal sky blue eyes. He gave me a small smile, which caused me to look at his lips. I cleared my throat and turned so I was lying on my back. &#34;Morning,&#34; I said, still looking at the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Afternoon, you mean,&#34; he says. I frowned and looked at the clock to see it read 13:45. I raised my eyebrows a little and looked at Logan. &#34;Where have you been?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In bed, as you can see,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean, where did you go on Sunday night?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went out with a friend,&#34; I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All night?&#34; I nodded. &#34; Good job I didn&#39;t go to pick you up then, isn&#39;t it?&#34; he said to himself. I frowned at him. &#34;I had forgotten to pick you up from your granddad,&#34; he said. &#34;Good job you&#39;re okay, though,&#34; he said and sat up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I feel wanted,&#34; I said to myself as I got out of my bed. He looked at me and frowned. I rolled my eyes and walked out of my room slamming the door behind me and walked down to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once in the kitchen I see Carl putting some food out for Max. He looked at me and smiled a little. I sighed and walked to my laptop that was on the side. I switched it on and waited for it to load. &#34;Are you ok?&#34; he asks. I nodded &#34;Did Logan do something?&#34; he asked. I shook my head &#34;Do you want anything to eat?&#34; I shook my head in response &#34;is Logan up?&#34; I nodded &#34;Are you going to talk at all today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long are you staying here for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It speaks,&#34; he said in a fake shocking mock tone. I smiled a little &#34;Did I just get a smile out of you?&#34; he asked, moving over to me. I turned my head away from him so he couldn&#39;t see my face. &#34;I did,&#34; he said happily with himself and then he moved his arms around me and I frowned confused. &#34;You look like you need a hug,&#34; he said hugging me &#34;you looked like you needed a hug last night, too to be honest with you,&#34; hesaid and rubbed my shoulders &#34;I&#39;m not going to let go till you hug me back,&#34; he says. I sigh and slowly moved my arms around him. &#34;Now doesn&#39;t that feel wonderful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sound like one of those people that go round hugging random people going may peace be with you and love the earth and shit,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For all you know I could be one of those people,&#34; he says. I looked at him &#34;I&#39;m not but I could have been,&#34; he says. I sigh and hugged him properly. He smiled to himself &#34;I was right, you needed a hug,&#34; he said and kept hugging me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a minute or so I pulled back from the hug and started to type my password into my laptop. &#34;And to answer your question, I&#39;m not leaving for a while as if I left I&#39;d have nowhere to go,&#34; he states. I looked at him &#34;I got kicked out for not paying rent and well although I do have money it&#39;s money I can&#39;t get my hand on because I haven&#39;t done the requirements to get it,&#34; he said and then walked towards the fridge &#34;now do you want something to eat?&#34; he asks again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; I said while watching my laptop load.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is an omelette ok?&#34; he asks. I nodded and started to click onto my IM.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you and Logan go on Sunday?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a place for a friend,&#34; he said as he whisked eggs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not going to tell me either. Ok then, I just won&#39;t tell you both where I&#39;ve been since Sunday night,&#34; I shrugged and looked at him. He rolled his eyes and continued whisking the eggs. Then Logan walked into the kitchen. He walked straight to the kitchen table and took an apple from the fruit bowl and turned on his heels while biting into the apple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; Carl asked as Logan had trainers on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To the gym that a problem?&#34; he asks. Carl shook his head &#34;Good,&#34; he said and walked out of the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a minute or so we heard the front door slam shut. &#34;Fuck me have you both woke up on the wrong side today?&#34; he asks me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, I&#39;m not in any mood and well he obviously has a hedgehog stuck up his arse,&#34; I state. He laughed at me and made my omelette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want bacon with it or anything else? I forgot to ask you,&#34; I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A plain omelette is fine,&#34; I state and carried on looking at my laptop. After so many minutes he placed the plate with the omelette on in front of me. I gave him a small smile as I clicked on my internet browser. &#34;Have I done something to upset Logan at all?&#34; I ask  Carl as I moved my laptop out of the way and placed the plate in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not what I know of why?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just Sunday I phoned him because I really needed to talk to him and he declined both of my calls, yesterday he seemed different with me for some reason and today well today he just seems pissed off,&#34; I said looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighs and stood from the chair he was sitting on &#34; he has a lot on his mind at the moment that&#39;s all, give him a few days and he&#39;ll be fine,&#34; he said and walked out of the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he on his man period?&#34; I called. I heard him laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah something like that,&#34; he called back. I smiled a little and started to eat my breakfast. After about twenty minutes I walked into the living room with my laptop and sat down on the sofa. Carl looked at me and watched me as I placed my laptop on the coffee table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you eat it all?&#34; he asks. I looked at him and slowly shook my head. He did the Logan thing and sighs while running his hand through his hair. &#34;Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was full, I ate most of it and you can go look if you don&#39;t believe me, I have left the plate on the side so you know,&#34; I said and clicked onto Brendan&#39;s name on my IM list. I sent him a quick &#39;Hey&#39; and then looked at Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know you may have to go back in hospital if you don&#39;t start eating, right?&#34; he asks. I sigh and looked back at my laptop screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes and I do eat I just eat little portions. You act like I have an eating disorder I don&#39;t I just know there is no point in me putting weight on when as soon as my father gets back out he will make me lose it all again,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do know right with what your dad has done it will be years before he gets anywhere near you,&#34; he says. I frowned and closed my laptop while standing up. He gave me a confused look and I picked up my laptop and started to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what you think, you know nothing,&#34; I snapped as I walked past him and out of the living room.</p>
