                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendan looked at me and smirked as he leaned towards me. I sigh and turn my head; he kisses my cheek and moves his arms around me. I looked at the time to see it was nearly one PM. Logan had rang me at eleven to wake me up and had decided to remind me of my session today. The truth was I was awake when he rang me as I had, had another nightmare. That was the reason Brendan was here now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing I&#39;m just thinking,&#34; I said and stood up &#34;I&#39;m going to make myself a drink,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do it,&#34; he said, smiling at me. I nodded and sat back down. I sigh and bring my knees to my chest and lay my head on my knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I heard Logan&#39;s voice said as he placed a hand on my head. I looked at him and smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, now,&#34; I said, &#34;I never heard you come in,&#34; I paused, &#34;what are you doing home early anyway?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve come to take you to your session,&#34;he says. I sigh and look away from him &#34;As I knew you were planning on not going to it,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendan&#39;s here,&#34; I said and I had to admit in a way it was to piss him off because I really did not want to go to the session after all it meant talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; he said and sat down next to me and looked around. He sighs and reaches for the bottle of vodka that was placed on the floor at the side of the table. &#34;Megan, I leave you for four and a half hours and you&#39;re already drinking,&#34;he says. I rolled my eyes and watched Brendan walk back into the room with a cup of coffee. He looked at Logan and frowned, obviously confused as to why he was back early and then continued to walk towards me with my coffee. &#34;I&#39;m guessing this was your doing,&#34; Logan said looking at him and shaking the bottle at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, she was drinking it when I got here, I&#39;ve had her on coffee since I&#39;ve been here,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what time did you get here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At about eleven, when you phoned,&#34; he says. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath ready for the evil look or lecture I was going to get off Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; he said and stood up, &#34;You know there&#39;s a name for people who drink as soon as they get up in the morning, Megan,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m very far from an alcoholic,&#34; I said and watched him walk off into the kitchen with the bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you don&#39;t mind if I pour it down the sink then?&#34; he asks. I sigh and clenched the mug in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I said and started to drink my coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I better go then,&#34; Brendan said and looked at me &#34;call me if you need me,&#34; he says. I nodded and felt his hand go into mine. He gave it a small squeeze and let go as he walked out. I heard the front door shut and then about a minute later his car started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan walked back into the room and then sat in front of me on the coffee table. He took the mug out of my hands and held my hands in his. &#34;Talk to me,&#34;he says. I glanced at him and then kept my eyes on our hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34;he says. I gulped and slowly started to cry. He sighed and sat next to me and hugged me. I hugged him back and moved on top of him &#34;I have something to tell you,&#34;he says. I pulled away and looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie will be doing four weeks of Saturday detentions,&#34;he states. My eyes widened &#34;She punched Courtney in the face and broke her nose,&#34; I chuckled a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s wanted to do that for a while,&#34; I said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm, she did it because Courtney called you a lucky bitch after finding out you were living with me,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is that lucky? You throw my alcohol down the sink that is not lucky,&#34; I said and looked at him to see him frown at me. I smiled a little and wiped my cheeks. He kissed me on the cheek and then held my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why was Brendan here?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We didn&#39;t do anything,&#34; I said looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never asked that,&#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But we didn&#39;t, he tried to kiss me but I gave him the cheek,&#34; I say. He then sighs and looks down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I ask you something and you won&#39;t get angry or upset?&#34; he asks. I nodded &#34;have you and him ever slept with each other?&#34; he asked. I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No and never will, I cheated on Tyler with him though,&#34; and as I said that his face sort of dropped &#34;I shouldn&#39;t have told you that,&#34; I said to myself &#34;What happened was Tyler had cheated on me and we had this argument over something else because I didn&#39;t want him to know that I knew, so we had an argument at this party and then he walked out leaving me on my own. And Brendan was there and I don&#39;t really need to go into details do I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he says. I chuckled and looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We didn&#39;t have sex,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because that makes me feel so much better,&#34; he says. I sigh &#34;What about Tyler did you and him ever have sex?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, we were going to but then that night was the night I had found out my mother had died and then we were going to again but my father came home,&#34; I said and looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So technically you&#39;re still a virgin?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Logan, I&#39;m not and no matter what way you look at it I&#39;m not. Benjamin took my virginity and well I can&#39;t change that,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No buts do you not think I wish I was?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do, but,&#34; he sighs, unable to finish that sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m off to get ready,&#34; I said and got off him and walked out of the room to my room. I knew he was just trying to make me feel better but he wasn&#39;t. He was making me feel worse. I changed into a pair of black joggers and a white vest top with my jumper to match and walked down stairs to the living room. Logan stood with his trousers down. &#34;What are you doing?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My stitches really itch. I&#39;m going to change my bottoms,&#34; he said, taking them fully off and then walking past me and out of the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were doing something else,&#34; I said to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard that,&#34;he says. I smiled a little and started to brush my hair in the mirror. After a few minutes he walked into the room now wearing a pair of jeans and wrapped his arms around my waist.  &#34;It was pretty funny you know,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When Melanie punched Courtney,&#34; he states. I smiled and started to plait my hair to the side. He lays his head on my shoulder and yawns. &#34;I&#39;m shattered,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should have gone to bed earlier,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had tests to prepare,&#34;he says. I looked at him as I tied the hair band at the end of my plait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My hair needs cutting,&#34; I said and looked at him. He hummed and moved his arms around my arms, hugging me tightly. &#34;C&#39;mon then you said you were taking me to my psychiatrist session not holding me hostage in front of a mirror,&#34; I said tapping his arms with my hand. He groaned and pulled away. &#34;You&#39;re such a child sometimes,&#34; I said and walked out of the room to pick up my converse and sat on the steps to put them on. He walked out of the room with his car keys and folded his arms while looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you been smoking?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had two, maybe three cigarettes,&#34; he sighs. &#34;It&#39;s not like I committed a murder Logan, lighten up,&#34; I said and stood up once I had my converse. &#34;I don&#39;t smoke that much only every now and then,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you&#39;re with Brendan?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes mostly but,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems you do a lot with Brendan,&#34; he said walking out of the Mansion &#34;you drink with Brendan and you take drugs with Brendan, you cheat on boyfriends with Brendan. I can really see how much he cares about you,&#34;he said as he walked to his car. I sigh and shut the front door and walk behind him to the car.</p>
