                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan lifts me to move me further up the bed and then lays me down. He pulls back and sits back on his heels as he pulls his shirt over his head. I let out a low, slow breath as I watched his muscles move at the action. Just looking at him does me in. Every inch of him is delicious. How this man can think I&#39;d want anyone else is beyond me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting up, I reach for him, trailing my fingers down his abdomen, to his hands that are unbuckling his belt. He lets go and allows me. I look up at him, and his crystal blue eyes watch me as I lower the zip of his jeans. I stop and move up onto my knees, so I&#39;m eye-level with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is the door locked this time, because it seems every time we get interrupted,&#34; I kiss up to his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We do, don&#39;t we,&#34; he states and moves his hands to my hips and round to my bum. His fingers move under the strap of my thong. &#34;I don&#39;t care enough to let go of you and go lock the door,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me neither,&#34; I reply in his ear and nibble a little. He grins and squeezes my bum, pressing my body to his. Moving my hands back down to his jeans, I push them down. He pulls back and pulls his jeans and boxers entirely off, leaving him naked and hard in front of me. He comes back to me and wraps his arms around my waist. His hands move, one to my bra strap the other to my thigh, pulling me up, so his hard length rubs against my clit. I moan into the kiss and feel him unhook my bra with his other hand. &#34;Logan,&#34; I whisper as he kisses down my neck, leaving a mark. I know he does this on purpose to make sure people know I&#39;m with someone and it turns me on even more. To know he is this possessive over me. He lays me back down and takes my bra off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling away from me I look at him in disappointment, and he smirks before moving his hands to my thong and pulls the straps down, I lift my hips and watch as his eyes fill with lust as he looks at my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck I love how wet you get,&#34; he groans as he moves his fingers to my sex. I moan as one digit enters me. I close my eyes as a shiver runs down my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I moan as I feel his mouth on me. I look down and watch him kiss up my thigh to my sex. His tongue licks over my clit to my entrance and back. Tilting my head back, I move my hand through his hair as his sinful mouth works wonders on my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving my leg up, I rest my foot on his back as my orgasm builds, my whole body coils in pleasure, my toes curl, and I can&#39;t help but thrust my hips toward his mouth. I place my hand over my mouth to stifle my moans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan pulls back just as I reach the edge, and looks down at me. His fingers move in and out of me, stroking the fire of my orgasm. I look at him to see him smirk at me before moving to rub his penis along my slit. Lifting my hips, I feel his length run over my clit. I moan and move my hands to his arms and pull him towards me. His lips press against mine, and I taste myself in the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; he groans as I grind my hips against his. Wrapping his arms around my waist, he lifts me, so I&#39;m sat straddling him, and slowly he enters me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan, I wanted,&#34; I don&#39;t finish my sentence as he moves my hips against him, making him go deeper inside me. I gasp and press my head against his shoulder as my orgasm washes over me. I wanted to pleasure him too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; he pants as he meets me thrust for thrust. I bury my head into his neck as I try to muffle my moans. His hands move through my hair, and he makes me look at him. I say his name before his lips press to mine. He slows our pace to long slow thrusts. &#34;You ok?&#34; he asks. I nod as talking doesn&#39;t seem possible right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear talking outside the door, and I have a feeling it&#39;s Brett, and at this moment in time, I don&#39;t care who hears us. I look at the door, and Logan kisses my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ignore them,&#34; he says in my ear and kisses my ear. I nod and move my hands down his body and back up to his neck. He lays us both back down changing our position and the angle of our bodies. His body presses against mine as he rocks into me. I move one of my legs up to his waist and push him into me with my foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feel of him is different. Tonight this feels more intense, and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the conversation we had or because it has been a little while since we have been together. I don&#39;t know how or why he is so insecure about us. No one possesses my mind like he does or makes me feel the way he does.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My orgasm builds at every long luxurious thrust of our hips, and I can&#39;t help but ask him to go faster. I feel myself dig my nails into his shoulder as I try my best to hold my moans in but with each powerful thrust, it becomes more challenging. I kiss his neck and then feel his other hand move between us to my clit, and his fingers strum my bundle of nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come for me baby,&#34; he pants, and I can hear he&#39;s just as close as me. I feel sweat beading all over my body, and my walls tighten around his cock. &#34;That&#39;s it,&#34; he thrusts hard into me and then again, and again, and I feel my orgasm wash over me. I scream my orgasm and try my best to muffle my sound in the crook of his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan, ah god Logan,&#34; I pant as I feel another start to build as he continues his hard thrusts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck,&#34; he groans &#34;you feel so god damn good,&#34; he says and moves my hair from my face to kiss me on the lips. I pull away as my body shiver with pleasure, making me moan loudly. I press my forehead against his before kissing him again. He pulls back and looks at me &#34;I love you,&#34; he confesses, and I feel the words on the tip of my tongue, shocking me. I stop myself from saying them back. He presses his lips to mine, and I feel his orgasm and mine follows as he continues his rhythm into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay looking at Logan. He&#39;s fast asleep. He fell asleep pretty quickly; I think it helped that he thought I was sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He told me he loves me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should be happy. Any girl would be delighted to know that their boyfriend loves them. I should be glad he said it and that he wasn&#39;t afraid to say it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I&#39;m not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could I have been so stupid? I don&#39;t want him to love me. I want him to wake up and take that back. What&#39;s worse is I nearly said it back. I can&#39;t risk that. I just can&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and move to get out of bed. I stand and feel my legs wobble a little. Just great, he&#39;s in love with me, and he can make me jelly legged after sex just what I need. I sit back down on the bed and look down at him sleeping. This wonderful man loves me, and I can&#39;t love him back. It&#39;s now I feel the tears rolling down my cheeks. I don&#39;t want to hurt him. The thought of breaking up with him physically hurts. But I have to. If I want to protect myself and my heart, I have to. I can&#39;t have another person use my love to hurt me. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll survive.</p>
