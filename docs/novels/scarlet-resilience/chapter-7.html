                <p>&#34;That&#39;s when he started hitting me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you tell him that if you knew he was going to hurt you?&#34; asked the blonde officer. My psychiatrist looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something snapped,&#34; she states &#34;didn&#39;t it Megan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded &#34;he said he was going to kill me if I ever told anyone or if I ever had sex with someone else other than him so I decided to tell him both to guarantee my death,&#34; I state &#34;I knew that once he had killed me he&#39;d have nothing to do and he&#39;d be suffering,&#34; I state. &#34;I taunted him throughout the beating and when he raped me telling him he wouldn&#39;t get what he wanted from me. I knew the more I taunted him the angrier he would get so I told him more and well I had a recording of me and Tyler and I made him listen but...&#34; they all looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what?&#34; Melanie asked as I was looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gulped and looked down at my lap &#34;but he stopped when he realised how much I hated him and he threatened to hurt one of my friends,&#34; I slowly started to cry more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which friend?&#34; the police officer asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly raised my hand and pointed to Melanie &#34;He said if I didn&#39;t communicate with him better he would pay her a visit,he says I was boring him and he wanted to try out a blonde,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do?&#34; Melanie asked. I looked at her to see her eyes slowly welling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told him not to go near you but he wouldn&#39;t listen so I consented to him,&#34; I cut off when I saw her cry more. I gulped and looked down at my lap. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I say quietly &#34;but I had to because if I didn&#39;t he would have hurt you and I didn&#39;t want him hurting you,&#34; Melanie wiped her tears and got off my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to go,&#34; she said quietly and walked out of the room faster than I could have said her name. I looked down at my lap crying harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what happened?&#34; asked the police officer. I let out a shaky breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well he just did what he always did and at one point used his gun on me,&#34; I say quietly. I heard the woman gasp &#34;and well I don&#39;t know what time it was but then Logan walked in and well I don&#39;t really remember that much,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was nearly passed out when I came,&#34; Logan stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; the police officer said and stood up &#34;ok thank you so much Megan I know that was hard for you to do,&#34; she says and walked out with her tape recorder. I looked at Logan to see him smile slightly at me and then look down at my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t want to,&#34; I say looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34;he says sitting on my bed taking my hands in his, &#34;you did it to save your friend,&#34;he says &#34;no one&#39;s going to judge you for that,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No buts if anyone has a problem with it they can answer to me now stop crying,&#34;he says wiping my cheeks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, we need to tell you something,&#34; my grandfather said. I looked at him &#34;I have found you somewhere to stay that isn&#39;t with me,&#34;he states &#34;Logan has offered to look after you until you are stable to be on your own,&#34;he states. My eyes widened slightly and I looked at Logan &#34;but you have to visit me every Sunday and you have to go see the psychiatrist every Wednesday,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I say quietly &#34;why do I have to see you?&#34; I ask, looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I want to be more involved in your life and well your uncle won&#39;t be very happy if I tell him I&#39;m having no contact with you,&#34;he states</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do we have a deal?&#34; he asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I say, laying my head back and yawning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When was the last time you slept?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; I say lying back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighs and moves on to something else &#34;I have arranged for a nurse to visit you everyday to change the bandages and to observe you and see how you are doing physically,&#34;he states. &#34;And she will do that until you are well,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I say quietly. There was no point in me arguing with him when I didn&#39;t have the energy to and he would most likely win anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We slowly walked into the house I&#39;d now be staying in with Logan. It wasn&#39;t exactly small to say only two people were staying in it. It had four bedrooms and three on sweets, a games room and a study and that was only upstairs, downstairs there was a giant kitchen and living room, a dining room, a gym and an indoor swimming pool. In the garden was another swimming pool, a pool house a tennis court and a Jacuzzi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked up the giant staircase and turned towards my bedroom. I had been here before when I was five and my grandparents lived here for about a year while they refurbished their mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan where are you going?&#34; asked my grandfather. I ignored him and went straight to my room. I opened it to see it had been painted a different colour to what it was last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wall with the window and balcony was painted a dark purple and the other three walls were a magnolia colour. The windows were framed with cream colour curtains that had dark purple swirl design on the bottom that faded the higher the swirls went. A king size bed was placed in the middle of the room facing me, a dressing table at the right between the walk-in wardrobe door and the bathroom door. I then saw my old piano at the left with the violin stand next to it. The carpet was a dark purple colour matching the wall to the north.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly walked to my piano and sat down on the stool while looking at the black panel that covered the keys. Gliding my hands over it I lifted it up to reveal the off white shiny keys. I lightly skimmed my fingers across each one and let out a small sigh while looking down at them as old memories of playing this with my mother stood at the side of me filled my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t play anymore do you?&#34; I heard someone say. I turned to see my Grandfather standing at the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I simply said and stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You played beautifully if I remember correctly,&#34;he states. I didn&#39;t say anything in return, I just shut the cover &#34;You stopped when your mom died, you should play again,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I shouldn&#39;t and I want you to get rid of it,&#34; I snapped and walked into the bathroom slamming the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran my hand through my hair and slid down the door to the cold dark grey granite tiled floor. I pulled my knees to my chest and laid my head on them and slowly and silently started crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked off to the living room; I only visited this house yesterday so I knew where most things were. I sat and rubbed my leg, it killed but I was restricted to two pills a day and the first barely got me through the morning. I didn&#39;t really bother going after Megan, she obviously wanted to be on her own and well people just had to be patient with her. She may seem ok one moment and will be crying silently the next. She didn&#39;t like crying but I had told her it was ok to cry. I&#39;d probably would have committed suicide by now but she&#39;s stronger than me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s locked herself in the bathroom,&#34; I heard Carlton say. I shrugged and lent my head back &#34;Do you not care?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes but have you ever thought she just might want to be on her own,&#34; I state while looking at the powerful looking man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; he sighs &#34;but what if she&#39;s in there forever?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;ll come out when she&#39;s ready,&#34; I state. &#34;There&#39;s nothing in there she can hurt herself with, so she&#39;ll most likely get a shower and then get dressed and come downstairs once she feels comfortable.&#34; I stated and stood up &#34;did you go food shopping before we moved in?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good I&#39;m starving,&#34; I say and walked into the kitchen to make myself something to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few hours had passed and I was lying on the couch watching a movie. Megan hadn&#39;t come downstairs yet. I had heard the shower run and it ran for about 2 hours and then it turned off and that was around half an hour ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the door opening slowly and then closing made me open my eyes. I sigh and close my eyes again. After so many seconds I didn&#39;t hear anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; she says quietly. I opened my eyes to see her face all red from crying and her eyes were just bloodshot now. I slowly sat up looking at her. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to,&#34; she says quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t mean to what?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled her jumper off her to reveal her skin red almost blood red. I moved my hand to hers but she moved her hand away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wanted to stop feeling his hands on me and it wouldn&#39;t go,&#34; she says crying. I sigh and looked at her. She had scrubbed her skin with one of the washing appliances until her skin bled it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll phone the nurse,&#34; I said and got up to get the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re angry,&#34; she states. I sigh and dial the number for the nurse. &#34;I understand,&#34; she says quietly. I sigh and look away from her. I wasn&#39;t angry I was more upset for her and well unlike some people I didn&#39;t show it much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not angry,&#34; I state and listened to the phone ring. &#34;Hey,&#34; I say quietly down the phone &#34;I need you to come by as soon as possible,&#34; I say to the nurse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happened?&#34; The nurse asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s hurt herself,&#34; I say quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok I&#39;ll be there as soon as I can,&#34; the nurse stated and hung up. I turned and put the phone down while looking at Megan. She had her jumper back on and she was fiddling with her fingers while crying. I took a deep breath and sat on the coffee table while facing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I say quietly. She looked at me still crying &#34;It&#39;s ok I&#39;m far from angry with you,&#34; I state. She looked down at her lap and let out a loud sob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t do this,&#34; she cried &#34;I...&#34; she didn&#39;t finish what she was about to say she just cried harder. &#34;Every bit of me hurts,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I say quietly and slowly took her hands &#34;and if I could make it all stop hurting Megan I would, but I can&#39;t and I&#39;m sorry for that,&#34; I say &#34;All I can do is be here for you and I actually feel useless at the moment,&#34; she looked at me as I say that, I moved next to her on the couch looking at her. &#34;I know it may seem like forever away at the moment but everything will be better,&#34; I say with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan slowly looked away from me and looked at the television &#34;You were asleep when I came down,&#34; she says changing the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t, I was resting my eyes,&#34; I state.</p>
