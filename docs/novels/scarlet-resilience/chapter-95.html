                <p>\*\*Megan\*\*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is the furthest we&#39;ve gone, I&#39;m pretty much naked under him and I don&#39;t feel as nervous as I thought I would. I have to admit I&#39;ve felt more comfortable with him touching me since we got here. I know it won&#39;t always be like this though. I know there are going to be times where I can&#39;t stand his touch but right now I&#39;m enjoying the feeling of his body against mine even though I&#39;d rather be on top right now. And as if he read my mind he hugs my body to his and moves onto his back so that I&#39;m on top. He moves onto his elbows and sits up. I pull back and run a hand through my hair moving it out of my face. He presses his lips softly on my collar bone and moves his hands up my sides. He stops at my rib cage and moves his finger along the strap of my bikini top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wince moving abruptly away from him when his fingers touch the cuts on my left side. He looks at my side, he sighs a little and strokes them as gently as he can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; he says and then kisses me on the lips. This kiss is passionate. I can feel his upset and anger in this kiss and I don&#39;t like it. His hand fists at the back of my neck gripping my hair and pushing me hard to him. I move my hands to his chest and push him away from me and down onto the bed firmly holding him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t do that,&#34; I say, looking him in the eyes. His usually bright blue eyes are dark and angry. &#34;You&#39;re angry,&#34; I state. He eases up onto his forearms and closes his eyes while taking a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t you be?&#34; he asks and opens his eyes. He moves one hand on to my hand and moves my hand to his lips. &#34;I can&#39;t help but be angry,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I say taking my hand out of his and fold my arms over my stomach. He sits up puts his hands on my hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? I&#39;m not angry at you,&#34; he says stroking my hair and looking me in the eyes &#34;I&#39;m angry with myself,&#34; I frown and look at him &#34;I promised to protect you and I didn&#39;t, I allowed - he touches my nose and my cheek bone that is bruised - this to happen,&#34; he pauses and moves his hand to my rib &#34;which led to this,&#34; he says gently stroking my cuts. &#34;I will never allow it to happen again,&#34; he says and hugs me. &#34;That&#39;s what I&#39;m angry about, my inability to hold promises,&#34; he says and holds me tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so harsh on yourself,&#34; I say and kiss his cheek. He presses me to his body and inhales.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You smell really nice,&#34; he says and I giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Again my boyfriends body wash,&#34; I say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bet your boyfriend always smells nice,&#34; he says and I giggle and make him face me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Correct you do,&#34; I say and kiss him on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel his hands move to my back and pull on the string around my neck from my bikini. My bikini top doesn&#39;t fall but I feel it slipping a little. His hands move around to the front of my body one moving up my neck and around the nape of my neck. I feel his other hand move across my chest as if testing if I&#39;m ok with where he&#39;s going with this. His hand moves over my breast and gently squeezes me. I smile at the slyness of move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; he says against my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so smooth,&#34; I say with slight giggle and then I hear the slight turn of a handle. I pull away from him and turn to see his uncle walk in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long do you intend to...&#34; he trails off as he look at us. I move my hands to my neck and tie my bikini straps. &#34;Holy...&#34; he starts as I get up off Logan. Logan moves his hands around my waist. I move his hands away from me and reach for my dress. I grab it and walk off into the bathroom. &#34;Is she ok?&#34; I hear his uncle ask &#34;Is that what her dad did?&#34; he asks him. I sigh deeply and put on my dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to leave,&#34; Logan says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well hurry the hell up I&#39;ve been waiting for ages, get yourself dressed and get downstairs,&#34; he says</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; he says &#34;now get out,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Man her father must be fucked up, I did some reading about him too,&#34; he says and Logan cuts him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out,&#34; he yells. I hear the door shut and I slowly open the bathroom door to see Logan stood at the end of the bed. &#34;Self-centred ass,&#34; Logan says and then looks at me. &#34;Are you ok?&#34; he asks &#34;I know you heard him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ok,&#34; I say standing in front of him. He moves his hands around my waist and kisses me on the lips. &#34;Are you?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I need to go to the toilet,&#34; he says and kisses me again and then takes his hands from around me to walk off into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like some help?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I&#39;m ok, I have my hand, it&#39;s become my best friend believe it or not,&#34; he says &#34;go join your friends because I also need to get ready for my meetings,&#34; he says. I nod and kiss him on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make sure you&#39;ve got your phone so you can look at porn,&#34; I say and he chuckles. I reach for his phone which is on the dresser and hand it to him. &#34;No blondes,&#34; I say and he smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t dream of it,&#34; he says and I walk away from him and out of the bedroom door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\*\*Logan\*\*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Climbing into the limousine I straighten my tie and look at my uncle to see him on his blackberry. He glances at me and then reaches into his blazer inside pocket and pulls a phone out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s for you for business only and I think you need to re-evaluate your decision to stay with that girl,&#34; he says as he holds the phone out to me. I take it to see it&#39;s a blackberry. I screw my nose at it and sigh. &#34;Yes Blackberry&#39;s are quite bad for internet and not exactly the best phones on the market but they&#39;re good for business,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok and what you said in there was out of order,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What you&#39;re doing is out of order, that girl has been through hell and do you really think you&#39;re the best person for her?&#34; he asks. I frown at him &#34;Logan you&#39;re not the nicest of people and with the fact you only came out of rehab last year means you&#39;re in no position to have a serious relationship. That girl needs help not a boyfriend that can&#39;t keep it in his pants and may or may not go off the rails at any given moment,&#34; he explains. I sigh and look out of the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we going?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Manchester, does she know about your violent history?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A little,&#34; I mumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A little,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t exactly go into detail with her, I just told her that I&#39;m not proud of some of the things I&#39;ve done,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well all I&#39;m saying is think about you and her do you really think you&#39;re good for her at this moment in her life and yours?&#34; he asks and I sigh &#34;and I&#39;m telling you this as your uncle not as your business partner, so think about it,&#34; he says and I nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know he&#39;s right, that I should think about it because I do have quite a bad history with people, women, drugs and violence the extent of my violence is worse than her fathers. Some of the things my psychologist doesn&#39;t fully know, only I and Carl and the people that were involved know about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I break up with her, I&#39;ll hurt her,&#34; I say quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t it be the best to do it now rather than later on when she&#39;s too deep into the relationship?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I guess,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just think about it more, you may see you and her having a future but does she? I mean looking at her psychologist&#39;s notes she saw herself dying by the end of last year. She didn&#39;t plan to be alive now and with her frame of mine one thing could just send her over,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know this?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Money Logan, I hired someone to get all the notes and send me a copy,&#34; he explains. I sigh &#34;I have to look into every detail about her Logan,&#34; I remain silent and rest my chin on my hand after a few minutes a thought comes into my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What you said in the bedroom you said on purpose,&#34; I say now looking at him. He frowns &#34;if you&#39;ve read her records you would know what her father has done and know how much her body affects her,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t gotten that far,&#34; he says &#34;I read the first meeting she had with her psychologist, tell her that I am sorry for what I said,&#34; he pauses &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to cause her any upset,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell her when I get a chance to call her,&#34; I say and turn my head out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me draft you about the meetings we&#39;re having,&#34; he says and starts to brief me.</p>
