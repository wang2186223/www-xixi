                <p>I had been in the gym since me and Megan had gotten back home. She was completely silent in the car and she didn&#39;t say anything when we got home. I had gotten changed and came straight to the gym room. Working out let me let off some steam, I hadn&#39;t worked out for a while due to been in the hospital most of the time. I know I didn&#39;t tell her everything today but I could only tell her what I allowed myself to tell her. I didn&#39;t want to lie to her about Stephanie but it felt the safest option when I looked at her. Although I hate to admit I am hiding from her right now because I know I won&#39;t see her here unless she needs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing up the barbell for the seventeenth time I heard the door open.  I pulled the bar down just above my chest and pushed up once more and moved it onto the hooks and then sat up to see Megan standing looking at me. I sigh and laid back down picking up the weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it ok if I go out?&#34; she asked me as I moved the weight down to my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want to,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok urm I may not be back tonight though,&#34; I frowned and put the weight back on the hook and sat up looking at her. &#34;I&#39;m off with Brendan, apparently one of his friends is having a party,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said and stood while picking up the sweat towel at the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t want me to go I won&#39;t go,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t really have any said in the matter,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do, you&#39;re my guardian so you can say yes or no,&#34; she explained. I sigh and look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to go?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; she said, &#34;I am dressed for it,&#34; she said, unbuttoning her long coat and showing me what she was wearing, which was a pair of black skinnies and a rock t-shirt. She paused &#34;although I think I may have to change depending on where the party is at,&#34; she said as if she was thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can, just be back by 12 if you&#39;re not then I&#39;ll come and get you myself so leave me the address of the house where the party is being held,&#34; I state. She huffed a little and turned on her heels and walked out muttering something under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes and walked out after her to see Brendan standing waiting for her in the foyer. I stood by the stairs watching her get the details off him and then walk over to me with the piece of paper. My eyes widened as I looked at the address. I knew this address all too well as I did buy the house myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that ok, can I go now?&#34; she asks. I nodded and put the piece of paper in my pocket while walking with her to the door. Brendan glared at me as I opened the front door for them. I watched him tell her to wait for him in the car and then turn to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know all about you,&#34; he said, moving his hands in his pockets. I frowned, confused to what he was saying about &#34;the man you used to be, I know everything and I also know about your wife and that she&#39;s only been dead a week,&#34; he states and pauses &#34;well pronounced dead,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve told Megan everything,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; he asks &#34;so if I casually brought up that your wife has only just passed she&#39;d know what I was talking about,&#34; I clenched my fists. &#34;And I wonder if she truly knows about your anger and you&#39;ve been sectioned and the countless crimes you&#39;ve done?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; I ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing all I want is for you to come clean about everything to the student you&#39;re in love with,&#34;he states and steps outside &#34;now smile and make it look like we&#39;re talking about something not so serious,&#34; I sigh and do what he says. &#34;There&#39;s nothing I can do really as bribing you to do things for me will only hurt Megan because there is a bribe I would love to do but I&#39;m not selfish,&#34;he says. &#34;All you need to do is tell her everything about yourself,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the time limit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Until I decide to tell her myself,&#34;he said smiling and turned and walked to his car, &#34;I&#39;m not very patient,&#34; he called loud enough for me to hear. I sigh and shut the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a douche,&#34; I heard Carl say. I sigh &#34;I would have well said to you to stop caring for her or something because you can tell he wants to do Megan in every direction he possibly can,&#34;he said casually. I turned to look at him. &#34;I mean c&#39;mon the weapon he has is pretty powerful,&#34;he said &#34;after all no one fully knows what happened the night with that man you &#39;nearly&#39; killed,&#34;he said as he walked up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t kill him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you just helped him onto his deathbed,&#34;he says. I sigh while shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re being melodramatic, he&#39;s not dead,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s paralyzed from the neck down, he can&#39;t do anything he was able to do before you got your hands on him so it&#39;s safe to said he may as well be dead,&#34; Carl said turning to look at me &#34;you do know he committed suicide last year right?&#34; he asks. I frowned &#34;he was having physio for a long time and well he tricked one of his mates at the time to wheel him to the roof of the hospital and asked them to leave him for a bit they stupidly did and he wheeled himself off and he fell to his death,&#34; he explained. I looked down &#34;so really you did kill him,&#34;he said and walked up the stairs to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rubbed my face and moved my hands through my hair. I then walked up the stairs to his room standing at the door way. &#34;Is he really dead?&#34; I ask . He sighs and looks at me &#34;did he really kill himself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled &#34;nah I&#39;m just fucking with you, bur he is dead, he was in a car accident,&#34; he paused and I frowned &#34;he wasn&#39;t really paralyzed from the neck down it was more from the waist down,&#34; I growled and clenched my fists as I walked into his room. He looked at me and then gulped &#34;&#34;it was just a joke, honest please don&#39;t hurt me I wuv yew,&#34;he says. I growled and went to hit him. He ducked and ran towards the doorway. &#34;I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d take it so seriously,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re fucking sick,&#34; I said and walked out after him. He ran to the other side of the stairs and I sigh and walk down the stairs &#34;don&#39;t talk to me,&#34; I snapped and walked down the stairs into the living room and into the kitchen.  After about two minutes of trying to calm down I felt a weight on my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34;he said, laying his head on my shoulder blade and then I felt his arms go round me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kiss me and I will kill you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jeez you act like you&#39;ve never kiss me before,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to find your own place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No because then I can&#39;t watch you go round half naked,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well carry on trying it on with me and I will personally kick you out myself,&#34; I said and moved his hands off me. &#34;You almost make me homophobic,&#34; I said and moved fully away from him. He sighs and yawns while leaning against the sink and folding his arms across his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what are you going to do?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to go buy another car, I&#39;m thinking of a Bentley,&#34; I said thinking it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to splash the cash now like before?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I need a Bentley, they&#39;ve got more room than my Porsche,&#34; I said and took a bottle of water from the fridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what are you going to do about that guy,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing I can do, the old me probably would have threatened him and may have beat him but I&#39;m not the old me so I will just have to do what he says,&#34; I said and looked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look like you could do with a massage,&#34; my eyes shot at him as those words left him. He rubbed his hands together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come anywhere near me and I will kill you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh darling I&#39;ll come inside you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it I now have a phobia of you, never mind gay men,&#34; I said and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t run from our love,&#34; he cried. I sigh and sit on the sofa. I knew he was only doing to keep my mind off what was stressing me out. I knew most of everything he said to me was a joke. Most of it.  He gave me a cheesy grin as he sat opposite me. I sigh and reach for my tobacco tin. &#34;You&#39;re not having weed are you?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a bit, why?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No reason,&#34; he said, laying down and covering his eyes. &#34;I&#39;m shattered,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Well go to sleep,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t have any weed,&#34; he suddenly said. I frowned as I held the lighter to the end of my roll up. &#34;You know you&#39;re gonna have to pick Megan up at that party and you don&#39;t need another DUI,&#34;he says. I sigh and take the roll up from my lips and place it and the lighter down on the coffee table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;m off back in the gym,&#34; I said, getting up and walking out of the room. I heard him sigh and mutter something under his breath.</p>
