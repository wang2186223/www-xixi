                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out of Yasmin&#39;s room I shut the door behind me and walk down the staircase towards the dining room. I open the door and look around to see Logan sat looking over some papers with Carl sat next to him. They look towards me and I smile a little, giving them a small wave as I do so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep well?&#34; Logan asks as I walk into the room and sit at the table. I look at him to see him looking at the papers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm...yeah,&#34; I say, taking a grapefruit from the fruit bowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; he says &#34;the others are in the pool room,&#34; he says as I cut open the grapefruit and then reach for the sugar. &#34;You should join them, I&#39;ll be busy again today,&#34; he says and looks at me. I look at him &#34;Although, I think I have an hour to spare to spend with you,&#34; he says &#34;and I&#39;ve told them that the meetings will stop at six tonight no later,&#34; he adds &#34;so don&#39;t plan anything for tonight because we&#39;re going out,&#34; he says and I nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well as exciting as this conversation is I&#39;m off to go be a pervert,&#34; Carl says standing up. I smile and watch him walk out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I say, turning to look at him. He looks at me &#34;About last night...&#34; I start but he cuts in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, I understand Yasmin told me a few things this morning and well it doesn&#39;t take genius why you would rather sleep somewhere else after how much I had drank,&#34; he says and I smile a little. &#34;And I lied last night, they ended up taking me to a strip club,&#34; he says and my jaw drops. He laughs &#34;I own like half of the strip club or something I&#39;m not too sure and well apparently it&#39;s tradition to go there every time we make a big deal and well I ended up there,&#34; he says and I just sigh and take a bit of my grapefruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you rather I didn&#39;t tell you and you hear from my uncle because I can guarantee he will take pleasure in telling you?&#34; he asks, causing me to frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would he take great pleasure in telling me that?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, never mind,&#34; he says, getting up and kissing the side of my head and walking out of the dining room and I&#39;m sure he couldn&#39;t leave any quicker if he tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look towards the door as it opens and in walks Melanie with Brendan behind her. I give them both a small smile and place a bit of grapefruit into my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why does no one wake me up?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because Logan always tells us you&#39;ll wake up when you wake up,&#34; Melanie says sitting down. I look at Brendan to see him sit down opposite me. He rests his head on his hand and gives me a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you feeling better?&#34; I ask. He nods in response and reaches for an apple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could be dying,&#34; he says with a small smile and I smile a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you&#39;re not, you&#39;re just homesick,&#34; I say and he just looks away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to come in the pool?&#34; Melanie asks me. I sigh a little and look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, I only packed one bikini and that was only just in case,&#34; I say and continue to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So?&#34; Melanie asks as if there isn&#39;t a problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I&#39;m not exactly in any rush to get my body out for everyone to see,&#34; I say looking at her. She sighs and rolls her eyes at me. She gets up and walks out of the room. &#34;What is her problem?&#34; I ask Brendan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t get me involved, I really don&#39;t know,&#34; he says shaking his head. I laugh &#34;I don&#39;t like arguments,&#34; he says and gets up and sits next to me. &#34;I get what you&#39;re saying though, maybe she doesn&#39;t and you might need to explain to her a little more, I mean my little sister is a little slow,&#34; he say with a smile and I smile at him and start to finish my grapefruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking into the room I&#39;m sleeping in I see Logan sat on the bed talking on the phone. He turns and gives me a small smile, I walk towards him and he pulls me onto his lap. He kisses my cheek and I lay my head on his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; he asks me quietly. I nod and stand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to get a shower,&#34; I say walking into the bathroom shutting and locking the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t understand how Melanie can&#39;t understand how I feel about my body, I&#39;ve explained to her numerous times how uncomfortable I sometimes feel in my own clothes and with Logan. I turn the shower on and fold my arms across my chest. What Yasmin said last night did make sense, but I don&#39;t understand why Melanie would be this petty over Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock at the door takes me out of my thoughts. I unlock the door and open it to see Logan. He walks in and shuts the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he asks. I frown at him and he smiles. &#34;I know you&#39;re upset about something so I want to know,&#34; he says and I smile at him. He walks towards the bath tub and starts to run the water. &#34;You can talk to me while you have a shower because I&#39;m getting a bath,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing wrong,&#34; I say and he just sighs and reaches for the bubble bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take a bath with me,&#34; he says and I shake my head. He looks down on himself. &#34;Megan just tell me what&#39;s wrong,&#34; he urges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing wrong, Melanie just did something that&#39;s all,&#34; I say. He sighs and hold out his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Turn the shower off and come here,&#34; he says. I sigh and do as he says. &#34;What did she do?&#34; he asks moving his arms around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think it&#39;s pathetic that I don&#39;t like to show my body?&#34; I ask and he frowns. &#34;She asked me to come in the pool but I don&#39;t really feel comfortable about it,&#34; I say &#34;and when I tried to explain it to her she just rolled her eyes at me as if it&#39;s pathetic of me,&#34; I explain. He sighs and move his hands up my sides and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand where you&#39;re coming,&#34; he says &#34;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re pathetic,&#34; he adds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She obviously does,&#34; I say and my eyes well up &#34;I just don&#39;t understand why she&#39;s being so nasty, all she does is make snide comments all the time towards us and I don&#39;t see the need for it,&#34; I says and the tear drops down my face. I wipe my tear and sit on his leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get upset over her,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t help but get upset over her, she&#39;s my best friend and she treats me like crap,&#34; I say and start to cry. He pulls me close to him &#34;Yasmin thinks it&#39;s because she fancies you,&#34; I say and he laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you serious?&#34; he asks. &#34;She hates my guts,&#34; he laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe I should start being a bitch back or something,&#34; I say and he&#39;s still laughing &#34;stop laughing,&#34; I say pushing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry but I just can&#39;t see it, she really doesn&#39;t like me,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but she did fancy you before I did,&#34; I say as he lifts me up and takes of his jogging bottoms. He shakes his head at my comment &#34;well she does, I don&#39;t know why,&#34; I say pouting a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I that bad?&#34; he asks and moves his hands to my top and slowly moves it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you cheat, lie and smoke weed,&#34; I say and he sighs as he takes my top off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well when you put it like that you make me sound like the worst boyfriend in the world,&#34; he says. I look down and he moves his hands down to my hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine I&#39;ll get a bath with you, but only because that bath tub is big enough for two,&#34; I say and take my shorts off. He turns as I take my underwear off and get into the nearly full bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still hate me,&#34; he states and I feel him get in behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what I did and I expect it,&#34; he says. I sigh and move the bubbles close up to me so I&#39;m pretty much covered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is the first time I&#39;ve been naked in front of you,&#34; I say changing the subject. I didn&#39;t like talking about what he did because I hated how it made me feel, I&#39;d rather just concentrate on right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah...well I have seen you naked but I didn&#39;t look, it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve been naked in front of you...well behind you,&#34; he says and I can hear the smile in his voice. I turn to look at him, he moves his legs at the side of me so I&#39;m in between his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel a bit nervous,&#34; I say. He moves his hands around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be, if it helps I can&#39;t see anything,&#34; he says pulling me closer to him and kissing my neck. &#34;And there&#39;s no need to be nervous I love your body,&#34; he says and takes my hands in his. &#34;We don&#39;t have to go in the pool, we can stay here in our nakedness,&#34; he says and I giggle. He leans forward and kisses me on the lips. He moves his hand up to my neck and strokes my jaw line. He pulls back &#34;That&#39;s enough of that,&#34; he says and I smile and lay back a little.</p>
