                <p>The sound of Max growling woke me from my dream. For the first time in a while I&#39;ve actually had a dream. A lot of the time I&#39;ve either had nightmares or slept too lightly to dream. I reach for the lamp and turn it on to see Logan shutting the door. He turns and looks at me and gives me a quick smile. I stroke Max&#39;s head and he lays his head back on his paws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know if it&#39;s not Brendan in bed with you it&#39;s him,&#34; he says, throwing his hands up in defeat. I smile and watch him climb onto the bed and climb on top of me to give me a kiss. &#34;I&#39;m glad it&#39;s him though,&#34; he says and I shake my head at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me you came in here the other night?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t important,&#34; he says, laying his head on my lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We didn&#39;t do anything, you know that right,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know that but thanks for clearing it up,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you go tonight?&#34; I ask looking at the clock to see it&#39;s half three in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I took my uncle out, got him cheating on his wife,&#34; he states. &#34;Plus I paid the stripper to get evidence of them sleeping together,&#34; he adds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know they were going to sleep together?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I paid her to sleep with him,&#34; he says and my eyes widen a little &#34;everyone has their price,&#34; he says and I shake my head &#34;I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be stripping for rest of the year,&#34; he says with a small laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d love to know how that conversation went,&#34; I say and he smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked her if she was going to sleep with him and if so if she&#39;d record some of it, she said she wasn&#39;t planning on sleeping with any one of us but said she&#39;d do it for a price,&#34; he explains. &#34;Turns out she&#39;s got a kid so I said if she sleeps with him, records some part of it and sends it to me and then keeps texting him, (you know flirting with him through text) I&#39;d set up a bank account for her kid and give her 50 grand,&#34; he explains. Then he gets up &#34;I said I&#39;d put 20 grand in the bank account for her kid, I&#39;m gonna get a shower, I smell like a bar,&#34; he says pulling his t-shirt over his head,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you not realise that you may have just changed that woman&#39;s life for the better?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah she said she&#39;d stop stripping if I actually did it, so I gave her half right in front of her,&#34; he says with a small chuckle. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to wake you by the way,&#34; he says leaning in and kissing me on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t it was Max,&#34; I say looking at the sleeping dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**--2 days later**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan wraps his arms around my waist as I take a sip of my coffee. I smile a little as he kisses my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone may see us,&#34; I say as I lay my head back on his chest. His arms tighten around me and he nuzzles into my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve not been able to touch you for the past two days, right now I don&#39;t care,&#34; he says in my ear and my smile widens. It feels nice to be wanted in a way that isn&#39;t sexual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still, we should be careful,&#34; I state. He turns me in his arms and presses his lips to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re all in bed,&#34; he pauses and caresses my nose with his nose. &#34;We have a few minutes before anyone else wakes up,&#34; he mutters. I place my cup on the counter and move my arms around his neck to move onto my tip toes and kiss him on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir,&#34; I hear David say. I pull away from Logan and he sighs deeply. &#34;Sorry to interrupt but Miss Wright has a phone call,&#34; he states and I frown while moving out of Logan&#39;s grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From who?&#34; I ask him. He hands me the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your grandfather,&#34; he says. My frown deepens and I take the the phone off him and hold it to my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello,&#34; I say and walk towards the stool at the counter to sit down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan honey, I&#39;ve been trying to get hold of you for hours,&#34; my grandfather says. Panic clear in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong? What&#39;s happened?&#34; I ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Jonathon,&#34; he says and I feel my heartbeat quicken. I can&#39;t think of anything to say. The thoughts going through my mind are horrendous. All I can think is that he&#39;s escaped or he&#39;s going free, but the panic in his voice makes that option seem impossible. &#34;We can&#39;t find him,&#34; he says and I think my heart has fallen into my stomach. I feel sick and I can&#39;t help but shake over the fear. &#34;He was in hospital following what happened and they went to check on him yesterday and he&#39;s gone,&#34; he says and my eyes fill with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W..where?&#34; I go to ask a question but I can&#39;t. My mind won&#39;t get past the fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ve checked the security feed but they just picked him up going outside for a smoke,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jonathan doesn&#39;t smoke,&#34; I state quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t,&#34; he corrects. &#34;He started smoking again when he returned home, I think it was the stress of everything,&#34; he explains. I sigh and roll my eyes at his ignorance. I have been under a lot more stress than he probably ever was but I haven&#39;t started smoking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you telling me?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s missing, no one knows where he is,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So he&#39;s escaped,&#34; I say and it comes out as a sob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We think so,&#34; he says slowly. &#34;The police are looking for him,&#34; I take the phone from my ear and hold it out to Logan. He takes it and starts talking to my grandfather. I move my head into my hands, what do I do? He may not know I&#39;m here but I&#39;ll be going back in five days, he&#39;ll find me and get me. I don&#39;t know if I can cope with the fear. Living in fear isn&#39;t something I want to happen again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I hear Logan say pulling me out of my thoughts. I look towards him to see the anger on his face. &#34;I don&#39;t know how they could be so stupid,&#34; he says clenching his fists. I look down at my lap and quickly wipe the tear that has fallen down my cheek. Logan moves towards me and wraps his arms around me. I push him away from me and get up off the stool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; he calls after me as I walk out of the kitchen. He won&#39;t understand how I&#39;m feeling, he&#39;ll just think I&#39;m been pathetic and tell me I&#39;ve got nothing to worry about when I have everything to worry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking into my bedroom I go to shut the door when Logan stops the door with his foot. He pushes the door open and shuts it behind him and pulls me into his chest. His arms wrap around me tightly as I start to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t let him hurt you,&#34; he says. I shake my head and move my arms around his waist clutching at his back. &#34;I promise you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why wasn&#39;t he been watched?&#34; I ask through my sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; he sighs. I hear the door open and I don&#39;t move. Right now I don&#39;t care who sees us hugging, I need this otherwise I know I&#39;ll do something I regret. I know that my mind and imagination will go into overdrive with worry and fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happened?&#34; I hear the person say and by the voice it&#39;s Melanie. &#34;Megan,&#34; she says and I feel her hand on my back. I can&#39;t even think of the words never mind say them without feeling my soul crumble. &#34;Logan why is she crying?&#34; she asks him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell you later,&#34; he states. &#34;Get your brother and Julie, Yasmin and Carl up,&#34; he tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; she says and walks out of the room and I know she&#39;s left the door open on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell them,&#34; he says pulling away from me and moving his hand to my tear stained cheek. &#34;Do you want to come down with me?&#34; he asks. I nod and he leans in and presses his lips lightly to mine. &#34;I&#39;ll die before I let him touch you again,&#34; he tells me and I smile a little at his determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise you&#39;ll never die?&#34; I ask and he smiles at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise I&#39;ll never die,&#34; he says causing me to smile and hug him again.</p>
