                <p>Megan</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*My heart pounds against my rib cage as I hide under the kitchen table, hoping he would just go to bed and let me clean myself up. His voice echos through my ears when I hear him call my name. I gulp down the lump in my throat and bring my hand to my mouth once I see his black booted feet. My tears come like a waterfall as the fear creeps as his steps come closer and closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Megs,&#34; he said once more. I squeeze my eyes shut trying to not make a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grunts a sigh and the chair in front of me scraping across the floor rips through our silent house. My eyes shoot open and I look straight at the chair. First I see his feet move round the chair, second  his legs are in front of me. My heart pounds harder ready to break free, I can feel my breathing becoming heavier and my whole body begins to shake in fear but sweat with nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;MEGS,&#34; he yells and then the sound of his fist colliding with the table. I jump a little and let out a small whimper that was thankfully masked by his grunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Please go to bed,&#39; I chant in my head &#39;please I&#39;m begging you,&#39; I repeat. I watch his legs bend so he&#39;s sat in a chair. I moved back a little trying to make as little sound as possible. His feet were only mere inches from my</p>
                
                
                
                <p>body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;I just want to play, I&#39;m getting bored of hide and seek,&#34; he mumbles. I take a deep breath and look around &#34;never mind I think I&#39;ve found you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart stops and I look around once more and then I see it, the mirror that had broken in the living room was on my left tilted against the wall. I see him sitting there staring at me with a small smile on his face. He pushes back on the chair making an ear splitting sound and bends down. I look at him and then start to scramble back. He grabs my foot but I kick out at him and get free and then push the chair out behind me and run with him behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I run straight for the back door checking around for the key. Panic starts to set in once I hear the kitchen door slam shut. I squeeze my eyes shut. &#34;Are you looking for this?&#34; I hear him ask. I turn to see him holding the key to the door. I collapse against the door in defeat. &#34;We don&#39;t play outside, you know that,&#34;he said while walking towards me. I close my eyes and take a deep breath, opening them again to see he is only a few steps away from me and then I see the belt in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please no,&#34; I beg. He sighs and clutches it hard in his hands. I seethed in a breath and decided to try and make another run for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I ran round the Kitchen Island and he blocked my way. I turned on my heels and headed for a draw taking out the rolling pin and just as I took it out he moved an arm around my neck squeezing tightly. He lifted me up from the ground so my feet were dangling and I moved my head down forcing his arm to loosen on my neck. Opening my mouth wide I clamped my teeth onto his bare skin sinking them in. He cursed and immediately let go of me. I fell to the floor and picked the rolling pin up and moved it between his legs and belted it as hard as I could into his groin. He dropped to the floor and I stood and ran from the kitchen through the dining room, into the living room and up the stairs to my room. I slammed my door shut and locked it and then ran into my bathroom shutting and locking the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping back I could feel the cold porcelain tiles under my feet and the tin metallic taste fill my mouth as the blood from my nose slowly entered and mixed with his blood. I gulped and walked towards the sink running the taps. It hurt to do anything and I didn&#39;t know why I was trying to clean myself up when in about five minutes he was just going to do it all over again to me. I cupped water into my bloody hands and splashed it onto my face and then cupped some more and poured it into my mouth and spat it back out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Looking in the mirror I barely recognised myself being a punching bag wasn&#39;t exactly making me look any better. I sigh and ran my hand through my hair and moved them to my stomach. Anger filled me it was his own</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*fault did he really think I wanted to have a baby with my own father. I clenched my fists and before I knew it I punched the mirror. Cracks splashed out from my fist and pieces of the mirror fell to the floor as I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*A bang made my body jump and then a yell. I took a deep breath; he was in my room already. &#34;You bitch,&#34; I heard him yell and then crashes and smashes filled my ears. My eyes wondered to a piece of cracked mirror on the floor. I reached out and took it in my left hand holding it tightly and raised my right wrist. A thud came from the bathroom door then another and then a bang and the door flung open.  His eyes glared at me and I looked him straight in the eyes &#34;What are you doing?&#34; he asks. I just stared back at him &#34;don&#39;t make me laugh Megs you don&#39;t have the guts,&#34;he said as he walked over to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you,&#34; I said and raised the piece of mirror and went to plunge it into my wrist when I felt someone take my hand. I looked to see Logan; I frowned and then watched as the walls started to fall back into darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*The look on Logan&#39;s face was cold, emotionless as if he had no soul. He pulled me up and then went to my ear &#34;I and no one else wants&#39; you,&#34; he whispered. I gulped and looked at him. He let go of me and started to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I said going after him fresh tears welling in my eyes &#34;please,&#34; I begged and then I felt someone grab me. I looked and straight away I wish I hadn&#39;t. Benjamin grabbed my hair and within seconds I came face to face with him. &#34;Logan,&#34; I screamed &#34;help me please I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I cried.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body shot up when I heard the biggest scream of my life, I could feel the pain in the scream as it faded out. I yawned and dropped down onto my bed and sighs while looking at the clock, 2:33AM stared back at me in neon green. A yawn escaped my mouth once more as I slowly sat up and ran my hands through my hair. Another night I wasn&#39;t going to get sleep and having to watch and make sure Megan didn&#39;t hurt herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the screaming stopped. I frowned and looked towards my bedroom door. It was very rare she woke up on her own. Max barked loudly causing me to jump a little and then her bedroom door opened and then closed. A few seconds passed and then I heard my door handle turn. I climbed back into bed and closed my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I heard her whisper once she had shut my door. I remained silent and then felt my covers get moved up and a weight on my bed. I opened my eyes knowing she wouldn&#39;t see anyway because of how dark my room was. She climbed into my bed and her head lay on my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bad dream again?&#34; I ask . There was silence and then I heard her sniff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; she said &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Waking you and for being a nuisance,&#34; she states. I sigh and moved an arm around her and got comfy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was the dream about?&#34; I ask . She sighs and slowly sat up while looking away from me, &#34;its ok you don&#39;t have to tell me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were in it this time,&#34; she suddenly said. My eyebrows raised as curiosity started to eat its way into me. &#34;You were only in it at the end but basically you weren&#39;t who you are now,&#34; she said and looked at me &#34;you told me you didn&#39;t want me and that no one wants me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened a little &#34;Well I&#39;ll never said that to you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I begged you to help me but you wouldn&#39;t you turned your back on me and walked away as if you didn&#39;t know me as if you didn&#39;t care about what happened to me,&#34; she carried on. I frowned once more &#34;And when I woke to find you not in my room I panicked and that&#39;s why I came straight to your room and when I saw you I just felt like I had to make sure it wasn&#39;t a dream or anything,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok, I don&#39;t mind and for the record I&#39;ll never stop caring about you,&#34; I said and took her hand in mine. She turned to look at me and then looked down. &#34;And I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I say. She looked back at me &#34;for scaring you the other night I&#39;m never normally like that and the fact I scared you so much that you thought I was going to hurt you, annoys me because I&#39;d never hurt you,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You promise?&#34; she asks. I nodded and hugged her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I do,&#34; I said and laid her down with me, &#34;get some sleep because I and you need the sleep,&#34; I state. She sighs and relaxed.</p>
