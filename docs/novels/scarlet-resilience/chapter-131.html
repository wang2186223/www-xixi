                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should head back,&#34; I state with little conviction because that is the last thing I want to do but I want it to be her choice. I&#39;m giving her an out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will, just not yet,&#34; she states and presses her lips to mine, her hand moves to the back of my neck pulling me down to her. I kiss her back and press her body to mine. I want her to know that just a kiss from her turns me on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands press on my chest before moving to the lapels of my jacket and pushing it off my shoulders. Taking one arm out of my jacket I then lift her up while removing it completely. I carry her to the large desk and place her gently down on it so she&#39;s sat and I&#39;m between her legs. Pulling away I look down at her. Last time we went further than a kiss she had a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re thinking too much,&#34; she says as she pulls my bow-tie loose. I wet my lips and tilt my head at her. &#34;I don&#39;t think you realise how safe I feel with you, I realised that tonight when I was here with your uncle and you walked in. The sense of relief that came over me at seeing you nearly made me collapse. The stories about you don&#39;t scare me, they make me know you&#39;d do anything for me and I like that,&#34; she smiles and I watch as her cheeks slowly turn pink. She closes her eyes before quickly saying &#34;in fact it kind of turns me on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opens one eye and bites her bottom lip as embarrassment flushes her face and I can&#39;t help but smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are beautiful you know that,&#34; I compliment. She shakes her head and looks down. I chuckle at her embarrassment, she turns an even darker shade of pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up and kiss me,&#34; she says pulling me by my shirt to her lips. I move my hand up her exposed leg and move the fabric of her dress out of the way with my other hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her tell me she&#39;s turned on is the sexiest thing I&#39;ve ever heard. Her shyness and embarrassment is alluring and sexy. I may be experienced but she can still make me feel like a horny teenager and she doesn&#39;t even know it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands move down my chest to unbutton my shirt, I move my hand to the zip at the side of her dress and slowly unzip her dress. She pulls away from the kiss and moves to pull her arm out of the sleeve of the dress. Leaning down I kiss her shoulder to her neck. Once her arm is free I feel her start to unbuckle my belt. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever felt her to be so confident in her actions towards me. Luckily she&#39;s not had a lot to drink so I know that this isn&#39;t alcohol fueled which I wouldn&#39;t want.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pull away as her dress slips down to her waist to see she&#39;s wearing a white lace strapless bra that has extra fabric under her bust. I look down at her legs and lift the fabric of her dress up slightly to see she has matching knickers on from the small bit of fabric I can see. She clears her throat drawing my attention back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See something you like?&#34; she asks with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just seeing if the knickers match,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I bought them with you in mind,&#34; she states, &#34;I&#39;m glad you like them,&#34; she adds and moves her hands down my body to the band of my boxers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like them very much, even better off,&#34; I state and move her back so that she&#39;s leaning back on the desk. I lift her hips up and pull her knickers down. I move back to kiss her on the lips. I pull back and look at her to see the lust in her eyes with a hint of nerves. Her tongue darts out to wet her lips ever so slightly. I can hear her breath quicken and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s from arousal or nervousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kissing down her chest, I gently pull the cups of her bra down and take one of her breasts in my hand and tease her dusty pink nipple while taking her other into my mouth. She moans and I can&#39;t help but be pleased. I enjoy pleasuring her, with other women I rarely wanted to pleasure them it was more I did it to get mine. With Megan I could pleasure her all night long without expecting anything in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My free hand trails up and down her leg, I love her legs, and when she wears heels they go on for days. Lifting it up she rests her foot on the chair and I take that as a sign she wants me to go further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand moves into my hair as my hand trails further up her leg. I caress the inner part of her thigh before moving my thumb to her sensitive clit. She moans my name and if my dick could get any harder it would. She&#39;s so responsive and I love it. She pulls on my hair slightly as I circle her clit with my thumb and her entrance with my finger. Slowly I enter her tight pussy with my finger gaining another delicious sound from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving my finger in and out I enter another digit as her body becomes a little more relaxed. I kiss back up her chest to silence her moans with a kiss. Her hand moves through my hair as she kisses me back. I pull back and place kisses down her chest but go further, down to her stomach. I glance up at her to see her watching me with the same heated look with a hint of nerves like she had only moments ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kissing her knee I trail kisses up her smooth thigh, letting her know my intentions. I pause giving her the chance to stop me. She doesn&#39;t, in fact she moves her hips up a little. Licking her inner thigh I pull my hand away before giving her pink flesh a taste enticing a small whimper of pleasure from her. I start slow making her pleasure start at a slow burn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; she moans, &#34;more,&#34; and at her request I&#39;m happy to oblige.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s hand moves through my hair as her climax builds. I know she&#39;s close, she did this last time, and her moans change to this cute and sexy little whimper. Her grip tightens on my hair and she climaxes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kiss back up her body as she catches her breath and I&#39;m not going to lie my ego just grew. I feel like I need to give myself a pat on the back. Kissing up her neck I go to her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ok?&#34; I ask. She nods, I look at her to see her eyes are closed. She opens them and gives me a lazy smile her cheeks and neck flushed pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was perfect,&#34; she says as she lazily touches my bare chest. I stand straight and take her hands in mine to pull her up. I move her hair from her face and kiss her. One of her hands moves down to my boxers and I think of stopping her but last time she looked almost hurt at the fact I told her she didn&#39;t have to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulls away and kisses a path down to my neck as her hand pulls my boxers down freeing my dick. Saying I&#39;m hard right now would be an understatement, I&#39;ve been hard the moment I saw her in this dress. I place my hands on her chest as she starts to massage my dick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; she says catching my attention. I move my hand to her chin and tilt her head up to look at her. &#34;I want to go further,&#34; she admits. I kiss the top of her head &#34;Can we?&#34; she asks and I know exactly what she&#39;s asking. &#34;I know you said we were to wait until I finish school, but I&#39;m old enough and I know I want to,&#34; she explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to too, but not here,&#34; I state and I feel her disappointment as she sighs. &#34;You&#39;re worth more than a quickie on a desk at a party,&#34; I state and she looks up at me, those emerald green eyes are my undoing everytime. I&#39;m stating the truth, she&#39;s worth more to me than this. I&#39;d rather take my time with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; is all she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like before I want to pleasure her too. It&#39;s the hottest thing when I&#39;m able to watch her orgasm as she gets me to come. I move a hand down to her wet core. She moans as I enter with two fingers. I look at her to see it&#39;s a moan of pleasure. She smiles and leans in to kiss me. My other hand I move to cup her jaw as I kiss her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; she pants and her hand moves faster, I match her pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come for me Megan,&#34; I say. She looks me in the eyes and I can feel my orgasm on the brink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck,&#34; is all I can say and then I hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opens.</p>
