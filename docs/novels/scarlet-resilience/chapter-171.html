                <p>&#34;What about anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marijuana,&#34; he nods in response, &#34;any more questions?&#34; I ask. He shakes his head and sits down on the sofa next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever?&#34; I say and stand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be like that,&#34; he says, looking up at me. I put my smoke out, walking out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth is he&#39;s right, I have been using since England, my usage isn&#39;t as bad as it was the first time, but I&#39;ve still relapsed. Every time I take a hit I tell myself it is the last time, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s terrible though. I can go days without anything, so I wouldn&#39;t say I had a problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking upstairs, I pass Megan&#39;s room to hear Max whimpering inside. I frown and open it to see she&#39;s having a nightmare. Max paces up and down her room before nudging her hand with his snout. The only light is coming from the moon outside her window, casting long dark shadows into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking my t-shirt off, I climb into bed next to her and wrap my arms around her waist. Max sits, staring at me as I try to calm her down. Her body turns into my arms and slowly relaxes. I stroke up and down her back with one hand, the other I move through her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok,&#34; I whisper and hold her as tight as I can. Max settles down and gets in the position to sleep on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan relaxes, and so do I. It feels incredible to have her in my arms. If I hear her having a nightmare, I can&#39;t stop myself from coming in. I usually leave once she&#39;s settled, but with how she&#39;s laying right now, I don&#39;t think I could go without disturbing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s times like this I wish I weren&#39;t leaving, I also wish I knew why she decided to break things off. She says one thing to me but does another. She could have gotten Sara to ring anyone else but me. She didn&#39;t. I was the one she wanted to know about her session. Why? When she acts as if she hates me. It frustrates me that I could work out her sick uncle but can&#39;t work her out at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts are interrupted when I feel her hands move, and then her lips pressed to my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moves to press her lips to mine, automatically I kiss her back. Her hands move up my chest, around my neck to pull me closer. I move on top of her and lift her to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time we kissed she got angry, is this time going to be the same? The only difference is this time is that she has nowhere to run, as this is her room. That and she was the one to kiss me first this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan bites my bottom lip, and it&#39;s the hottest thing. Since her, I can only get off by thinking of her. I&#39;m rock hard right now, and she&#39;s the only woman to ever do that to me from a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I move my hand up from her hip, underneath her pyjama top and graze my thumb over her pebbled nipple. My other hand I move to her pert bum, pressing her to my body and hell does her body feel good. She moans and moves her hands down my bare chest to the waistband of my shorts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barking makes us both jump apart. I switch the lamp on to see Max with his front paws on the bed, and he&#39;s growling at me. I sigh before looking at Megan. She looks away from me and then gets off the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need the toilet,&#34; she mutters and walks into her bathroom, quietly shutting the door behind her. I glare at Max to see him move onto her bed and then lays down looking up at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to take you out back if you do that again,&#34; I threaten. He whimpers and then covers his snout with his paws. I sigh and stroke his head. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, you did the right thing,&#34; I say and sit on the edge of her bed waiting for her to come back out. She didn&#39;t seem annoyed; I&#39;m half expecting her to come out and have a go at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bathroom doors open, she walks out and gets back into bed without saying a word. She gives Max a little pat on his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to get back into bed or sit there for the rest of the night?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; I say and get back into bed. I turn the lamp off and face the back of her head. So this response wasn&#39;t the one I expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Three days later.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up Tuesday morning, Megan was gone. She hadn&#39;t said much to me since then, but she seems to be keeping herself busy. When she&#39;s not at school, she seems to spend her time in the gym training with David. Brett has asked me several times if I can talk to her for him, but I&#39;m not sure what I can do for him. Yes, she&#39;s ignoring him, but I don&#39;t know why. Given what she had said that day in the gym, all that comes to mind is that she&#39;s angry with him, most likely because he never told her anything. If it were me, I&#39;d feel abandoned by him. She probably feels like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past few days she&#39;s stayed in, last night after her session she locked herself in the games room. Carl said she seemed to be honing her &#39;Call of Duty&#39; skills. By the sound of the profanities coming from her, I agree with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the plus side, she also has had Sandra take her to and from school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out of my classroom, I walk towards the office to go to the mid-week meeting, when I hear a commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t walk away from me!&#34; I hear someone snap. I look to see Tyler yelling at Megan. He has a hold of her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get off me,&#34; she snaps and tries to get out of his grasp. I notice others have stopped to look at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me where you were last night,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have, I was at home, now get off,&#34; she snaps. I look around for Sandra, but she&#39;s nowhere to be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liar,&#34; he argues and pulls her towards him to then push her into the lockers, winding her. I move forward before I&#39;m even realising. &#34;Tell me the truth,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t tell you again, Tyler,&#34; she warns. He doesn&#39;t let go of her, and before I can get to her, she grabs hold of one of his fingers and bends it right back. I stop and watch as she breaks his finger, making him let go of her. She then pulls her fist back and punches him in the face. &#34;I told you to let go,&#34; she says and then slams her locker door shut. &#34;I was at home all day, just like I was for the last five days, so the rumours you&#39;re hearing are false,&#34; she clears up. &#34;Just because I haven&#39;t slept with you for a while doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m sleeping with anyone else, I&#39;ve slept with five people so leave me the fuck alone,&#34; she huffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five people, I was told four by Sandra.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan turns and looks at me. She looks like she wants to cry. Instead, she covers her upset with anger. Tyler walks after her and grabs her by her arm again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck,&#34; he growls. She looks at him; he lifts his other hand as if he&#39;s going to hit her and I can&#39;t help but step in this time. I grab him and move him away from her. His focus is wholly on her, and it&#39;s a little worrying. I pin him up against the lockers with his arm behind his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone to class now,&#34; I bellow, as the bell went throughout this altercation. Everyone quickly runs to get to their class. It&#39;s then I see Sandra walking over to us. I turn to Megan. &#34;Except you,&#34; I snap. She nods and folds her arms as Sandra stands next to her. She asks her what&#39;s going on. I look to Tyler and then let go to then turn him around. &#34;What&#39;s your problem?&#34; I ask. &#34;You were just about to hit her, do you want to explain that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She hit me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you wouldn&#39;t let go of her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course you&#39;re going to take her side,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This boy is so lucky that we&#39;re in a school right now. I&#39;d be beating him to a pulp if I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on here?&#34; I hear Mrs Kitson ask. I let go of Tyler and step away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; Tyler says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard a commotion, Tyler decided not to heed Megan&#39;s word, so she clocked him in the face which lead to him nearly hitting her, I stopped it,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d heard something along those lines,&#34; she says and looks at Megan. I do too to see she is using her hand to cover the bruising appearing on her arm.&#34;Megan, go to my office. Tyler, see the nurse. &#34;I will review the footage on the security cameras,&#34; Megan nods and walks off towards her office with Sandra following. I look at Tyler and take him by his arm to the nurse. The principle follows me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you get the camera installed?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This weekend, they&#39;re only on a few hallways, mostly by the entrance and lockers,&#34; she explains. &#34;I sent an email,&#34; she adds.</p>
