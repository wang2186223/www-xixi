                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had given her half an hour extra and she still wasn&#39;t home. I wasn&#39;t worried but I wasn&#39;t at ease after all she was at a kind of party I would have organised when I was 17 which consisted of drugs, alcohol and sex. Pretty much what most parties consisted of but this party I knew would be at an all new level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front door to the house opened and a guy I had known since I was 15 stood there with his eyes half lidded and a bear in hands. His eyes widened &#34;fuck me what are you doing here?&#34; he asks drunkenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve come to pick someone up,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Aiden the ledge is here,&#34; I sigh and walk into the house and just what I thought was happening was happening. The guy he had shouted walked up to me and smirked. His build was smaller than mine, he had blond hair and green eyes and was full of piercings. Last time I had seen him his hair was bright green.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sup,&#34; he said and remarkably he was only stoned. Then a girl in her underwear ran past me giggling and some red haired guy ran past me but went into my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch it fucker,&#34; he says. I looked at him and raised my eyebrows &#34;Sorry,&#34; he said &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to, I thought you were someone else,&#34; he said and walked off and soon started chasing the girl again. I sigh and look at Aiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen a girl about this tall with brown hair, intense green eyes, really thin?&#34; I ask . He cocked an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has she got a name or is she called a girl this high with brown hair and intense green eyes?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh your student that you saved from her cunt of a father,&#34; he paused and turned &#34;Yeah she&#39;s downstairs with some Brendan man that girls a freak,&#34; he said and walked off into another room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great,&#34; I said, sighing and noticed some girl looking at me.  &#34;Duncan,&#34; I say. &#34;How many times has she been here?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was here the other day with Brendan like Aiden said she&#39;s a freak,&#34; he paused. &#34;But then again, what girl isn&#39;t when she&#39;s had a few beers down her,&#34; he says. I sigh and walk towards the kitchen and down the cellar to see it was exactly the same as it was when I used to throw parties. Chairs, couches, beds, a sound system and a new flat screen TV was all that was in the room and a few mini fridges. The cellar was big after all; the house itself had four large rooms on the ground floor. I walked round couch after couch trying to find her but I hadn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan that&#39;s enough,&#34; I heard someone say. I looked around and they were in an armchair. She sat across his lap kissing him. She had her top off and was obviously drunk because she hated the scars on her back to be shown. I sigh and walk over to them, picking up her top and then grabbing her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get dressed,&#34; I snapped. She looked up at me &#34;Now,&#34; I growled and looked at Brendan. Everything in me stopped me from kicking the shit out of him. I looked at Megan to see she was now wearing very short torn shorts and high heeled boots. I sigh and watch her put her top on to see it was just as revealing. I then watched her reach down for her jacket stumbling a little. I looked away from her back at the boy I wanted to kill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed sat where he was staring back at me, then a small smirk went across his face as he stood up while keeping his eyes on me. He buckled up his trousers and looked at Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m proud of you Logan,&#34; he said, now looking at me. I clenched my fists &#34;I mean to be able to control the anger that you have in a situation like this takes pure skill,&#34; he says, &#34;No I&#39;m kidding you can punch me if you like I&#39;d punch me I mean that was very douche like,&#34; he said and grabbed Megan by the jacket she was wearing which was obviously his. I watched him as he pulled her into a kiss which made me look away and lean against a couch arm. After a few seconds I started to get impatient and grabbed Megan by her arm. She looked at me as I pulled her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going home,&#34; I snapped and started to drag her towards the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re hurting me,&#34; she whined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care,&#34; I snapped and dragged her up the stairs and then dragged her through the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See ya,&#34; Duncan called as we made it out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; she says. I ignored her and once I had gotten her to the car I opened the passenger door and shoved her in. I hadn&#39;t been this angry with someone for a while. I clenched my fists and got in the driver&#39;s seat to drive her home. After several minutes I looked at her to see she had her head on her lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much have you had?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much what?&#34; she asks now slowly sitting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much alcohol have you had?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t keep count,&#34; she said and laid her head on the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What drugs have you been taking?&#34; her head snapped at me &#34;I&#39;m not stupid or blind,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure,&#34; she said and brought her legs to her chest while wrapping the jacket around herself. I turned on the heating and concentrated on driving. There was no point in me trying to talk to her; she obviously didn&#39;t want to tell me what she had taken. I just hoped this was a one off after all her having a drug problem was one thing I didn&#39;t want to worry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh escaped me as I drove into the driveway and came to a stop. I looked at her to see her head was still on her lap and she was sweating. I got out of the car and walked round to her side of the car and opened the door. She didn&#39;t move at all, she just sat there with her head on her lap. I bent down and picked her up. She shot up, looked at me and then calmed. I moved her out of her seat and shut her door and pressed the button on my keys to lock up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I said looking down at her. She didn&#39;t say anything. I sighed and dropped her legs and moved her arms around my neck, then I picked her legs up again and walked up the steps to the front door. I kicked the door a couple of times and then Carl opened it. He frowned as he stood staring at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happened?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s taken something, I don&#39;t know what but I&#39;m guessing she took an E,&#34; I said as I walked into the house. He raised his eyebrows and shut the door. I walked up the stairs and he followed. I laid her onto her bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes opened and she frowned &#34;how did I get here?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I brought you here,&#34; I state. She looked at me and her frown kept in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so beautiful,&#34; she said and moved her hand to my face. Carl chuckled a little and I took her hand from my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; I said and looked down. She giggled and stroked my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So pretty,&#34; Carl laughed and sat down on the floor facing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he really Megan?&#34; he asks. Her head shot at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god your eyes are so mesmerising they&#39;re like brown jewels. She sat up and went to get off the bed but I stopped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan just stay here,&#34; I said, moving, holding her down by her arms. She groaned and turned away so she could get out of my grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to,&#34; and she pushed me up and then sat down in front of Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow,&#34; she said slowly, touching around his eyes. He looked at me and started laughing, I smirked and looked at her to see her giggling too. I had to admit it was good to see her smile for once but hearing it under the influence of drugs just made it even more fake. She then jumped up and stood in front of me. &#34;Oh wow,&#34; she said, moving her hands through my hair &#34;so soft,&#34; she said &#34;it&#39;s like soft,&#34; she said amazed. Carl laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Megan that&#39;s what we&#39;ve realised his hair is soft,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...no this is really soft,&#34; she said, moving both her hands through my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said, taking her hands in mine. She looked at me in the eyes and she looked so innocent it was unbelievable. She smiled and then moved a finger onto my chin and moved it to my lips. She smiled and moved forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re soft too, that&#39;s amazing,&#34; he said still with that amazed look on her face. Then within a second she kissed me. My eyes widened and Carl laughed. She pulled back and smiled giving me an eye closing smile while giggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was that fun?&#34; I ask . She nodded and then sat on my lap and laid her head on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re like a big teddy bear,&#34; she paused. &#34;Ooo ooo I got a joke,&#34; she said happily &#34;I lost my teddy bear,&#34; as soon as she started Carl burst out laughing. I moved my hand to her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan please go to bed,&#34; I begged looking at her. I felt her lips curve into a smile as she looked at me, I slowly let go of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you come to bed with me,&#34; she said cheekily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh wow she actually asked it,&#34; Carl said standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You too,&#34; she said looking at him. &#34;we could make it a, what&#39;s the word,&#34; she said clicking her fingers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A threesome,&#34; Carl said, smirking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ooo yeah,&#34; she said, obviously remembering the word now. &#34;I like that Idea Carl that is a good idea, I should have come up with it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl, go to bed,&#34; I ordered. He sighs and walks out of the room shutting the door behind him. I looked at her and moved her onto the bed, getting her to lie down. She moved her hands around my neck and pulled me down to kiss me once more. I pulled back and she groaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so mean,&#34; she whined. I sigh &#34;You don&#39;t like me,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not true, you&#39;re high and drunk and I really don&#39;t want to do this when you are like this,&#34; I said, stroking her arm. She shrugged my hand away and folded her arms. &#34;Ok,&#34; I sigh &#34;if I kiss you will you go to sleep,&#34; She turned to look at me and nodded like a little child. I sigh again and slowly lean in to give her a kiss. She smiled and slowly kissed me back. She then pulled back, I frowned now I was confused. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; she said and pulled me by my shirt and kissed me. She moved her hands down my back and pulled my top up. She then pushed me back and moved on top of me. I pulled back and she sat up while looking down at me. She bit her bottom lip and I slowly sat up. &#34;You&#39;re amazing,&#34; she said and hugged me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re better than me,&#34; I said and hugged her back. She smiled and kissed me and I slowly moved her back down onto the bed and moved my hand down her body to her thigh. I pulled back and moved off her. She sat up &#34;You said you&#39;d go to sleep now go to sleep,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok then,&#34; she sighs and starts to get into her bed. &#34;Stay with me though,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry I&#39;m going to,&#34; I state which was the truth. I didn&#39;t want to leave her here when she had taken something. I really did not want to pull away from her but I had to after all she wasn&#39;t herself. Once she was asleep I moved to the chair by her bed and sat in it and took the blanket that was resting on the top of it and moved it around myself.</p>
