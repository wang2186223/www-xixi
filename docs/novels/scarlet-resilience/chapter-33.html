                <p>Logan and I stood outside my former house. I gulped as I folded my arms, there was police tape around the garden and on the front door way. I hadn&#39;t been this scared to enter a house before let alone my own home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything bone, nerve, muscle and organ told me to turn back and run for it. My body did not want to step onto the garden, never mind inside the house I had been tortured in. &#34;We can do it&#39; a voice in my head said as I stepped forward and reached out a shaky hand to pull up the police tape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to go?&#34; I heard Logan ask. I looked at him and brought my hand back clutching it to my chest. I slowly nodded and looked down at my feet. &#34;Where&#39;s the spare key?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm, it should be one taped underneath that big rock over there,&#34; I said pointing to where there was a now dead rose bush with a cluster of rocks around it, &#34;It&#39;s the greyish one,&#34; I say. He nodded and went under the tape and went towards where I had told him. He looked under the rock and then turned to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There isn&#39;t one,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm...there should be,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The police may have found it,&#34; he says. I sigh and watch him stand and walk towards the front door. He then bashed his elbow into the left hand corner window by the handle. My eyes widened a little and I looked around to see if anyone had heard the crash of the glass breaking, but luckily no one was coming to their windows. I turned back to Logan to see him trying to unlock the door and once he had it clicked open. &#34;How do I turn the alarm off, before it goes completely off and draws attention?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh the code is one, seven, zero, six,&#34; I said quickly. He nodded and walked into my previous home and I could hear him pressing the buttons on the alarm. He then popped his head out of the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not working,&#34;he states. I frowned as that was the alarm code. He sighs &#34;Never mind,&#34;he said and then I heard a crash and then the alarm box came flying out of my previous homes front door. I frowned. Then I heard a door unlock, I looked and it was my previous neighbour, she opened the door and stood with her arms folded and as soon as her eyes landed on me they widened. I gulped and looked at her brown eyes. She was around her mid thirties and a single parent. She had dark brown hair and she had a little girl aged six. I gave her a small wave and looked towards the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hurry up,&#34; I snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well where am I going to find it,&#34; I heard him call back. I sigh and take my phone out of my pocket. I scrolled down to his number and called him. &#34;You can just tell me without ringing my phone, &#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It should be in Ben. I mean Jonathon&#39;s room, in the wardrobe,&#34; I said, correcting myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok give me a second I&#39;m disabling the alarm,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just did that,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I took the cover off so I could get to the wires,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you, some friggin bank robber,&#34; I snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could be, you don&#39;t know,&#34; he says. I sigh &#34;calm down,&#34;he said &#34;I&#39;ve done it,&#34; and then I saw him walk past the front door and walk up the stairs. I then looked back at my neighbour to see she had gone inside. I sigh in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had sighed too early because then I noticed practically every curtain in the street twitch. I sigh &#34;Logan please hurry,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am but I can&#39;t find it,&#34; he said &#34;it&#39;s not in here as well it&#39;s empty,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh in frustration and hang up. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes and then ducked under the tape and walked briskly into the house. My heart pounded out of my chest as I looked around. First the cupboard he had locked me in and the couch he had raped me on countless of times. Then came the carpet that was stained with my blood. I clenched my fists trying my hardest to keep away the tears that wanted to come. I slowly walked up the stairs and kept my eyes up on the ceiling. There was nothing on the ceiling that would make me remember anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I heard Logan say. My eyes went directly at him. He smiled a little and then held out his hand and I watched as the cross on the necklace dangled down. I let out a sigh of relief and walked over taking the necklace in my hands. He walked over to me and hugged me &#34;I&#39;m proud of you,&#34;he said and moved his arm around me leading me out of the house.His arm dropped as we saw people in the street standing looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you, people will now look at me as if I&#39;m an animal at the zoo or a show at the circus,&#34; I said and walked as fast as I could towards the car. I hated this street, the people in it were like the people in desperate housewives, they loved a bit of gossip no matter who they were gossiping about. &#34;Logan, can you open the car?&#34; I ask . I got no reply. I turned to see he was just standing there looking at the people who were standing in a group looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think she&#39;s been through enough?&#34; he asks as he walks towards them. My eyes widened as I watched him walk towards them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan come on just leave it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he said and looked back at them &#34;do you?&#34; he asked &#34;I was not asking a rhetorical question,&#34; he snapped. I sigh and look out opposite to see his aunt walking towards us. I looked back at him &#34;come on answer,&#34; he snapped. Which made them all nod while muttering &#34;so why does she need to go through you looking at her as if she is a freak show?&#34; he asked and he got no answer &#34;Again it is not a rhetorical question,&#34; he snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t,&#34; they all said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So why is she?&#34; they remained silent &#34;And people wonder why I hate society,&#34; he said to himself &#34;you&#39;re all obviously selfish twats to not think about her feelings before you all decided to gather in your little gossip group, and you all obviously have very dull lives,&#34;he said and started to go away &#34;I know 16 year olds who are less dim-witted and selfish than you, you should be ashamed,&#34;he said and walked towards me. I looked at them to see them all looking at their feet looking very sorry for themselves. I sigh and look at him. He gave me a small smile and unlocked the car for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; his aunt asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, I was just telling your neighbourhood friends how dim-witted and selfish they are,&#34; he said with a small smile. She sighs and shakes her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t insult people again did you?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s not an insult if it&#39;s true,&#34;he said and got in the car. I got in after and sat in the passenger seat clutching my mother&#39;s necklace. His aunt gave me a small smile as we drove away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you do that?&#34; I ask, looking at him. He sighs as the car slowly stops at a red light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you think?&#34; he asked and looked at me &#34;they shouldn&#39;t have been doing that and you know it and they know it I was just pointing out how rude and ignorant they were,&#34; he states. I sigh and look at the traffic light &#34;Does it bother you that much that I stuck for you?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No it&#39;s not that I just want to go through days without any drama,&#34; I say. He sighs and takes my hand in his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing bad will happen from what I did so no need to worry,&#34; he said, squeezing my hand. I looked down at the hand he had wrapped around mine. He moved his fingers in between my fingers and stroked my hand with his thumb. &#34;I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re tired,&#34;he states. I looked at him to see him focused on the road &#34;you were asleep when I returned,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I didn&#39;t get much sleep last night,&#34; I state and looked back down at our hands that were now interlocked. I closed my eyes and slowly moved my hand out of his grasp and folded my arms. He cleared his throat and I looked out the window. I stared out of the window for the remainder of the ride home.</p>
