                <p>I walked towards her grandfather and sat where she had sat. Her grandfather gave me a weird look and then sighs and then looked at me once more &#34;I&#39;m guessing she went out last night,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can smell the alcohol on her,&#34; he paused &#34;and judging by your blood shot eyes you stayed up all night,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not all night I just wanted to make sure she was ok because she had taken something,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighs once more &#34;Maybe she should have more than one session with the psychologist and also the nurse asked me about some nutrient fattening drinks,&#34; he states. &#34;I&#39;ve ordered some and they should come sometime this week, she has to have one three times a day, one with every meal and she should put the weight back on,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well that&#39;s a good thing,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah it is, I need to go,&#34; he said, getting up and straightening his coat. &#34;I&#39;ll call later and tell you more about things,&#34; he explained. I nodded and escorted him out. Once I shut the front door I let out the breath I was holding while he was here. Then I felt some arms go round my waist and move up and down my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong honey bunny?&#34; Carl asked. I quickly cringed away from him and turned round holding my fist up ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will hurt you one day,&#34; I snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was just a hug,&#34; he said innocently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned and started to walk up the stairs &#34;You just don&#39;t understand that sometimes you just go too fucking far,&#34; I snapped and walked to my bedroom. I opened my door to see Megan sat on my bed plaiting her hair. She had gotten changed out of the clothes she was wearing last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has he tried it on with you again?&#34; she asked and turned to look at me. I sigh and nodded and walked towards the bathroom while taking my top off. &#34;We&#39;re not being very true to our word,&#34; she states. I walked out of the bathroom and stood in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think we should do?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; she said putting her head in her hands &#34;it confuses me but I sort of like it because you make me feel better,&#34; I sigh at what she said and grabbed my desk chair and sat on it while looking at her. She stood up and looked down at me, &#34;Maybe we should have some time apart,&#34; she suggested &#34;maybe then we&#39;ll learn how to keep our hands off each other, because we do need to do that. I mean you&#39;re back at work next week which means you&#39;re going to start being a teacher again and a week after that I&#39;m going to start being your student again,&#34; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you feel when you&#39;re with me?&#34; I asked  as I looked up at her. She sighs and sits back onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel completely free, like nothing bad has ever happened to me,&#34; she paused and a small smile crept across her face &#34;and when you touch me it&#39;s like what my father used to do to me never happened because I feel so comfortable with it,&#34; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean when he raped you?&#34; I asked and watched her flinch at the word &#39;rape&#39; which meant she still hadn&#39;t come to terms with it. She nodded a little. I sigh &#34;Megan you have to come to terms with what he,&#34; she cut me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to talk about that? Please can you for once not bring it all up when we are talking?&#34; she asks as she stood up again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I just think you should talk about it sometimes,&#34; I state. &#34;But I will refrain from bringing it up all the time, we will talk about it when you want to talk about it,&#34; I explained. &#34;I don&#39;t think we should have some time apart because it&#39;s obvious it won&#39;t work,&#34; I said and reached for her hand and pulled her on top of me. She looked at me and smiled as I held both of her hands. I sigh and look down. &#34;I really can&#39;t believe I&#39;m going to ask you this, but will you go out with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat on his lap registering what he had just asked me trying to understand why he was asking me that. &#34;Logan what you&#39;re asking will ruin your career and not to mention your life if we ever got caught,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s if,&#34; he states and moves his hands down my body to my hips.  &#34;The chances of us getting caught are slim because we live together,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not just that I&#39;m not ready and you get stoned nearly every night and last night I took something I don&#39;t even know the name of because I didn&#39;t care what I was taking,&#34; I explained &#34;it&#39;s just not rational for us to be together,&#34; I explained. He chuckled and cupped my face in hands and then kissed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then pulled back, &#34;It&#39;s a yes or no answer Megan. Will you go out with me?&#34; he asks again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled and blushed and slowly nodded at him and pulled him into a kiss.  He moved his arms round to my back and I moved my hands up his chest. I felt his tongue lick my bottom lip. I smirked and was determined to not give him entry as well, I wanted him to work for it after all now he was my boyfriend. He pulled back after a few more seconds and then kissed me again and this time taking me by surprise and bit my bottom lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth opened for him and his tongue entered. His hands moved to my hair and he pushed me closer to him.  I pulled back and moved my hands from his hair. I then climbed off him and leaned in and gave him a peck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;m off to go get a shower,&#34; I said and went to walk out when he got up and grabbed me by my hand and pulled me into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll have one with you,&#34; he said and kissed me while pushing me into the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa there horny Harry, I actually need a wash,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah so do I, I&#39;ll wash you and if you want you can wash me,&#34; he said with a smile and leaned in to kiss me again. I pulled away and felt him start to kiss my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan, go take a cold shower by yourself,&#34; I said, pushing him fully away and then pulled the door open and walked out of his room. I sigh and run my hand through my bangs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s how I feel when I&#39;ve been in his room,&#34; I hear Carl say. I giggled and walked to my room and he followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem happy,&#34; he states as I sat down on my bed and reached for my phone. &#34;Did you two do naughty things that I wasn&#39;t part of?&#34; he asks while folding his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by naughty things?&#34; I ask . He smirked and walked over to me sitting on my bed and crossing his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know exactly what I am on about,&#34; he paused and then pulled at the hair band that held my hair in a plait and started to unravel my plait. &#34;Now explain,&#34; he practically ordered. I shook my head and smiled while looking through my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He asked me out,&#34; I stated and then got a message from Brendan. &#34;And I said yes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right, am I the only one that sees the error in this soon to be disastrous relationship? He&#39;s a teacher and you&#39;re his student, this cannot work,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what I said, but he wouldn&#39;t take that as an excuse and said something about we&#39;d only get caught if we told people that would out us. Plus something about it&#39;s easier for us because we live together,&#34; I explained. He tilted his head a little as if thinking of the logic to what Logan had said. &#34;Now leave while I get a shower,&#34; I said looking at him. He sighed and got up and started to walk out of my room but stopped and turned &#34;No you cannot join me,&#34; I snapped. He huffed and his bottom lip pouted out. I rolled my eyes and closed the door behind him and then got a shower.</p>
