                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get back into bed. I&#39;d just woke up with the strongest urge to pee in the world. After doing my business, I didn&#39;t miss the soreness between my legs, and I had a sudden flashback to the morning after Jonathon stole my virginity from me. Only this time, I don&#39;t have the same feelings of hurt, shame, and disgust. If anything, I feel happy. I&#39;m glad I was able to be intimate with him and know that I&#39;m not damaged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laying next to him, I watch him sleep. He&#39;s honestly a beautiful looking man. His hair is a mess, but it&#39;s the right kind, the kind you just want to run your hands through. He&#39;s got model looks, most of the time he looks like he&#39;s just stepped off a Prada ad. With his high cheekbones and strong, broad jaw with a smattering of stubble that frames his kissable lips. There are two holes just below his bottom lip, he hasn&#39;t worn his piercings for a while, and it looks like they&#39;re healing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His right arm moves up to cover his eyes as the morning sun slowly makes it through the window. I smile to myself and run my hand down his chest and back up. Slowly I trace my finger over his skin, making my way to his dark nipple. I watch as the fine hairs stand up and his breathing falters a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making my way down his body, and over his chiselled abdomen, the sheets only just covering him. I trail my fingers up and around his belly button. I stop just above the sheet and look back to his face to see he&#39;s still asleep. Biting my bottom lip, I contemplate on what I&#39;m about to do. I take a deep breath and slowly let it out. I just have to be brave. I want to do this, and I want to follow how I&#39;m feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving my hand below the sheet, I lift it a little to see his dick is already semi-hard. Slowly I trail my fingers up the length of his shaft and back down to his balls and watch as he becomes harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small sigh escapes Logan&#39;s lips as his penis fully hardens. I look at him with my heart beating hard in my chest to see he&#39;s still asleep. I sigh in relief. I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll be angry, surprised more than anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly I lick up his length to his tip before taking him into my mouth. His leg moves, and I feel his body tense a little before fully relaxing, and his breathing picks up. Quickening my pace, I watch as his mouth opens and his hand moves down his body to my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his arm moves from across his eyes, and he looks down at me. He jumps back a little causing him to slip out of my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; he says as I kiss up to his neck. I straddle his hips and press my core to his penis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; I say in his ear as I slowly lower my body down onto him. He groans as he moves into me and I can&#39;t help but smile. I like being in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck,&#34; is all he says as he holds his hands at my hips and tries to take over. I take his hands in mine and move them above his head, pinning them there. He looks me in the eyes as I control the rhythm that we go at. I raise an eyebrow at him in question and he nods. I smile and take my hands from his knowing he&#39;ll let me have this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrap a towel around myself as I watch Logan step out of the shower we had just shared. After waking him up this morning, we laid talking before I left his room to get a shower in mine and get changed. It seemed he had other plans when he came and joined me in the shower. I swear this guy does not get tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julie once told me she found it disappointing that most guys she had slept with tend to roll over and snore once they got theirs. It would seem Logan is an exception to that rule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for a smaller towel I start to pat my hair dry. Logan walks towards me and takes the towel from my hands to dry it for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do I feel like you&#39;re going for some sort of world record,&#34; I state, turning to look at him. He smirks and leans down to kiss my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve had so much sex I&#39;ve lost count,&#34; I say and he laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the one that woke me up in a very good position,&#34; he states, I raise my eyebrow at him, &#34;and I can&#39;t help it, I feel if I get my fill of you now I&#39;ll be able to control myself better when we get back,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, when we get back we can&#39;t really sleep with each other until I leave my job,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I say shocked and he laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sound upset by that,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well that will take ages, does that mean we can&#39;t fool around either?&#34; I ask, moving my hands up the front of his body. He tilts his head in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure,&#34; he states and moves his hands to my hips. He presses me to his body and then lifts me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I don&#39;t like this,&#34; I state, &#34;it&#39;s like you&#39;ve dangled forbidden fruit in front of me, given me a piece and took the rest away, that&#39;s cruel.&#34; I huff and he chuckles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can have it now,&#34; he says looking up at me and I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh really?&#34; I ask him and kiss him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squeezes my butt as he opens the bathroom door and carries me out. He moves one hand down my thigh and pulls my leg onto his hip making my towel loosen a little and ride up and right at that moment we hear someone clear their throat. We pull away from each other and look to see Yasmin, Julie and Melanie sitting on the bed staring at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan slowly releases my leg and lowers my feet to the floor. I feel myself becoming flushed with embarrassment. Julie is sitting there with a big grin on her face, Yasmin has her hand to her mouth stifling a giggle and Melanie looks shocked more than anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn to Logan to see him smirking. He leans forward and kisses my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess we&#39;ll finish this later,&#34; he says in my ear and then pulls fully away from me. He turns to the girls. &#34;Ladies,&#34; he says and I see Julie&#39;s eyes move down to his towel-covered groin. I don&#39;t think I could become anymore embarrassed right now as he&#39;s sporting a rather impressive tent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good Morning,&#34; Julie says and Yasmin and Melanie laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out,&#34; I tell him and he laughs before leaving my bedroom. I quickly grab my clothes and run back into the bathroom to get dressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once dressed I walk out and go straight to the vanity to blow dry my hair. I feel all eyes on me as I turn the hairdryer on. I quickly glance at them to see they&#39;re trying not to laugh at me. After drying my hair I turn to them and mentally prepare myself for their questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on,&#34; I say with a sigh. Julie looks the most excited to discuss this out of all three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well we heard everything so all I wanna know is all the details,&#34; Julie states and I laugh a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing really to tell,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just had shower sex with your teacher, there&#39;s plenty to tell,&#34; Julie states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I did,&#34; I say rubbing my palms on my dress. I had decided on wearing a belted shirt dress as I&#39;d looked at how the weather was going to be back home and well, it&#39;s mostly shorts and t-shirt weather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was that the first time?&#34; Yasmin asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That we had sex or the first time we had shower sex?&#34; I ask. &#34;Because that&#39;s a no to both of those,&#34; I answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, wait, start from the beginning then,&#34; Melanie interjects.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, we had sex for the first time last night and just now that was...,&#34; I pause as I count mentally how many times we&#39;ve actually had sex. &#34;Seventh time, the second time in the shower,&#34; I continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I.want.to.know.everything,&#34; Julie slowly says and I laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seven times,&#34; Yasmin nods &#34;impressive,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he make you orgasm all seven times?&#34; Julie asks and Yasmin and Melanie both look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh god,&#34; I say, feeling my face go red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? A woman doesn&#39;t get off every time and if he made her every time I think I need to get myself a hot English teacher too,&#34; she states and I laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes and more Julie,&#34; I state and her eyes widen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m never looking at him the same way again after this,&#34; she states and I laugh as she flops back onto the bed. &#34;I&#39;m so happy I&#39;ve come on this trip,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up I quickly glance in the mirror before reaching for my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we going down for breakfast then?&#34; I ask and look at all three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah cause you&#39;ve worked up an appetite,&#34; Julie states as she sits up and gets up off the bed. I shake my head in response and walk out of the room.</p>
