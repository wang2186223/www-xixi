                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you stop it,&#34; I snapped at Logan. He looks at me and sighs &#34;Just stop touching me all the goddamn time,&#34; I growl as I walk out of the kitchen with my glass of water. He hadn&#39;t left me alone all day. I&#39;ve only been up for an hour and he just won&#39;t leave me alone. It&#39;s irritating. I admit I&#39;m on edge because I&#39;ve had no sleep but it&#39;s annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s Saturday which means I&#39;m off shopping; Yasmin had gotten a yes from her parents so I was going shopping with Melanie, Julie and Yasmin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan walks into the living room and sits on the other couch. He looks at me and then away to the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you having those nightmares again?&#34; he asks. &#34;I mean you&#39;re not taking your medication anymore and I&#39;ve noticed you not sleeping,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; I said and down my water. He sighs and l look away from him. &#34;I&#39;m off to get dressed,&#34; I said and walked up to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes I was having the nightmares again but it isn&#39;t just that he doesn&#39;t seem to understand that sometimes I feel claustrophobic when he starts to touch me and I get almost scared of just how far he wants to go. I know I&#39;m probably sending him mixed messages and I honestly don&#39;t mean to, it&#39;s just I do have my off days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pull on my black skinny jeans and button them up; I turn in the mirror and look at my scars. I hated these scars so much; they didn&#39;t look like the type of scars to fade more like the type of scars to darken. Logan is always saying he doesn&#39;t mind them and that he likes them but how can anyone like these. He either has a scar fetish or he is truly lying to me whenever he said it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok Poppet?&#34; I heard Carl say from my closed door. I sigh and look down then reach for my top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; I said and pulled on my top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I do your hair today?&#34; he asks. &#34;I&#39;m thinking of a fishtail plait,&#34; he said and I picked up my brush and started to brush through my hair. &#34;Or waves, I love your hair when it&#39;s wavy,&#34; he states &#34;I guess I&#39;ll just talk to myself then,&#34; he said and I smiled a little. I wasn&#39;t being rude, I just wasn&#39;t in the mood to talk. It seems he is being literal with talking to himself as he starts to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Carl, how are you? I&#39;m fine thank you how are you Carl?&#34; he asks himself and I smirk a little &#34;Well my friend won&#39;t talk to me it&#39;s annoying really. Aww don&#39;t worry Carl you&#39;re still awesome. Thanks Carl so are you,&#34; Then there&#39;s silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I start to part my hair and turn on the straightening irons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know Carl you look very hot today,&#34; Carl suddenly say&#39;s and I sigh &#34;you almost turn me on. Thanks Carl I feel the same way, my body is aching for your touch,&#34; he said and I laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swear that sometimes his mind is not all there. He wasn&#39;t a person you could not laugh at. Who in their right mind stands and talks to themselves it&#39;s just not right. Granted I&#39;ve done it before but only when I&#39;m thinking out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl I&#39;m having my hair down,&#34; I said loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is that voice coming from? Is that you god? I always thought you were a girl,&#34; he said and I stifled my laugh and went to open the door &#34;if you are not god then show yourself,&#34; he demands and I open the door. He stands with a smile on his face. &#34;Why won&#39;t you let me do it?&#34; he asks with a sad expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;ve already done it,&#34; I said and he huffs &#34;tell Logan I&#39;m going shopping now and that I&#39;ll see him soon,&#34; I said walking away. I feel him grab my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he asks, looking me in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; I said and moved my arm from his hand &#34;tell him I&#39;ll see him soon and I&#39;m taking the BMW,&#34; I said and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you ignoring him? What has he done?&#34; Yasmin asks me as I decline another phone call from Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing and I&#39;m not ignoring him, I&#39;m with you three right now,&#34; I said and all three looked at me. I smile and look away from them as I place my drink to my lips gaining a cream moustache. I lick my top lip and place the mug of caramel hot chocolate on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So why don&#39;t you tell him that instead of ignoring him?&#34; Julie asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and open up my salad box. I&#39;m not annoyed with him, I&#39;m more annoyed with myself for getting upset with him over a nightmare I know won&#39;t happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shall I ring him then to show you all he&#39;s done nothing wrong?&#34; I ask and Melanie sighs and gets up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m off to get a cookie. Does anyone want one?&#34; she asks. I shake my head and so do the others and then watch her walk off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what&#39;s going on because it&#39;s obvious you don&#39;t want to speak in front of Melanie?&#34; Yasmin asks. I sigh and look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not doing anything wrong I&#39;m just having an off day and taking it out on him, I don&#39;t mean to but it seems all I seem to do is direct all my anger to him and I can&#39;t stop,&#34; I sigh and lean back in my chair. &#34;The only reason why I&#39;m not saying it in front of Melanie is because I know she&#39;ll just boil it down to the fact he cheated,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it?&#34; Julie asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, because I&#39;ve only started being angry with him today it&#39;s like I woke up hating him,&#34; I said and look at them. &#34;He keeps asking what he&#39;s done wrong but I keep ignoring him, I&#39;m being a bitch aren&#39;t I?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Yasmin said and then leaned back in her chair as if thinking about it. &#34;I think it&#39;s understandable, everyone takes their anger out on the person they care about the most and you really care about him,&#34; she said &#34;and it&#39;s just unfortunate for him that you are letting your anger out on him, I let all my anger out on my little sister all the time,&#34; she said and I smile a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m going to ring him just to tell him I&#39;m not annoyed at him,&#34; I said and stood up. &#34;I&#39;ll be back in a minute,&#34; I said and walked to a more secluded part of the coffee shop where hardly anyone goes. I dial his number and sit in the chair waiting for him to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; he said &#34;whatever I&#39;ve done I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t done anything, I&#39;m just having a bad day,&#34; I said quietly and looked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you bought anything?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bought a few dresses, tops, jeans, jumpers and shoes,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dresses?&#34; he asks, sounding quite surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, why?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No nothing,&#34; he said &#34;I&#39;ve got something for you,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, what?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a surprise, we should pack tonight as well so we don&#39;t have to do it all tomorrow,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, do you want me to get anything while I&#39;m out?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you get me some hair wax and some hair gel?&#34; he asks. I smirk &#34;you&#39;re laughing,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not,&#34; I said as my smirk turned into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes you are, I can hear you or you&#39;re smiling,&#34; he states. &#34;If Carl was asking you this it would be completely normal,&#34; he said and I laughed.  &#34;See, you even agree,&#34; he said and I smiled to myself. He sounds so different on the phone it&#39;s a little strange it&#39;s like he sounds more British if that&#39;s even possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I said and he went silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One minute,&#34; he said and then I heard movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just need to sign there and there sir,&#34; I hear a girl said, causing me to frown &#34;thank you, here&#39;s your receipt,&#34; the voice said again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; I hear Logan said and then movement again. &#34;Sorry, carry on,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was that?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A shop assistant,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which shop?&#34; I ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not telling,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re in the city?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to meet us?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok I can then get my hair stuff myself then, but you&#39;re not getting your present until we get home,&#34; he said and I smirk a little</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where would you like to meet me then?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;McDonalds Julie wants to eat something fatty apparently,&#34; I said and he laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok see you soon,&#34; he said and I smiled and put the phone down. I sit back with the girls and smile to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m guessing the phone call went well with that smile on your face,&#34; Yasmin said and smiles at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s going to meet us. You don&#39;t mind, do you?&#34; I ask them both. They shake their heads and then Melanie returns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mind what?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan meeting us,&#34; I said and straight away I notice the dislike of that idea in her face. I sigh and look at my phone. &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter, I&#39;ll tell him I&#39;ll just see him at home,&#34; I said as I start to text him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No..no it&#39;s ok I don&#39;t mind,&#34; she said and I look at her. &#34;I don&#39;t mind,&#34; she said and smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cool I told him to meet us at McDonalds because we&#39;re off there next aren&#39;t we?&#34; I ask. They nod and I start to finish my salad.</p>
