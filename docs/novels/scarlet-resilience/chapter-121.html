                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His kisses move from my lips to my cheek and then down my jawline to my neck. I tilt my head up a little to allow him more access. The feeling of his hands is cool against my skin as they move under my top pushing it up and over my breasts. His fingers teasingly press over my nipples making my breath shake. He smiles and pulls away from me to pull my top over my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t leave a love bite this time,&#34; I say looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t, I don&#39;t want anyone to know we&#39;re back together,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me neither,&#34; I say and it seem my sentence peaked his curiosity as one of his eyebrows rises. &#34;When people know they tend to stick their noses in and push you with their opinions, this is our relationship it is only us that need to know about it,&#34; I say moving a hand through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly what I was thinking although there is someone else who needs to know,that someone is Carl,&#34; he says and I smile at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, you tell Carl, and I&#39;ll tell Yasmin,&#34; I say &#34;Now shut up and continue lavishing my body in kisses,&#34; I say and he smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Miss Wright,&#34; he says and starts to kiss my neck again, then down my collar bone to my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like the sound of that,&#34; I say with a slight giggle and undo the drawstring of his bottoms. He moves down to my chest licking over my breasts and then down in a straight line to my belly button. I breathe in as his hands moves over my rib cage to the hem of my bottoms. I lift my hips slightly as he pulls my bottoms off. &#34;No one can hear us can they?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he says against my thigh and kisses it. I move up onto my elbows and watch him as he takes my bottoms off fully. His fingers wrap around my ankle and he looks at my body, the look of lust is clear in his eyes. &#34;You&#39;re way too beautiful,&#34; he says quietly and moves his hands down to my panties. His eyes on mine as he pulls them down my legs. Flicking my tongue over my dry lips I try to calm my nerves. I know where this is going and my nerves aren&#39;t out of fear but of excitement, to know that this man is going to pleasure me to the point of getting rid of the bit of pain Benjamin has caused me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips press onto my thigh and up to my sex, his eyes still on me. I moan at the feel of his tongue licking and teasing round my clit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I breathe and collapsed back on the couch as his hand laces with one of mine like the time in Paris. His day old stubble is rough against my skin contrasting against the softness of his tongue. I wonder if I ask him to keep the stubble would he find it strange or if I&#39;d be out of line. I don&#39;t really need to tell him why, would I? He doesn&#39;t have to know that because of him I now have a fondness to men with stubble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulls away and slowly moves his fingers over my sex. I feel him kiss up my stomach as he moves a finger inside me. He licks in my belly button and swirls his tongue inside it before nipping a bit of skin between his teeth. I lace my fingers through his hair, I want to feel his lips on mine but it seems he has other ideas as he moves down my abdomen to my clit and flicks his tongue over it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breaths start to come in short and fast as he moves two fingers in and out of me in fast long movements. I start to squirm and instinctively move my hips to meet every thrust his hand makes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah Logan please,&#34; I cry in pleasure but I myself don&#39;t know what I&#39;m asking him for. I know that my orgasm is near. I had read stories that many women had never experienced an orgasm, and many didn&#39;t experience one until they were in their thirties or forties. Yet Logan knows my body enough to give me one. My back arches, my toes curl and I close my eyes as the orgasm rips through me like a hurricane. I untwine my fingers from his and hold onto his wrist for some sort of support, my other hand is still in his hair but I can&#39;t help but pull on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan kisses back up my body to my neck and then looks right at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next time remind me to wear a hat otherwise I&#39;m going to have no hair left,&#34; he says with a small smirk &#34;and you need to cut your nails,&#34; he adds and I roll my eyes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I say and move my hands up to his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be, I like it really, turn me on a bit,&#34; he says with a shrug of his shoulders. He then pulls fully away from me and I watch him as he moves my panties back onto my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think anyone heard?&#34; I ask,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, not unless they had their ear to the door,&#34; he states and moves my panties up my legs. &#34;And so what if they did, they won&#39;t know it&#39;s us,&#34; he says laying at the side of me. I sit up and let him lay on his back so I can lay on his chest. &#34;I think we should stay in here for the rest of the day, only because I can&#39;t face people at the moment,&#34; he says and I look up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I ask and kiss his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl is very pissed off at me, my uncle is on the war path and well I keep getting asked why I broke up with you,&#34; he explains and I smile a little as I slowly move my hand to the waistband of his joggers. I hadn&#39;t missed the bulge in his bottoms and as last time my hand is shaking. He takes my hand in his and moves it up to his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only person being pleasured today is you,&#34; he says and kisses my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But,&#34; he cuts me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have plenty of control Megan, I&#39;m fine,&#34; he pauses &#34;I won&#39;t have control if you touch me,&#34; he says and looks at me &#34;especially if you touch me with this gorgeous mouth of yours,&#34; he says leaning in and kissing me on the lips. I smile and kiss him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turns out that on the wall with the fireplace behind one of the panels is a door and it&#39;s a bathroom. It seems his grandfather didn&#39;t like leaving his study. THis room is full of surprises, on the wall opposite the bathroom there&#39;s a hidden TV and sound system. along with rows and rows of DVD&#39;s but I have a feeling that&#39;s Logan&#39;s touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;David is going to bring us some food,&#34; Logan says as he looks away from his phone to me. We had turned the couch to face the TV &#34;Do you want anything in particular?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I&#39;m happy with whatever he brings,&#34; I say and move onto his lap so I&#39;m straddling him. He look up at me as he texts on his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you planning?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Uncle,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what I want to hear while you&#39;re on my lap,&#34; he says cutting me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me finish, I have an idea as to how to get back at him for what he has done,&#34; I say and move my hands down his bare chest. &#34;We&#39;ll play him at his own game, he has a lot more to lose than you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your point?&#34; he asks, moving his hands up my thighs and resting them on my hips just under his t-shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to catch him cheating on his wife,&#34; I say and he looks at me his blue eyes searching me &#34;When you have the evidence of his infidelity and anything else, we&#39;ll tell him together that if he doesn&#39;t leave us alone we&#39;ll destroy his life,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like this idea,&#34; he says with a small smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s not exactly a law abiding citizen,&#34; I state and he just smiles at me. &#34;Catch anything, maybe go through some of your company books, they&#39;re will be something off I&#39;m sure of it and then when we approach him, we also tell him that he&#39;s going to accept half a million to leave the company fully seen as you&#39;re taking over and if he has any issues with that then we can always show his wife and the police just what he&#39;s been up to,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm so devious it turns me on,&#34; he says with a big grin and kisses my neck. I smile and move off him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;People need to learn they can&#39;t mess with us,&#34; I say and peck his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes they do,&#34; he agrees and watches me as I walk away from him to the hidden bathroom. I do my business and then wash my hands.</p>
