                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body shivered as I stepped away from Brendan, my hand still clasped in his. He pulled me towards him and I stumbled into him. He took his jacket off and wrapped it around me. I moved my hands into the arms of his jacket and smiled at him and then we continued to walk back to the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about half an hour it started to rain heavily. I grabbed his hand and pulled him to where there was shelter. He looked at me and I took his jacket off. &#34;Megan,&#34; he said, frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here,&#34; I said, handing it to him. He folded his arms &#34;Just put it on,&#34; I say, he did as I told him and put the jacket on. I smiled and moved my arms to the inside of his coat and hugged him, &#34;This is warmer,&#34; I say. He chuckled and looked down at me while moving my hair away from me. I smiled and leaned up on my tip toes and gave him a kiss. He kissed me back and moved his hands to my hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan and Brendan walked into the mansion, shutting the door behind them. They were completely soaked from head to toe. Megan took her jumper off and shivered. &#34;It&#39;s fucking freezing,&#34; she said and started to take her soaked jeans off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes because getting naked is going to warm you up,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No stupid but keeping wet clothes on is just going to keep me cold,&#34; she said and gathered her hair to the side. I watched them from the doorway. &#34;Take your clothes off so they can dry too,&#34; she says. He raised an eyebrow, &#34;I know you&#39;re not used to a girl telling you to take your clothes off that is why I understand your shocked look,&#34; she says. He shook his head at her comment and she sat on the bottom step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was hurtful,&#34;he said and knelt down to her level and took her hands in his and pulled her up with him. &#34;C&#39;mon bed, I&#39;m shattered,&#34;he said, turning her and pushing her up the stairs. She started to walk up the stairs and he picked up her clothes and then looked at me. He then looked away and followed her up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh passed my lips as I turned into the living room. I wasn&#39;t hurt, I was more disappointed. She didn&#39;t seem to understand that I only do the things I do for her. That box she was too dependent on, she didn&#39;t need it. I had told her she could talk to me but then it seemed she didn&#39;t want to or was it she couldn&#39;t. If she couldn&#39;t then that meant I wasn&#39;t the best person for her to be with at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat back on the couch and looked at the box she desired earlier on. It was a wooden box with different shades of brown making it look like it was made from different types of wood. It had a gloss shine to it and a brass latch on its front. I moved my hand over it and picked it up by the lid. It was heavy but I knew that was because of the box itself not from what was inside. I flipped the latch open as I placed the box on my knee and opened the box. The interior of the box was lined with dark red velvet. If anything I&#39;d said this box was supposed to be kept for jewellery rather than blades and bits of broken glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh once more and laid down while closing the box lid and placing the box back on the coffee table. I closed my eyes and moved my hands behind my head. I looked at the clock to see it was half three in the morning. Staying up all night wasn&#39;t my plan but I wanted to make sure she was home and I wanted to see what state she was in when she did come home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I heard footsteps and then the door opened and then quietly closed. I opened my eyes and waited till the person came into view. My eyebrows rose as I watched Megan walk to the liquor cabinet. She opened a drawer and searched it. She was now wearing pyjamas. Her bottoms were black silk and she wore a red tank top to go with them. It seemed they were a set because the bottoms had red lining at the bottom of them and the top had black lining around it. She sighs and places her head in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stupid fucking key,&#34; she growled. I raised an eyebrow at her swear and smirked a little. She sighs again and searches the drawer next to the one she had just searched. &#34;Yes,&#34; she said and took what I assumed was the key and shut the draw and started to unlock the cabinet doors. She opened them and then looked around trying to pick out which one she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would stop her but she would have to turn around at some point and she&#39;d see me then. I watched her reach up on her tiptoes for the clear bottle at the top. Her fingertips touched the bottle but that was it, she couldn&#39;t reach. &#34;Trust good stuff to be at the top,&#34; she said to herself. &#34;And why can&#39;t I reach?&#34; she asked herself and stopped trying to reach for it and instead climbed on top of the ledge on the cabinet and reached for it. &#34;Brains of America,&#34; she said to herself as she read the bottle. She unscrewed the top and sniffed it but then shot it back but then brought it to her lips. She took a swig and then brought the bottle down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urgh,&#34; she said and climbed back down and screwed the top back on and closed the cabinet doors, locked them and placed the key back in the drawer she found it in. I watched her turn and then jump; her eyes landed on her box and then back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which one did you pick?&#34; I ask . She didn&#39;t reply to me, she just stood there staring. &#34;I&#39;m guessing from the red top and the writing on it, it&#39;s tequila,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing down here?&#34; she finally asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it look like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why aren&#39;t you in your bed?&#34; she asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The couch is comfier than my bed,&#34; I lied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up at the clock and then looked back at me. She walked over to me and placed the bottle on the coffee table and then went to pick her box up but I reached for it too, &#34;It&#39;s mine,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right so get your hand off it,&#34; she hissed and glared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I said and took my hand off the box and turned on my stomach, &#34;do whatever you want I don&#39;t care about you no more,&#34; I state. Which was true, why should I care for someone who hates me? I could still feel her standing staring at me. I sigh &#34;What are you waiting for? A fucking bus&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When are you leaving?&#34; she asked and it almost sounded like she was crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When school breaks for spring break,&#34; I said, which meant I was leaving in about seven weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s...&#34; she stopped what she was going to say and I could hear her breathing become heavy. &#34;Ok,&#34; she said and then I heard her pick up the bottle and a few seconds later I heard the door shut. I sigh and turn on my back staring up at the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You idiot,&#34; I said to myself and covered my face with my hands &#34;you made her cry,&#34; I growled at myself and looked at the table to see she had taken the box and the alcohol.</p>
