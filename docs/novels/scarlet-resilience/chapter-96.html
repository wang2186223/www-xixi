                <p>Taking the clip out of my hair I look at the clock to see it&#39;s nearly eight pm. Logan told me to be ready for six. I know it&#39;s not his fault it happened all the time with my mother and father, they would plan to do something and my father would turn up hours late because of meetings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock sounds at my door. I look and call for who it is to come in. The door opens and in walks Yasmin. She looks at me and gives me a small smile. I watch her walk towards the bed and sit down on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you heard from him yet?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I texted him though,&#34; I say sitting on the bed with her and kicking off my shoes to sit fully onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe his battery is low,&#34; she suggests. I nod and ruffle my hair. &#34;Are you and Melanie still not talking?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No she decided to ignore me when I came downstairs to join you all and I really don&#39;t care anymore, it seems to me that she wants attention,&#34; I say. &#34;Do you think I should clip my hair back or have it down?&#34; I ask changing the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, you&#39;re right, and have it down,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Julie I haven&#39;t seen her all day? I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s been spending a lot of time with Logan&#39;s friend,&#34; she pauses &#34;the short one,&#34; she says and I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scott, he&#39;s a cool guy, I think the first thing I said to him was about his height,&#34; I say and she smiles &#34;I was drunk though,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were drunk a lot last year,&#34; she says and I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I felt happier,&#34; I say with a shrug of my shoulders,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t get out of control though,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm now that I think about it, that night we first saw Logan if we hadn&#39;t I would of ended back at his anyway,&#34; I say and she frowns. &#34;Carl,&#34; I say answering the questioning look on her face. She slowly nods and then frowns and then she&#39;s in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god I totally forgot that you and him you know,&#34; she says. &#34;Do you talk about it?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s as if it never happened,&#34; I say and sit down on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does Logan know?&#34; she asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not too sure but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever want him to know,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah knowing that your best friend saw your girlfriend naked before you ever did isn&#39;t exactly a pleasing thought,&#34; she says and I smile a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t see me naked,&#34; I huff and she laughs &#34;he just saw parts,&#34; I say trying my best not to make it sound as bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that what you can remember?&#34; she asks and I pout at her. &#34;How come you didn&#39;t see Logan when you left?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, I think he was at his aunts and uncles,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t get how you two didn&#39;t do it, I mean you were both out of it,&#34; she says and I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t really remember,&#34; I say &#34;you should ask him, I think he remembers more than me because he swore in the morning that we didn&#39;t,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you believed him?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At the time I didn&#39;t care if we had or hadn&#39;t because I don&#39;t remember it, now though I am a bit because I&#39;d want Logan to know,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t that cause arguments though?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Most likely but it would be better now than later on,&#34; I say and she nods. It would cause more than an argument I know exactly what would happen but for my own sake I don&#39;t want secrets in our relationship, especially secrets as big as that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you need to speak to Carl and get the ins and outs,&#34; she says and smirks a little. &#34;Or would you like me to do it?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You,&#34; I say straight away and she smiles. &#34;It&#39;ll make it awkward if I ask,&#34; I say and she nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing I start to tie my hair up as I get ready for bed, it&#39;s nearly half ten and Logan hasn&#39;t come back yet. I tried to ring him after Yasmin left which was at nine but it went straight to voicemail. I&#39;m not angry, I&#39;m</p>
                
                
                
                <p>more upset. I was looking forward to doing something with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud sound echoes through my bedroom. I walk towards the window to see a helicopter, I frown and watch as it lands outside the mansion. The turbines start to slow down and then come to a complete stop. I watch as Logan steps down out of the helicopter and then turn to the pilot. He says something to him and then runs towards the mansion. I hear the front door slam shut and then his phone goes off which means it wasn&#39;t switched off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone goes silent and then the door opens and he walks in. He looks tired like today had just taken everything out of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; he says walking towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; I say and walk back towards the mirror to take my make up off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can still go out, you haven&#39;t eaten yet have you?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No we can&#39;t and no I haven&#39;t,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t we?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan it&#39;s half ten most places are probably closed or closing,&#34; I state. He sighs deeply obviously frustrated and upset with himself. &#34;It&#39;s fine we can go out tomorrow,&#34; I say looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No c&#39;mon I know a place where we can go for something to eat,&#34; he pleads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan, it&#39;s fine honest I&#39;d rather just stay in now and do something with you tomorrow, why do you want to go out so much?&#34; I ask while wiping my face with a face wipe. He sits down on the buffet and places his hand on my leg. I look at him to see anger expressed across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just don&#39;t want to be the same as my father or have our relationship go the same way as my parents relationship, when I walked in and saw that look on your face it was the same look on my mother&#39;s face the first few times my father never showed up to take her somewhere.&#34; He pauses &#34;She only stopped looking like that when she stopped caring for their marriage and because she stopped caring they both just cheated on each other all the time,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;m not going to cheat on you ever and just because it happened with your parents doesn&#39;t mean it will happen with us, my father turned up late all the time to dates with my mother but they would always get round to having those dates,&#34; I say to him and he shakes his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not the same,&#34; he mutters and moves his hand up my leg and into my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you eaten?&#34; I ask and he shakes his head. &#34;Well why don&#39;t we just order something?&#34; I ask and he looks away from me. &#34;Logan I&#39;m not bothered what we do together as long as we&#39;re together, I don&#39;t need taking to fancy restaurants I&#39;m happy with a greasy take away and a crap movie,&#34; I say with a small smile and he looks at me. &#34;Ok lets make a deal tomorrow you can spend as much money as you want creating the perfect day as long as we get to have a night in right now,&#34; I suggest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will do something tomorrow,&#34; he says as if its a must. &#34;I&#39;ll make sure I&#39;ve got nothing planned, I promise you,&#34; he says and I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I say and look back at the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go order us a takeaway. What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surprise me,&#34; I say and start to take off my makeup. He walks out of the room shutting the door behind him. After a few seconds the door opens again and in walks Yasmin. I look at her and give her a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything ok? Are you not going out now?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes and no we&#39;re not, it&#39;s too late to go out now,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh but you were looking really excited to go out,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I know I was, it would have been nice to have some time on our own but we&#39;re going out tomorrow instead,&#34; I say and she smiles.</p>
