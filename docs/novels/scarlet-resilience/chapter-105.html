                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is fine I don&#39;t feel like I have no control, he&#39;s letting me do what I want and he even said that we&#39;d go at my pace, go with what I&#39;m happy with and stop when I want us to stop. It just makes me think that all my fears are pointless; I know he&#39;s never going to force me to do anything or pressure me into anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He starts to unzip the back of my dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mental self takes a deep breath, he&#39;s only unzipped my dress it&#39;s not like he&#39;s gone and ripped it off me. I just have to calm down. But now this means he&#39;s expecting me to take this dress off. I unbuttoned his shirt though so it&#39;s only fair that I allow him to undress some part of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand moves to my shoulder and pulls on the thick strap of my dress pulling to down a little. His body presses against mine as he moves up a little lying between my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve not been topless in front of him before or even been in my underwear in front of him before. Yes maybe this time I feel some sort of expectations of where this night will lead us but I want this. I want our relationship to progress to become one of a physical, sexual nature. I can feel his weight on my body. Like it&#39;s pinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s a voice within my head that tells me that he&#39;s not different that given the chance he&#39;d do the same things to me. But that&#39;s not true I know he would never hurt me like that. That&#39;s not his nature. The voice although it started off faint and small seems to be getting bigger and louder as I feel the pressure of his body on mine. As I feel his hands caress my body and his kisses move from my lips to my neck and collar bone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#39;Get him off,&#39;* it shouts &#39;*he&#39;s the same they&#39;re all the same, if he doesn&#39;t get to this time he&#39;ll just cheat on us again with a woman that&#39;s willing to pleasure him, he won&#39;t stop even if you tell him to,&#39;* I know the voice is wrong I know that because he&#39;s told me and promised me. He cares about me and will stop if I tell him to. &#39;He won&#39;t,&#39; it shouts at me as if I&#39;m stupid and not listening, like it&#39;s angry with me for believing him. I want the voice to stop, I want this and I want the voice to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan&#39;s hand moves up my thigh as he kisses my chest. My hand is locked in his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#39;You&#39;re stupid Benjamin was right, about everything, why would Logan even want us after what he did to us, it&#39;s obvious all he wants is this,&#39; the voice cries.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan kisses back up my neck to my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#39;See,&#39;* the voice says. Why won&#39;t this stop. The voice is wrong it&#39;s just the part of me that&#39;s scared and it&#39;s wrong. *&#39;You&#39;re wrong,&#39;* it screams *&#39;you&#39;re going to get us hurt again because you won&#39;t listen,&#39;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know what has come over me but I can&#39;t stop myself. I push Hogan off me and out of nowhere punch him in the face. I crawl back against the head board and hold my dress up. I can&#39;t look at him and I can&#39;t stop myself as I start to cry. My mind is going crazy why is this happening I want to move on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s staring at me. I can feel him. A knock sounds. It&#39;s the door. Logan moves away from me. I take a deep breath and hold my hand to my face. He&#39;s angry he&#39;s got to be. I&#39;d be angry if someone just randomly hit me with no excuse. He&#39;ll hit me back. My eyes widen, I need to say sorry, I need to get out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your dessert sir,&#34; I hear our waiter from downstairs say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Logan says. His tone doesn&#39;t sound angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir you&#39;re bleeding,&#34; the waiter says. I gulp, why can&#39;t I move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, yes I just slipped in the bathroom, too much wine I think,&#34; he says with a fake chuckle. &#34;It often makes me dizzy,&#34; he says. &#34;Thank you for the dessert,&#34; Logan says trying to dismiss him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome sir, if you need anything else please let us know, there is also a first aid kit in the bathroom,&#34; the waiter say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Logan says and the door is shut. Then there&#39;s silence. I move to the edge of the bed and move my head into my hands. I hear a pop of a cork and it makes me jump. I look behind me to see he&#39;s not there. I hear clinking glasses and then pouring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s some wine,&#34; Logan says catching my attention. I don&#39;t move but I hear him place it on the bedside table at the other side. &#34;Would you like me to zip you&#39;re dress up?&#34; he asks. I can&#39;t reply, I can&#39;t even look at him. I just punched him and he&#39;s acting like nothing happened. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m having a breakdown right now and he&#39;s acting like I&#39;ve done nothing wrong or acting wrong at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bed weighs down and then I feel him start to zip my dress up. I don&#39;t move I just allow him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There,&#34; he says and the bed moves up and I hear a door shut. I look behind me to see the bathroom door shut. Maybe he&#39;s hiding his anger or he&#39;s biding his time. The door opens and he walks out. His hand comes into view. He&#39;s holding his hand out towards me. &#34;C&#39;mon,&#34; he says and I place my hand in his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan leads me into the sitting room and sits on the couch. I sit at the other side so there&#39;s a clear space between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to watch TV, that is until you tell me what just happened,&#34; he says. I look down at my lap and try to calm myself down to then think about what I&#39;m going to say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly look towards Logan to see the cut on his cheek. I look down at my hands to see the costume ring I had bought earlier today from one of the clothes shops we went to. It&#39;s a 3D cross with a pointed bed. It&#39;s now stained with blood. Logan&#39;s blood. I can feel myself starting to get upset, I guess this means I&#39;m the same as Benjamin. My hand even hurts; I had always tried to fight Benjamin off me. I even punched him until my hands hurt but it was like he didn&#39;t feel pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here,&#34; I look to see Logan holding a napkin out to me. I take it and wipe my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I mumble then stay silent. I place the napkin down and take my champagne glass and gulp it down. I take a deep breath and try to calm myself. He&#39;s right I have to explain myself. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I say quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hurting you I never meant to do that, I,&#34; I hold back a sob I don&#39;t want to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me what&#39;s going on in that head, I want to know what you&#39;re thinking,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just had this voice in my head telling my you were the same as him and I wanted it to shut up, to leave me alone but it wouldn&#39;t stop and I don&#39;t know I just started to get angry and I just took it out on you,&#34; I explain and look at him to see him looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouted stop when you pushed me off you,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know if I was talking to you or the voice,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would stop if you ask me to,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I just can&#39;t stop feeling his presence,&#34; I say and he looks down</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I feel him move closer to me and move his hand in mine. I look at him and he leans in to kiss me on the lips. His lips are soft and so is his kiss. I pull away and look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m really sorry,&#34; I say quietly and skim my thumb along his cut cheek bone while I cup his face in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok, I don&#39;t think you intentionally meant to harm me,&#34; he says &#34;But I deserved it anyway after how much of a crap boyfriend I&#39;ve been the past few weeks,&#34; he explains. I sigh and shake my head as he moves his arm around me and pulls me close to him. &#34;I think we can have dessert now,&#34; he says. I nod and watch him reach for chocolate cake that had raspberry coulees and a few raspberries dotted around with icing sugar sprinkled on top. I raise an eyebrow as he places it on his lap. It&#39;s a huge slice with a chocolate middle which I&#39;m guessing is fudge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chocolate fudge?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Devil&#39;s food cake, I love this cake, it&#39;s my favourite,&#34; he says and uses the dessert fork provided to cut off a bite size piece from the cake. He dips a bit of it in the coulees and holds it out to me. &#34;Try it,&#34; he says and I take it in my mouth. &#34;Beautiful isn&#39;t it,&#34; he says and I smile while testing the taste of it. &#34;I love chocolate,&#34; he gushes and I laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re such a girl,&#34; I say and he smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just have a sweet tooth,&#34; he says and reaches for the other dessert and holds it out to me. It&#39;s a lemon cheesecake. I smile and take the plate in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love cheesecake,&#34; I say and cut into the cheesecake. He opens his mouth and I smile &#34;I knew there was a catch to me having a piece of your cake,&#34; I say and place the piece into his mouth. He takes it and smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not as good as my cake,&#34; he says and I laugh. He sits comfortably and looks at the TV. I move closer to him and relax next to him.</p>
