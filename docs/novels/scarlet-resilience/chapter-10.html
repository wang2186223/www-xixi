                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll be ok,&#34; I said to Megan as I held both her hands in front of her &#34;just tell her what you&#39;ve done since you got out of hospital and how you&#39;ve felt. Ok?&#34; I ask . She nodded, still looking down at her feet. &#34;I have to go somewhere but I&#39;ll be back in time to pick you up ok?&#34; she nodded once more and hugged me. I hugged her back and kissed the top of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise you&#39;ll come back?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise,&#34; I said and pulled away. She smiled and looked up at me &#34;don&#39;t be so nervous she&#39;s only there to listen for you to tell her things you feel you can&#39;t tell other people. Ok?&#34; she nodded and walked to the door. I watched her open the door and then shut it quietly behind her. I took a deep breath and walked out of the office and out of the building to my car. I sigh and start the car. It hummed to life once I turned the ignition and I pulled out of my parking spot and drove to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking into her hospital room I felt sudden guilt, I didn&#39;t want to do this but I knew it had to be done. She turned to look at me and I gave her a small smile. Her dark brown hair had been neatly brushed and her light brown eyes lighting up as I sat on her bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you,&#34; I said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, &#34;I love you too,&#34; she paused, &#34;I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re ready now?&#34; she asks. I nodded and looked her in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll never stop loving you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will, just never forget me and how much you have loved me,&#34; she said smiling. &#34;If you cry I&#39;m going to haunt you,&#34; she said smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you do haunt me,&#34; I said smiling. She giggled slightly and I moved down and kissed her on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan don&#39;t be so sad,&#34; she said, pulling away and smiling at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you expect me to feel I&#39;m about to kill my wife unwillingly,&#34; I said looking down at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you&#39;re not, I&#39;m already dead,&#34; she states. I sigh and pressed the nurse button at the side of her bed and looked down at her. &#34;You&#39;re doing the best thing,&#34; she said quietly. A small smile came on my face as I took her hand. &#34;You can move on and I can be at peace. It&#39;s a win, win situation Logan and you will see that,&#34; she states. I nodded slightly as I knew she was right. A nurse walked into the room and looked at us both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you tell the doctor we&#39;re ready for him to turn it off,&#34; I said quietly. I looked at the nurse to see her looking a little shocked &#34;please,&#34; I mumbled. She nodded and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like my coffin by the way,&#34; Stephanie suddenly said. I glared at her, &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be,&#34; I said and kissed her again. &#34;I love how you can be so calm in situations like this,&#34; I said and kissed her again. I pulled back once I heard the door open again, I looked to see the doctor, he gave me a weak smile and then I noticed the nurses stood watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re a nosy lot,&#34; Kate said quietly, I chuckled and hugged her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready,&#34; the silver haired doctor asked as he moved to the bypass machine. I looked at Stephanie and kissed her once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too,&#34; she said and then I saw it. Her eyes filled with tears, I gulped trying to stop myself from crying too. I looked at the doctor and nodded. He took a deep breath and I looked back at her. I leaned in and kissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you,&#34; I said once more and hugged her &#34;and I&#39;ll miss you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll miss you too,&#34; she said faintly. I looked at her as I hugged her and I saw her eyes close and I felt her body go limp in my arms and the only sound in the room was the heart monitor&#39;s flatline tone. I gulped still trying to hold back my tears but it didn&#39;t work. They still spilled slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After several minutes I slowly sat up and moved her hair from her face. She looked so delicate and so peaceful but mostly just beautiful. I leaned forward and pecked her cold lips. I sigh at not feeling her lips move against mine. I stood and watched as the doctor moved the white sheet over her head. I moved my hand to her hand and slowly took her ring off. She had made me promise to take it off and give it to my next love, she read too much about grave robbers to be truthful. I smiled at the memory of when she told me to take it off for her finger. She had read some sort of article in a newspaper at the time about people robbing graves and people who buried a coffin and how they opened it up and took out any jewelry the person was wearing. She didn&#39;t half make me laugh that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wiped my face and turned to see the nurses that had looked after her and that I had gotten to know since she had been in hospital, crying their hearts out. I took a deep breath and walked out of the room expecting them all to have a go at me and instead I was bombarded with hugs and people asking me if I was ok.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you need anything,&#34; one of them said &#34;we&#39;ll happily help you,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine I just need to be on my own,&#34; I said &#34;I hope you all come to her funeral though,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re definitely coming, idiot,&#34; a blonde one snapped. I smiled weakly and slowly started to make my way away from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to be on my own ok?&#34; I ask . They all nodded and gave me one last hug and I made my way out of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once at my car I sat in it quietly, not moving. I clenched my fists and punched the steering wheel and before I knew it I was crying. I growled and started the car. I pulled out of the parking lot and opened up my glove box to take out my tobacco tin. I opened it as I pulled up to some traffic lights and quickly made myself a cigarette with more weed than I would normally have. A lot more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out of my psychologist&#39;s office I looked around the waiting area to see Logan wasn&#39;t here. I frowned and looked at my psychologists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will see you next week Megan,&#34; she said smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O...ok,&#34; I stuttered and looked around again to see a middle aged man walking into the waiting room. I frowned as I recognised him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34;he says. I gave him a confused look &#34;Logan sent me to come and get you,&#34; I frowned again &#34;it&#39;s me Eric I lived opposite you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah,&#34; I mumbled &#34;where&#39;s Loganhe said he was going to be here,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s in jail,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!&#34; I was  shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take you to see him he just told me to come and get you,&#34;he states</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said quietly and I walked slowly behind him out of the waiting room and followed him to his car which was a land rover. I climbed in the back that was when I noticed his wife in the back. I looked at her and she gave me a small smile. I didn&#39;t say anything, I just put on my seat belt and looked down at my lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about ten minutes we were outside the police station. I looked out the window and then looked away. I unbuckle the seatbelt and opened the car door and climbed out. They both looked at me as I walked over to them. I tucked a piece of hair behind my ear as I walked up the path behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once in the police station I followed Lynn who was following a police officer who was taking us to Logan. Eric had gone to sign papers and get him bail. After a minute or so we stood outside a cell. I looked in but couldn&#39;t see him. I frowned and moved in front of them to see he was sat on the floor by the north wall next to the two bunk beds. It was only him in the cell which was different as you normally see on TV shows several men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I said quietly. He looked up and looked straight at me. My expression turned to shock when I saw blood on his eyebrow and his bust lip. I then noticed the cuts and blood on his knuckles. He stood up and walked over to me. I gulped when I smelt the alcohol. How did he get like this within three hours not even that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; Lynn said. I looked at her to see how disappointed she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he getting me out?&#34; he asks her, slurring his words slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; she said, nodding and walking off. He looked at me and then away while shaking his head and walking over to the bed. He sat down on it and rubbed his face and let out a low growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; I ask . His eyes slowly moved towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The other guy is a lot worse,&#34; he practically snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean like that,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I&#39;m not,&#34; he snapped. I looked down at my feet and looked at the police officer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I go in and see him?&#34; I ask . He tilted his head in decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will accidently keep this gate unlocked,&#34;he said and quickly unlocked it and walked off. I smiled and opened the metal bar gate and walked over to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I have a hug?&#34; he asks looking up at me. I nodded and got down on my knees and hugged him. He hugged me back but tighter &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34;he said quietly. I remained silent &#34;he shouldn&#39;t have brought you here for you to see me like this,&#34;he states. I sigh and hug him tighter &#34;I&#39;m not that drunk,&#34;he said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I said &#34;you can walk in a straight line that&#39;s sober enough for me,&#34; I said and silence laced over us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34;he said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah?&#34; I ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it wrong for me to say I want to kiss you right now,&#34; he said and slowly pulled back to look at me. I went to say something but nothing came out, that had taken me by surprise. &#34;Because I do so badly it&#39;s indescribababllle,&#34; I giggled at how he said &#39;indescribable&#39;. He laughs too and rests his forehead against mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not wrong,&#34; I said quietly &#34;but for you to kiss me in a police station that is very risky business,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I have to wait till we are at home?&#34; he asks. I nodded and he smiled &#34;I think I can do that,&#34;he said with a charming smirk and kissed my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I said and stood up. &#34;I have to go back out there,&#34; I said and walked out of the cell and shut it behind me. I turned and looked at him to see he had his head in his hands. I sigh, I was confused. He was okay when he left me and now he&#39;s in a state, he looked like he had been crying and I dread to think how he got all those cuts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; a voice holding authority said walking in. I looked to see it was the guy who had left the cell unlocked. He walked over and pretended to unlock it and then held it open for Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan walked out stumbling a little and then smiled at me. He then followed the police officer out and I followed closely behind. He was a little drunk I had to admit maybe not as much as what he can be but he was drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got out to the reception and they gave Logan his stuff back and told him he had a warning and all this other stuff which I didn&#39;t listen to. I was thinking about what he had said to me, he looked dead serious when</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he said it but I didn&#39;t know whether to take it seriously or not I didn&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking down the path I saw Eric grab Logan by his arm but Logan pushed him away from him and then told him to go away but in a more unpleasant way. I raised my eyebrows slightly and carried on following them. I barely heard Logan ever swear, a couple of times I have heard him say the word &#39;shit&#39; but that isn&#39;t swearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan got in the car in the back and I got in after him. Then Lynn got in the front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take us home,&#34; Logan said, shadowing his eyes but I could tell he had them closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re staying with us tonight,&#34; I heard Eric say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No we&#39;re not. Take us home,&#34; he demanded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would much rather go home,&#34; I said quietly. They sigh and look at me &#34;Sorry,&#34; I said and looked at my lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Eric said, defeated and drove in the direction of mine and Logan&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt Logan take my hand and hold it tightly. I looked at him to see him give me that devilish handsome smirk of his. I gulped and blushed while turning away from him. I had remembered what he had said to me right before I passed out. When he told me he loved me, I didn&#39;t think it was true and it was just because he thought he was going to die, I just didn&#39;t believe it. The worst thing was I couldn&#39;t feel the same way as my love had been used against me and loving someone again seemed impossible for me.</p>
