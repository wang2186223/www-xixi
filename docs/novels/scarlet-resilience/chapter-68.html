                <p>I climb into my bed and move the covers over me and pretend to be asleep. My bedroom door opens and I lay perfectly still as I feel him climb onto my bed and move his arms around me.</p>

                <p>&#34;Do you want me to do anything?&#34; he asks. &#39;Yes castrate yourself&#39; I think to myself but slowly shake my head at him and he looks down a little &#34;we can go see a movie,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t you have a lesson at half two,&#34; I said and he looks down again as if I had just crushed his hopes &#34;but we can watch a movie here,&#34; I said trying to make him feel like he wasn&#39;t useless 2but I&#39;ve seen them all,&#34; I said and look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about we start on dinner you can help me then and then we&#39;ll slow cook it while I&#39;m at work so that when I come back we can put it out and we&#39;ll invite some people round,&#34; he says. I nod a little &#34;you don&#39;t want to,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No it&#39;s not that it&#39;s just who are we going to invite because the only people we can out of my friends in Julie and Yasmin and your friends always look at me weird I don&#39;t think they like me very much,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually we can&#39;t invite Julie because she officially hates me and well they are weird and they don&#39;t hate you why would you think that?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know they&#39;re never around here and like I just figured that might be the reason why,&#34; I said and he sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not it&#39;s because one Carls not talking to James and two I haven&#39;t invited them round and three they don&#39;t always have time they&#39;re always working and as soon as they&#39;re done working they sleep or eat so they never have the energy,&#34; he says. I nod and look down &#34;don&#39;t think that because well they don&#39;t know you and when they do they&#39;ll think you&#39;re amazing like I do,&#34; he said and kisses my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile a little and move my hand to his hand &#34;who gave you this,&#34; I said touching the plaited bracelet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My wife made me it, she was into making bracelets, I&#39;ve actually got some of her old ones that she would wear,2 he said and I look down a little &#34;do you want to see them?&#34; he asks. I shake my head and he sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not that it&#39;s just they&#39;re yours for you to remember your wife by, me seeing them may tarnish those memories,&#34; I explain &#34;and I don&#39;t want to do that,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you wouldn&#39;t,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly Logan I would. I mean I don&#39;t want anyone else touching this necklace of my mother&#39;s but me, Benjamin touched it and because of that I have memories of him with that necklace not letting me see it,&#34; I said and he smiles softly at me &#34;I just want you to keep them as a memory of your wife and nobody else,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand,&#34; he said &#34;thank you,&#34; he said and leans in to kiss me. He pushes forward causing me to go back a little. I move my hands to his chest unbuttoning his shirt a little, I feel one of his hands move under my top. I pull back from the kiss and look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t do this,&#34; I said moving out from under him and move a hand through my hair as I stand and walk out of the room.  He follows me down to the kitchen and sits at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe we should go away for a while,&#34; he says. I look at him and frown &#34;it&#39;s spring break next week maybe we should go away for it try and sort all this out because it&#39;s not helping,&#34; he said and stands and starts to walk towards me. &#34;If you think about it we&#39;ll be able to talk and actually go out together,&#34; he explains and I look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t because people will think there&#39;s something up,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we&#39;ll invite some other people to come with us and said it&#39;s so you can have some fun,&#34; he said and I look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you expect me to spend a week with you when I can&#39;t stand being near you?&#34; I ask and he sighs while looking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but we can get through this and you know that,&#34; he said taking my hands &#34;please and if at any point you want to call it quits we&#39;ll come back and do everything your way,&#34; he said and I sigh and look away from him. He was so forgivable and I could not stay mad at him no matter how hard I tried. I guess I could give it a chance. It may help being away from the city and being able to go out together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said and he smiles a little &#34;we should start on dinner,&#34; I said and he moves closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I have a kiss?&#34; he asks moving his hands to my hips and stroking hip bones with his fingers. I nod and he presses his lips to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I move my arms around his neck as his arms wrap around my body lifting me up a little. He pulls back and I hug him he holds me tightly to him burying his head in my neck. He then pulls back and lets me down to my feet. I look down and turn and he slowly moves his arms around my waist and he rests his head on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are we making?&#34; I ask and he hums.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about Mexican,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I like Mexican we can make burritos and tacos and sauces,&#34; I said with a small smile and he smiles too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; he said &#34;if you can do all that,&#34; he adds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can cook pretty well,&#34; I said and he smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should go shopping or do you want me to do that on my way home?&#34; he asks and I look down remembering how I felt when he hadn&#39;t rang me when I thought he would have and that I will probably forget about him going to the shops. &#34;Megan,&#34; he said catching my attention and look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we should go together,&#34; I said and he nods. &#34;I&#39;ll go get some clothes on,&#34; I said and walk off up to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about ten minutes I walk down the steps to see him sat waiting for me. He stands and turns to look at me. I stood in a pair on jeggings, a long shirt that went past my bum with a brown waist belt around me. He smiles and takes my hand as I walk down the remainder three steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I said as he&#39;s still smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing you just look good,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up,&#34; I said walking past him towards the door. &#34;I haven&#39;t even got make up on how can I look good,&#34; I said to myself but he hears as he laughs and follows me out of the house. &#34;Are we taking the Porsche?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods and I follow him to it. &#34;Wait how are we going to get the shopping into that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The boot Megan and we&#39;re only getting a few bits not a lot,&#34; he said and I nod and walk climb in. I buckle up and he climbs in and reverses out onto the road and then moves his hand into mine. We finally get to the supermarket and he parks the car and takes my hand in his as we walk inside. I frown and look at him. &#34;No one from school is going to be here,&#34; he said and moves his fingers between mine. I had to admit this felt good to be able to walk around holding hands to show people that we&#39;re a couple, that he was mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the feeling was lost when he suddenly lets go. He starts to quicken his pace and walk in front of me. I frown and catch up. He picks up a basket and pretty much storms down one of the isles. Ok did he have a fear of the supermarket or something because at this moment he looked like he couldn&#39;t wait to get out of here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan?&#34; I snap getting his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry saw one of the teachers on the way out of here but he&#39;s gone now so...&#34; he trails off and walks towards me and moves a hand into mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A history teacher, he must have been on the lunch run they take it in turns but yeah,&#34; he said and holds my hand gently and the feeling returns. I smile and we walk around the supermarket holding hands and for the first time in a while I feel like we were actually a couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulls me close and kisses the top of my head as I read the back of a chilli sauce jar. He has his right arm around my waist while his left holds the basket with food in. His right hand moves from my right hip down to my bum and I look at him, he smiles at me and I roll my eyes at him and continue reading what&#39;s in the jar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok we&#39;ll get this one as well,&#34; I said and he holds the basket up to me. I place the jar in the basket and look at what we&#39;ve got already. &#34;All we need now is some tortilla chips,&#34; I said &#34;you go get in line and I&#39;ll get them,&#34; I said and walk off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk to the isle the chips are on and take three different kinds and then walk towards the tills. I stop when I see him talking to a brunette woman. She&#39;s smaller than me but wearing heels which makes her look taller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk towards them slowly and I feel jealousy rise in me like never before. I&#39;ve never gotten jealous over some girl from just looking at her but right at this moment I wanted to rip the girls face off. She touches his arm and he folds them, moving them away from her grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I have a girlfriend,&#34; he said, causing her to pout at him. I frown and walk towards them and put the chips on the conveyor belt. Logan looks at me and smiles while moving towards me pulling me into a kiss. He then hugs me tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is she?&#34; I ask in his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no idea,&#34; he said and moves his arm around me &#34;meet my girlfriend,&#34; he said and she gives me a fake smile and turns to watch the checkout girl scan her items. I smile to myself a little bit and he kisses the top of my head. &#34;What a bitch,&#34; he mutters and I laugh at him while playing with his loosened tie.</p>
