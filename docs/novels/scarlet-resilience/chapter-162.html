                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know how you can just have casual sex with anyone, the first time with Tyler I regretted it,&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;Boredom more than anything, most of the time I&#39;m sitting by the pool at home and he sends me a text, and I just think, &#39;why not, nothing else to do today,&#39; so I tell him to come round,&#34; she explains. I chuckle and take another drag. &#34;He&#39;s so bad at oral,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, he is,&#34; I say, and she laughs. &#34;I think that&#39;s why he doesn&#39;t do it often,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he&#39;s thrilled to have it done to him,&#34; she says, making me laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope, if he doesn&#39;t do it to me, I don&#39;t do it to him,&#34; I say with a shake of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should probably take that attitude,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t even fake it with him; I just stay silent,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s brutal,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How else is he going to get better?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I fake it about 90% of the time,&#34; she says and looks towards Sandra. &#34;What do you think?&#34; she asks her. She shrugs and looks away from us. I can tell she&#39;s not happy right now. &#34;What&#39;s Logan like?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An expert,&#34; I then slap my hand to my mouth and look at her. She grins and then laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew it,&#34; she says, laughing. I shove her, and she just laughs harder. &#34;Calm down; your secret is safe with me,&#34; she says. I look at Sandra, and she shakes her head before walking out. I jump down from the ledge and look at Courtney.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe you tricked me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? I could always get you to spill,&#34; she says with a smile still on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You promise not to say anything?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise,&#34; she says and holds her little finger out to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, teasing either, he cannot know you know,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; she says with a sigh. &#34;I will keep my mouth shut,&#34; she says and hooks her pinky finger with mine just like we used to do when we were younger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should probably go to class,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;1st class is English too,&#34; she says with a grin, and we both walk out. Logan will probably know I&#39;m high the moment he looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both walk into his classroom to see him sitting at his desk, texting on his phone. Courtney greets him, and without looking away from his phone, he greets her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How was your weekend, sir?&#34; she asks. He looks up from his phone and then frowns at us both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; he says and watches as Courtney, and I sit at the back. &#34;Since when were you two friends?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Melanie says, frowning at me. &#34;What the hell?&#34; she mouths. I sigh and then look at Courtney.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We bonded over notes,&#34; she says, and I chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Sandra walks in and goes to Logan and whispers something to him. He looks at me then at Courtney. The class fills up. I gulp as he glares at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Outside,&#34; he snaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit,&#34; I whisper and get up from my seat. I pick up my bag and weave my way around the desks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You too,&#34; he snaps at Courtney. She follows me outside; Sandra follows and then stands watching us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not cool Sandra,&#34; I say, and she laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only following orders,&#34; she clarifies, and we wait for Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s pissed,&#34; Courtney states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yep,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s hot when he&#39;s angry,&#34; I look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always think he&#39;s hot,&#34; she laughs and leans against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan walks out of the classroom. He tells Sandra to go back into the classroom to make sure everyone is doing what he had told them to do. He&#39;s looking just as good as ever. All he&#39;s wearing is jeans and a t-shirt but the way they pull and tighten around his muscles. Courtney is right. He folds his arms, making his white t-shirt tighten around his biceps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widen as I realise weed makes me horny or just Logan does.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See,&#34; Courtney says in my ear and gives me a nudge. I look at her out of my side view and then shake my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re both high,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I usually am nowadays,&#34; Courtney says. &#34;You never usually notice,&#34; she states and gives Sandra the side-eye as if Sandra was still standing here. &#34;Me being high doesn&#39;t affect you in any way, so just let me back in the class, and everything will be fine,&#34; she says, and he glares at her and then sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go inside,&#34; he orders her. She smiles and walks back into the class, but not before giving me a little wink. Logan turns to me, and I quickly look away. I hate and love being alone with him. Usually, whenever he&#39;s alone or doesn&#39;t know I&#39;m in the room, I watch him. &#34;I don&#39;t know what to do anymore,&#34; he says. &#34;I&#39;ve tried everything to forget you,&#34; I look at him. He moves his hand through his hair and walks to the empty classroom opposite. He opens the door and looks at me to follow. I do. He leans against the desk, and I shut the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re so angry at me; I wish I knew. What I do know is that this isn&#39;t good for either one of us. Every time I see you I want to talk to you, I want to take you in my arms and tell you that whatever it is your feeling I can help you. Which is pathetic, I know. But for some stupid reason, I can&#39;t stay angry at you, even now when you&#39;re stood there stinking of weed with a love bite on your neck. I can&#39;t be angry. I know you hate me and if I could move out I would, but I&#39;ll be gone in two months. So all I&#39;m asking of you is, can we be civil to each other for these two months and then I&#39;ll be out of your life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clench my hands into a fist as I feel myself become angrier. He&#39;s leaving. I knew he was but hearing him tell me now is heartbreaking. Before all of this, I was going with him, and I&#39;m pretty sure we had it planned for the end of August due to me having to do summer school. I can&#39;t even picture my life without him in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did this have to happen? This is why I didn&#39;t want to love anyone; in the end, I&#39;ve gotten hurt anyway. I want to scream at him, tell him he&#39;s done this to me, but I know the truth. He hasn&#39;t done anything; I did this. It&#39;s me I&#39;m angry at, and it&#39;s me I hate. I could never hate him no matter how much I&#39;ve tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel his hand on my cheek. I hadn&#39;t noticed him move; his thumb wipes under my eyes. I look up at him, and he&#39;s so close to me. I don&#39;t have it in me to push him away. I&#39;m so tired of trying to hurt him. He leans close to me, his lips lightly touch mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t leave,&#34; I whisper, &#34;Please,&#34; I beg and his lips press against mine. He pushes me against the door, and I can&#39;t help but kiss him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This kiss isn&#39;t like last time; it&#39;s slow and holds so much more emotions. Before he was angry and frustrated with me, this time he is expressing how he really feels about me and I don&#39;t like it. He&#39;s kissing me like this is the last time. Like he won&#39;t ever kiss me again. I should be pleased with the thought, but all it does is upset me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands move down from my face even as I feel myself cry more. He presses his body against mine, and I feel all of him. I pull away as his hand moves through my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it,&#34; I cry. He kisses the top of my head and makes me look back up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me what you want,&#34; I shake my head as I feel everything I&#39;ve been feeling these past few weeks came rushing through me. &#34;Stop crying,&#34; he says quietly and kisses me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop kissing me like this,&#34; I say against his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like it&#39;s the last time,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it?&#34; he asks, &#34;you told me you don&#39;t want me,&#34; he says. I shake my head and push him away from me. I need to leave. I open the door and walk out, he walks out after me and grabs me by my arm to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right,&#34; I say, looking at him. His grip loosens. &#34;I&#39;m being stupid,&#34; I say and get myself out of his grasp and then run down the hall away from him. I hear him hit the lockers, but I don&#39;t stop. I need to getaway.</p>
