                <p>The car drives up a long gravel drive. I sit up a little resting my hand on Logan&#39;s leg and leaning over him to look out the window. The house we&#39;re heading to doesn&#39;t even look like a house; it&#39;s more of a massive mansion that could probably fit another mansion inside. It looked like something out of a historical movie with it&#39;s pillars and long windows and what seemed like a balcony that ran around the middle of the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the limo pulls up to the steps of the house I see people standing outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; Logan said, catching my attention. I look at him and he moves his hands to my hands and lift me off him. &#34;Thank you,&#34; he said and gets out of the car. He holds his hand out for me and I take it. Then Melanie and the others get out after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meg-chan,&#34; Melanie whispers. I raise my eyebrows just because it&#39;s been a while since she&#39;s called me that &#34;your boyfriend is rich,&#34; she said and a small smile appears on her face. I feel Logan let go of my hand, I look to see him walking to a pregnant woman in a maids uniform. She has dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. She seems to be in her late twenties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you working?&#34; he asks her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan, I&#39;m fine,&#34; she said, trying to reassure him. &#34;I&#39;m only five months jeez you act like I&#39;m about to pop,&#34; she said and rolled her eyes. He shakes his head and then looks towards us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suggest you all go pick a bedroom, the ones that are unlocked are the ones you can go in,&#34; he said &#34;I&#39;d run because Carl knows the good ones,&#34; he said and Carl runs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sleeping next to Logan&#39;s room,&#34; he calls as he runs up the steps into the house. They all run after him. I sigh and shake my head as I walk up the stairs, I&#39;m too tired to even bother running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel Logan&#39;s arms go around my waist stopping me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To get a bedroom,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh ok if that&#39;s how it is,&#34; he said, pouting and taking his arms from around me. He follows me into the mansion and I stop at the grand staircase. I look up at the ceiling and then around to see doors open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean &#39;if that&#39;s how it is&#39;?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you&#39;d want to sleep in my bed with me,&#34; he says. I then watch the people that were stood outside walk into the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Peters,&#34; I hear Julie shout. She runs out from the right side of the staircase and looks at us &#34;Carl won&#39;t leave my bedroom,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said she could share the bed with me, I don&#39;t bite unless she wants me to,&#34; Carl said standing next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please you couldn&#39;t satisfy me even if you tried,&#34; she said folding her arms and turning away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t just satisfy you honey, I&#39;d have you,&#34; Logan cuts him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl,&#34; he snaps. Carl sighs and folds his arms &#34;Which room is it?&#34; he asks taking his jacket off. He hands his jacket to the man in the butler suit and then takes my hand in his and pulls me with him up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The one next to yours, the one I called,&#34; Carl said pouting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t call dibs,&#34; Julie says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s very true,&#34; Logan says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, I have that room all the time,&#34; Carl whines. I smile a little as I walk with Logan to his room. He reaches up to the door frame and takes a key. He unlocks the door and walks in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell you what, why don&#39;t you both go play a game and whoever wins gets the room,&#34; Logan says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it makes more sense for me to have the room when that&#39;s the only room left unless you want me to share with one of your students,&#34; Carl said &#34;and if that&#39;s the case I choose sharing with Yasmin,&#34; he said with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;s the case Julie you have to go share with someone,&#34; Logan explains and takes off his t-shirt. He then turns to them and pushes them out. &#34;Now leave, go sleep,&#34; he said and shuts the door on them and locks it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look around his room to see it was pretty neutral. White walls, royal blue carpet matching drapes and bedding. It&#39;s quite a simple looking room with an air of elegance to it. I think that was due to the four poster bed that stood in the middle of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan yawning stops me from looking around his room. He undo&#39;s his jeans and then gets in his bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you not going to go to sleep?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll try,&#34; I said and I watch him turn and watch me. I take off my jacket and then pull down my bottoms. He pulls back the covers and I get in and moves the covers over myself. Logan moves his arms around me and I turn to face him. &#34;Wouldn&#39;t it be best for us to go to sleep later so that we wake up in the morning rather than the early hours?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes but if I don&#39;t go to sleep now I&#39;ll drop dead,&#34; Logan said and I smile at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok you get your beauty sleep,&#34; I said moving my fingers through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you don&#39;t need beauty sleep but you do need to sleep,&#34; he said with his eyes closed. I smile and rest my head on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I groan and I tap his chest. There&#39;s music playing really loud and that is what has caused me to wake up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; he said and I feel him get up. &#34;Back in a minute,&#34; he said and I turn away from him, burying my head into the pillow. What feels about five seconds I hear the music stop and then about ten seconds later I feel</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan&#39;s arm back around me. &#34;It&#39;s nearly half twelve,&#34; he said in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said, keeping my eyes closed. I feel his hand move from my waist to my bum and then him kiss my shoulder. I turn my head to look at him. I watch him get comfy and then look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi,&#34; he says. I smile and turn to look away from him. He continues to kiss my shoulder and down my arm as his hand squeezes my bum a little. I turn fully, his hand resting perfectly on my bum. I close my eyes and I can feel him watching me as I try to go back to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about ten minutes I&#39;m at the type of sleep where I can sort of hear what&#39;s going on around me but I&#39;m still asleep. I hear our bedroom door open and then footsteps. I stir a little and then feel the covers get pulled from over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan you cheeky boy,&#34; I hear Carls voice say. I sit up and rub my eyes &#34;Copping a feel while she&#39;s asleep,&#34; he said and I yawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl go away,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you both need to get up, it&#39;s late you&#39;ve spent half the day in bed and not even in a good way,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan sighs and gets up. He reaches for his duvet and lays it on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s right,&#34; he said looking at me. &#34;That we should get up,&#34; he adds on &#34;We don&#39;t have to unpack that&#39;s done for us,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s unfair, why didn&#39;t they unpack ours?&#34; Carl whines and lays on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you&#39;re not their boss and they all hate you, I&#39;m not surprised if they&#39;ve hidden your suitcase,&#34; he said and then stood up and walked round the bed. &#34;I&#39;m going for a shower, no harassing my girlfriend Carl,&#34; he said, causing me to smile and look at Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning Poppet,&#34; Carl said looking at me and smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Afternoon,&#34; I said, smiling and moving the covers over my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think Yasmin is a good girl or a naughty girl?&#34; he asks. I frown at him &#34;I&#39;ve got a feeling she&#39;s a naughty girl,&#34; he said to himself and then looks back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you asking me this?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I got my eye on her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pervert,&#34; I said, getting comfy and hugging a pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not watching her, I just think she&#39;s hot,&#34; he pauses. &#34;plus I&#39;m a bit horny and I saw her come down the stairs earlier and she&#39;s got quite the body,&#34; he pauses &#34;wait how old is she?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s 18,&#34; I say. &#34;She&#39;s not a virgin,&#34; I said. He looks at me &#34;she&#39;s slept with I think two people,&#34; I said and he looks at me and smirks. &#34;But she&#39;s not interested,&#34; I said &#34;and Logan would probably kill you,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True but it would be worth it,&#34; he says. &#34;I mean that body, I&#39;d ruin it,&#34; he said and I laugh. &#34;I&#39;m serious, I&#39;d go all out and destroy,&#34; he said and I laughed harder. &#34;She won&#39;t be able to walk once I&#39;m done with her,&#34; he said and I went into a fit of laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god Carl, you&#39;re something else,&#34; I said trying to calm myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is what she will be saying,&#34; causing me to laugh again. I get out of bed and stretch. &#34;I&#39;d do the same to you though,&#34; he says. I look at him and he smiles, I shake my head at him &#34;but I&#39;d take care with you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks nice to know,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it is cause let&#39;s face it you and I both know I&#39;m better than Logan,&#34; he said and I realised he&#39;s not joking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks away and I look around the room to see my suitcase propped up against the wall next to the door no one had entered or exited in since I have been here. I open it and see my clothes and Logans clothes hung up and folded neatly inside. On the left Logan&#39;s clothes, and on the right mine. I walk in and look around and find a pair of bottoms I had packed.</p>
