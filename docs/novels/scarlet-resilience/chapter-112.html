                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it&#39;s big then?&#34; Julie asks, looking at me. She had come rushing into my room after Logan left. Apparently she found it super sweet of him to come and see if she&#39;s ok. She had walked in on me telling Yasmin and Melanie that we did go further than a kiss and, Julie being Julie, she demanded details. I could get away without telling them the details if Julie wasn&#39;t here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bigger than I expected,&#34; I say quietly and Yasmin laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean because it&#39;s bigger than Tylers,&#34; Julie says and I roll my eyes as they all start laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I guess,&#34; I say with a slight giggle and they just laugh at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aww you&#39;ve gone all red,&#34; Yasmin says and I just look away from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think you&#39;ll both have sex now?&#34; Melanie asks and I shrug and play with a piece of thread that has come loose from the bottom of my jeans. &#34;Do you want to?&#34; Melanie asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, he&#39;s already told me that we wouldn&#39;t be having sex anyway until I&#39;ve left school,&#34; I explain and they nod in understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a long time,&#34; Yasmin says and I nod. I know that is a long time and I already have a feeling that I&#39;d be ready for sex soon, just because of how much Logan makes me feel. I trust him and I know it won&#39;t be long until I trust him completely with my body. &#34;Do you think you&#39;ll both last that long?&#34; she asks and I frown at her &#34;I&#39;m asking because it will be difficult for him and yourself to not want to take things further,&#34; Yasmin explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Plus he&#39;s cheated on you once already so there&#39;s not much hope,&#34; Melanie says and Yasmin looks at her, her jaw opening wide. &#34;What?&#34; Melanie asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t say that,&#34; she explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s right,&#34; I say quietly and look away from them &#34;I have thought that will happen again and I don&#39;t know I feel that if he does do it again I don&#39;t want to know, I&#39;d rather not know,&#34; I say and Yasmin and Melanie both frown at me. &#34;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to handle news like that again,&#34; I inform and stand up. &#34;C&#39;mon this conversation is depressing,&#34; I say and start walking out of my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dump her,&#34; My uncle snaps at me as I carry on running on the treadmill. I look away from him &#34;I don&#39;t understand how you cannot see that this is the best thing to do,&#34; he states. He reaches over to the treadmill and presses the button to make it faster. I look at him and he smiles &#34;The longer you ignore me the faster this will go,&#34; he states. I just look straight ahead out of the floor to ceiling windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The speed gets faster and I run as fast as I can, I try not to concentrate on how fast I&#39;m going as long as I keep going. What he needs to understand is that I can&#39;t dump her not after what we&#39;ve been through and with how much I love her. He&#39;s wrong to say that our relationship won&#39;t work because of my past and because of hers. Just because they need me here next year doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t be with her, I have the money to be with her, I can travel back and forth to America every weekend, when she has holidays at school she can come here to see me, we can make long distance work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>THe treadmill is going too fast for me to keep up, I reach for the emergency stop magnet and pull on the string attached to it to make it stop. I move off the treadmill and reach for my towel as I try to get my breath back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can do long distance,&#34; I say and he laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah because she trusts you that much,&#34; he says and I just glare at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just leave it alone, she and I are together and we&#39;re staying together, I will not go back to my old ways and we&#39;re not bad for each other,&#34; I pause and wipe my face with the towel &#34;yes we have our own problems but that does not mean we aren&#39;t ready fro each other,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine how about this you have 24 hours or I expose to her just how evil you can be, then we&#39;ll see how much she wants to be with you,&#34; he retorts and starts to walk away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you,&#34; I bristle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have the police reports that never went official and well the pictures of all the people you have nearly killed, all with your own hands,&#34; he explains &#34;the girl really needs to know that the man she&#39;s planning on spending her life with is more violent than her own father,&#34; he states and that statement hits me like a ton of bricks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body feels heavy as his statement lingers in my mind. I can&#39;t have him tell her, she&#39;ll never speak to me again, she&#39;ll be scared of me and I cannot risk that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I call as I walk towards the gym. He has been in here for hours. Everyone is getting ready for the party that is been thrown. I walk into the gym to see him punching a punching bag. I stand watching him for a few seconds before I decide to interrupt him. It&#39;s then I see that he has earphones in. &#34;Logan,&#34; I say loudly and he stops and looks at me. He gives me a small smile and takes out his earphones. &#34;Everyone is getting ready for the party tonight, don&#39;t you think you should start?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah sure, I&#39;ll be up in a minute, I&#39;m just letting out some frustration,&#34; he says and puts his earphones back in. I could watch him work out all day, he is quite the image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is no wonder he attracts so many women every time he&#39;s out, his sapphire blue eyes look so gentle and soft and his contrasting dark hair is a silk dark brown. I wonder if what we plan to do is going to work out. He must be sexually frustrated already afterall he was a massive player and he has slept with lots of women. I do have the fear that I am not enough for him even if we were sleeping together, I don&#39;t truly believe that I am enough and I know that is more my own problem than his. Yes he cheated on me but what did I expect after I did tell him it was ok to sleep around. My own insecurities did this, I am as much to blame as he is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out of the gym I bump into David, He gives me a small smile and walks past me into the gym shutting the door behind him. I frown a little their chats seem to be very secret. I shrug it off and walk back up to my room to get ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decide on some simple navy washed skinny jeans and a tight vest top. I feel a little confident in wearing this, maybe it&#39;s because I know that the people that are coming don&#39;t know me, they don&#39;t know what I&#39;ve been through. That gives me some comfort as it means they won&#39;t be looking for any signs of harm like the people at school do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opens and I look to see Logan, I give him a small smile. He looks me up and down and then walks towards me and kisses me hard on the lips. I smile a little and move my hands to his shoulders. He&#39;s all sweaty but I don&#39;t mind it, he doesn&#39;t smell funky so it&#39;s all good. I pull away from him and look him in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything ok?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, you just look hot so I had to kiss you,&#34; he answers, I smile and move onto my tip toes to kiss him. His hands snake around my waist and he presses himself to my body. He seems a little off, it&#39;s almost like he&#39;s holding onto me for dear life. I pull away again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go get a shower,&#34; I say moving back onto my feet. &#34;You don&#39;t have long and we can&#39;t stay up here they&#39;ll think we&#39;re being naughty,&#34; I grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care,&#34; he replies and leans in to kiss me. I turn my head giving him the cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go get showered,&#34; I say giving him my sternest of looks. He smiles and takes his hands from around me to walk into the bathroom. I smile to myself and start on my hair, I decide on putting waves in it with the flat irons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan doesn&#39;t take long in the shower. He&#39;s out after ten minutes and now he&#39;s nearly dressed. He&#39;s sat on the edge of the bed fiddling with his phone. I put down the flat irons and look at myself in the mirror, my hair was good enough. I turn them off and then turn to him only to see he&#39;s deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; I ask while walking towards him. I stand in front of him and he looks up at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to talk to you,&#34; he says and I frown at him. The last time he needed to talk to me was to tell me he had cheated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to know,&#34; I say and I can feel my eyes welling with water, &#34;I don&#39;t want to know this time, in fact I don&#39;t want to know any other times, if you&#39;re going to cheat just keep it to yourself, I can&#39;t go through that again,&#34; I say and move my hands out of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? No it&#39;s not that,&#34; he hastens to say, standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what is it because every time you start a conversation like that you tell me something bad and I don&#39;t want to know,&#34; I say and I can feel myself on the verge of bursting into tears. I step away from him and try to blink back the tears. He looks down at the floor and moves his hand in his jeans pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is for the best,&#34; he says looking at me and my frown deepens. He takes a deep breath and looks away from me. &#34;I think we should break up.&#34;</p>
