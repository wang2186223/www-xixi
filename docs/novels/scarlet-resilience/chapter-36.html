                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes opened and straight away I looked at Megan&#39;s bed. It was empty. I sat up and was about to call her name when I heard the shower. Then I heard her crying. I frowned and slowly looked into the bathroom to see she was naked. I quickly looked away and leaned against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re there,&#34; I heard her say. I frowned, confused, &#34;you stopped snoring,&#34; I frowned, how the hell do I snore? I ask myself, I&#39;m a quiet sleeper. &#34;You don&#39;t usually snore, which is weird,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you crying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t understand why even if I told you,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try me,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just leave it,&#34; she snapped, &#34;and go back to sleep or something,&#34; I sigh and sit down on her bed waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I looked up when I heard tapping. I looked to see her hand wafting at the bedroom door and then she finally reached it. The door swung shut making a loud bang and I looked down at the floor while rubbing my eyes. Maybe I was taking on too much with her, trying to get her to forget but it was obvious she wasn&#39;t going to and I knew she wouldn&#39;t forget completely. I just want her to feel better again and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m helping her in doing that. I seem to be causing her more trouble than it&#39;s worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and look at the bathroom door as it is unlocked. She had only been in the shower for five minutes. She walked out of the bathroom and her eyes landed on me straight away. She sighs and walks into her walk-in wardrobe. The look she gave me when she came out of there told me exactly how she felt about me, she obviously disliked me so much that seeing me annoyed her. I have tried everything I can to let her see that everything is ok now, but it hasn&#39;t worked because I&#39;m not the one to do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry I didn&#39;t come home at the right time last night,&#34; I hear her say. I looked up at her to see her standing in the doorway now dressed. I sigh and look down. She walked over to me and stood in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would I not understand why you were crying?&#34; I asked  and looked up at her. My eyes widened, she was still crying. I slowly took her hand and she sighs and looks down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll explain it,&#34; she said and closed her eyes while taking a deep breath. &#34;I&#39;m confused,&#34; she states and then looked at me &#34;Everyday I feel the need to be touched,&#34; she said and looked down &#34;not me personally it&#39;s more my body, I don&#39;t understand it myself and I hate it because I don&#39;t want to feel like that and my mind just seems to remember things and I hate it,&#34; she cried. &#34;And for me to silence this feeling I do stupid things and I know I shouldn&#39;t but it seems the only way to stop it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This has been going on for a while?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; she nodded and took her hand out of mine &#34;it makes me feel dirty because of it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not dirty and well I do understand,&#34; I state. She looked at me, &#34;It&#39;s happening because your body is so used to being touched everyday by the jackass that now it&#39;s suddenly stopped it&#39;s craving it,&#34; I explained. She frowned &#34;basically your body is a bit addicted to sex,&#34; I said with a small smirk. She folded her arms across her chest and looked away from me. &#34;Sorry,&#34; I said, &#34;I&#39;m a guy,&#34; she raised an eyebrow and looked at me &#34;yes that&#39;s my excuse and I&#39;m sticking to it,&#34; I then noticed bruising on her upper arm. She covered them with her hand and looked at me &#34;who did...&#34; I trailed off when last night recapped me. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I said quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked down, &#34;It&#39;s ok I hardly remember anything anyway so it doesn&#39;t matter,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still I shouldn&#39;t have dragged you like I did, I was angry and a bit jealous but still,&#34; he states &#34;none of that is an excuse for hurting you, I&#39;m sorry&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing Logan,&#34; she said with a small smile. I frowned while looking at her &#34;Sorry it&#39;s just weird to hear someone say sorry to me for once. Benjamin never said sorry for anything, he always had a reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;m about a whole universe from Benjamin,&#34; I state and move my hands into her hands &#34;what do you want to do about this feeling?&#34; I ask .  She shrugged, &#34;What have you been doing about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drinking, self harming and whatever I did last night,&#34; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well there&#39;s the easy solution but you don&#39;t want to do that,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the easy solution?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Satisfy the craving,&#34; I state. She sighs and then looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean...&#34; I nodded and she blushed a little &#34;well who am I going to do that with?&#34; I raised an eyebrow and shrugged. She sighs &#34;Sex does....did mean something to me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to have sex,&#34; both her eyebrows rose &#34;and you don&#39;t need to do any of that either, there is therapy,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh great, more therapy that&#39;s just what I need,&#34; she states. I sigh and pull her closer to me and let her sit on my knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Therapy isn&#39;t all bad you know, I&#39;ve had so much of it, it&#39;s like my own personal addiction and best friend,&#34; I said with a small smile and looked at her. &#34;But you never know it may work,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighs and looks down and within a second I felt her lips on mine. I slowly kissed her back and pulled her closer to me. She moved on top of me and I slowly moved my hands to her thighs. Then she pulled back and looked down then hugged me. I hugged her back and kissed her shoulder and slowly kissed up her neck. She slowly kissed me on the lips. Her hands moved to my t-shirt and she started to tug at it. I pulled back and stroked her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You took me by surprise,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; she mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be,&#34; I said and kissed her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you stay with me,&#34; she asks.  I frowned &#34;I like this,&#34; she states &#34;I more than like this, I don&#39;t really know how to explain it. It&#39;s just when you&#39;re with me I feel everything I should feel and I really like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good because I was starting to get doubts,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doubts about what?&#34; she asks, moving her hands around my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On whether I was being useful and helpful to you,&#34; I explained. She chuckled and shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you get any cuter?&#34; she asked herself and gave me a quick kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cute,&#34; I said &#34;I hate being called cute it&#39;s not me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh it is,&#34; she said and then we heard scratching at the door and then barking. I sigh and laid back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He ruins everything that dog does,&#34; I say. She smiled a little and then giggled and leaned in to kiss me. Then the door swung open and Max ran in. She quickly pulled back and we both looked to see Carl standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; he said with a small smirk and shut the door. She looked down at me and then giggled and I sat up when I felt Max jump on the bed. I turned to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate you,&#34; I growled. He just barked at me and I moved my hands through her hair and pulled her down into a kiss and rolled her over so I was on top and then moved my hands around her waist and up her top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened again. &#34;I&#39;m sorry to interrupt but Megan your grandfather is here,&#34; Carl said. I pulled away as soon as he walked in. She got up and walked out of the room and I stood there as Carl folded his arms and smirked at me. &#34;Arsehole,&#34; he huffed and walked out. I frowned and walked out after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cheating on me with a girl of all things,&#34; he said folding his arms and doing a dramatic huff. I chuckled at him and walked down the stairs with him. I walked outside to see a black Bentley. My eyes widened and I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>slowly walked towards the beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; she snapped at her grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s an apology,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apology accepted,&#34; I said, smiling at the excellence that was a Bentley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want it,&#34; she said, folding her arms and looking away from her grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t like the colour I can get you a different colour,&#34; he suggested. She growled and walked back into the house. &#34;Hmm maybe I should have gotten you the Rolls Royce or the Lamborghini,&#34; he said to himself and walked into the house with her. I ran back in towards the living room to see him sitting on the couch sighing slightly. I walked into the kitchen to see her standing at the sink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; I ask . She shook her head &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not because of you,&#34; she said, turning to look at me. &#34;I have the biggest headache and a pain in    the arse in the living room,&#34; she said, folding her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s trying to say sorry to you,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just want me to accept the Bentley,&#34; she states. I smirked and then sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But still he&#39;s trying at least give him a chance, and I know you think he&#39;s just trying to buy you off but it&#39;s all he&#39;s known since all he&#39;s had is money,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No he did work for the money he&#39;s got but I&#39;m not a person he should feel he has to buy off,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s true and you should tell him that,&#34; she looked at me raising her eyebrow &#34;you should start to tell people what you&#39;re thinking even if it&#39;s something personal about them,&#34; I state. She smirked, &#34;I mean it,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re too nice to people, tell people what you think,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; she said and walked back into the living room. I sigh and walk into the living room to see her sitting down opposite her grandfather. She held the car keys in her hands twiddling with them while sighing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t want the car it&#39;s fine I can take it back,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned back and laid the keys on her barely there stomach. &#34;You can&#39;t buy me you know,&#34; she states. He nodded and was about to say something else when she spoke first &#34;I&#39;m not going to take the car right now,&#34; she states. I huffed and folded my arms, &#34;I will take it when you think I have earned it,&#34; she states, causing my eyebrows to rise as she placed the keys in front of him. &#34;If what Logan tells you over the next three months is good and you&#39;re happy with it then give me the car not now,&#34; she explained and stood up. &#34;I&#39;m off back to bed,&#34; she sighs and walks out of the room.</p>
