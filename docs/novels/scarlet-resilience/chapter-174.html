                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body feels numb, Courtney has pretty much shoved as much alcohol as she possibly can down me. Chloe is just as drunk as Courtney. I try to get up from the sofa I&#39;m seated on, but I fail. Closing my eyes and leaning my head back, the room feels like it&#39;s spinning. I open my eyes and try to focus before I throw up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally getting myself out of the sofa, I go in search of Courtney. I want to go home. Staggering into the kitchen, I see her sitting on some guy&#39;s lap, and she looks like she could pass out at any minute. I frown and look around to see Chloe is in the same predicament. I sober up a little over the danger they&#39;ve both put themselves in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk over and take Courtney from the guy. He frowns at me and stands up towering over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Courtney, we&#39;re going home,&#34; I say to her. She nods a little and leans on to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t feel too good,&#34; she slurs at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck,&#34; the guy says as he squares up to me. I stagger back a little and look at Chloe. I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;m going to get both of them out of here on my own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, we&#39;re leaving,&#34; I snap. I wish I hadn&#39;t snuck out of the house now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t want to leave,&#34; he says and takes her from me. Courtney pushes his hands from her and tries to come to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The music suddenly stops, and Logan walks over to us. He takes Courtney from the guy and punches him. My eyes widen as the guy is flat out on the floor. He then looks at Chloe. The guy holding her takes his hands from her and holds them up in surrender. He picks Chloe up, and I take Courtney.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I follow Logan out of the house. Once outside, I hear the music turn back on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; I say to Logan. He nods and walks towards a car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He puts Chloe into the front seat and then helps me get Courtney into the back seat. Closing the door, I get in on the other side, and Logan gets in next to me so that I&#39;m sitting between him and Courtney. It&#39;s then I notice David at the wheel. He gives me a small smile before starting the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you doing here? Megan,&#34; Logan asks after a couple of minutes driving. I open my eyes and look at him to see he&#39;s very stoned right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Courtney wanted me to come,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah and look what fucking happened, you&#39;re hammered,&#34; I sigh and close my eyes again, and I can feel the world spinning. Suddenly nausea runs through my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m gonna throw up,&#34; I say. The car comes to a stop, Logan gets out and pulls me out with him. I get to the closest bush and throw up the contents of my stomach. Logan holds my hair back; I thank him in between heaving my guts out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I stop dry heaving, he helps me back to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See,&#34; he snaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just take me home,&#34; I say and lay my head on Courtney&#39;s shoulder. She doesn&#39;t stir, which makes me think she&#39;s either really drunk or her drink has been spiked. I sit up and check on her to see she&#39;s breathing. &#34;Is she going to be ok?&#34; I ask either one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks like they&#39;ve passed out,&#34; Logan states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can see that,&#34; I snap at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really, you do? Do you also see this could have been you right now?&#34; he argues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up,&#34; I then turn to David, &#34;David, will they be ok?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, don&#39;t worry about them, I&#39;ll make sure they&#39;re ok,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive back is silent. Logan is sitting next to me, stewing in his own anger, and I&#39;m pretty sure I fell asleep at one point. Logan and David had taken both Chloe and Courtney up to a guest bedroom, leaving me in the kitchen. I make myself a glass of water. I quickly rinse my mouth out and then fill my glass up again to down the contents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel like crap. Can you get a hangover while drunk?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you feeling any better?&#34; David asks me. I look up from laying my head on the counter to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I say and reach for my glass again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should go to bed,&#34; he says. I nod in agreement, but I don&#39;t move from my spot on my stool. &#34;C&#39;mon,&#34; he says and helps me off the chair. &#34;How you got yourself in this state is beyond me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t act like you have never been drunk, David,&#34; I slur and hiccup as he lifts my feet off the ground and carries me upstairs. &#34;I bet you&#39;re a fun drunk,&#34; I say, wrapping my arms around his neck and laying my head on his shoulder. &#34;Where&#39;s Logan?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably screwing Chloe,&#34; I mutter. He sighs as he carries me upstairs. &#34;I hate this,&#34; and I feel myself start to get upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So do I,&#34; he says, &#34;I&#39;ll beat him up for you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No don&#39;t,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gets me in my room and then lays me on my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was it this hard when you fell in love with Lorraine?&#34; I get comfy, but I find it difficult as it still feels like the room is spinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love isn&#39;t hard, my dear. It&#39;s easy once you accept it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He probably hates me now,&#34; I say sitting up and wiping my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Far from it, you&#39;ve both made mistakes, luckily for you both, you&#39;re young enough to make them and fix them,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to brush my teeth,&#34; I say and nearly fall out of bed when I get up. He chuckles at me, making me scowl at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can go to bed now that you&#39;re home,&#34; he says and gets up. &#34;Also that dress is way too revealing,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh, I know,&#34; I agree and walk into my bathroom to brush my teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I&#39;ve brushed my teeth I notice I have no water up here, I have a feeling my mouth is going to be dry as sandpaper in the morning. Slowly I make my way back downstairs. I had to stop a couple of times because I&#39;m pretty sure the stairs were moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staggering into the kitchen, I feel a sense of relief for making it here unscathed. Logan is sat at the island counter with a drink in his hand. He looks up from his phone at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here for water,&#34; I say, pointing to the sink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your friends are ok by the way,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, I thought you&#39;d be screwing Chloe,&#34; I mutter as I fill a glass up with water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your problem?&#34; he snaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just saying,&#34; I say and drink half of my water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not you, I don&#39;t screw your friends,&#34; I choke on the water, what do I even say to that? &#34;What have I done to you?&#34; he asks. I place my glass on the side and look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we talk about this in the morning?&#34; I ask and move to walk out of the kitchen. He follows me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No tell me what I&#39;ve done,&#34; he says and grabs me by my arm. &#34;It&#39;s like you&#39;re on a mission to show me how much you hate me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t hate you, Logan,&#34; I say, and he lets go of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a funny way of showing that, because you&#39;re doing everything in your power to hurt me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it matter? You&#39;re leaving, so don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m hurting you,&#34; I snap and walk away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m leaving because of you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you&#39;re leaving because you want to,&#34; I say. &#34;Since we broke up all you have done is do what you want,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You broke up with me, what did you expect me to do? You gave me no real reason. I thought we were good, and you just drop this bomb and walk away with no care in the world. I did nothing but love you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; I shout and push him away from me. &#34;I didn&#39;t ask you to love me, I didn&#39;t ask to be in love with you, I don&#39;t want any of this, and yet you still made me do it, and I hate you for it,&#34; I cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You love me?&#34; he asks and steps towards me. I wipe my eyes and look away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wipe that smirk off your face,&#34; I snap and walk away from him. He takes me by my hand and pulls me to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say it again,&#34; he says and makes me look up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I softly whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, Megan,&#34; he says. I close my eyes, letting my tears fall. His lips softly graze mine. &#34;It&#39;s ok to say it,&#34; I shake my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you can use it against me,&#34; I know full well he wouldn&#39;t, it&#39;s just my stupid fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone I have loved hurts me in some way,&#34; I say. He kisses my forehead and then kisses me on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are amazingly stubborn,&#34; he says against my lips. &#34;I love you; if I hurt you I&#39;ll hurt myself first,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too,&#34; I mutter. He smiles and presses his lips to mine. He picks me up, making me wrap my legs around his waist. Logan carries me up the stairs to my room.</p>
