                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m sitting in a study, hiding from them. My name hasn&#39;t been shouted so I guess they aren&#39;t looking for me which is good. I just hope Melanie&#39;s dad doesn&#39;t decide to come in here, I don&#39;t understand why he has a study when he&#39;s a doctor, although as far as studies go he has a plasma TV and a mini fridge and a mini bar so I guess it was more his escape from the family when sports were on. Yes I&#39;ve raided the mini bar and only found white rum which I don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m not guzzling it down but I wasn&#39;t exactly sipping it either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan?&#34; I hear someone say. I slowly sat up and looked to see if it was her dad. He frowns at me while walking towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I said, laying my head on my lap and he stopped &#34;please don&#39;t hit me,&#34; I said closing my eyes &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I mumbled. I hear more movement and then the door shuts. I open my eyes to see he has gone. I sigh and sit up while bringing the bottle to my lips and gulping more of the clear liquid down. The door opens once more and I take the bottle from my lips and tilt my head back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me the bottle,&#34; I hear Logan&#39;s English accent order to me. I don&#39;t move my hands and then I feel it be taken out of my hands. I sigh and tilt my head down and to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re angry,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can hear it in your voice,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well wouldn&#39;t you just be a tad annoyed,&#34; he snaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hit me if you want it&#39;s ok with me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going to hit you,&#34;he says, taking my hands and pulling me up but failing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not, a lot of people would,&#34; I pause, &#34;it&#39;s not like I&#39;m not used to being hit,&#34; I say. He sighs and sits down next to me. I turn to look at him and out of the corner of my eye I see Melanie, her mom, dad, Kellie and Brendan. &#34;I want to go see my dad,&#34; I said quietly &#34;and I want him and my mom back,&#34; I said looking at Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I want my mother and father back too but I have to be happy with what I&#39;ve got,&#34;he says. I sigh and look away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You suck,&#34; I said &#34;and I hate you,&#34; I said laying my head on my lap &#34;and I feel like I&#39;m going to be sick,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on,&#34;he says, trying to get me to stand again and this time get me to stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you stop touching me,&#34; I snap and yank myself away from him and push him away. &#34;Why is everyone trying to touch me? Just stop it,&#34; I yell and move away from him &#34;I want to be left alone,&#34; I cry and sit on the floor with my knees to my chest. I then hear the door shut. I look to see it was only me, Logan and Melanie&#39;s mom in the room now. &#34;I want my mom,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah well you can&#39;t have her can you,&#34; Logan snapS &#34;stop fucking about and get your arse up,&#34; he yells.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan, don&#39;t shout at her,&#34; Melanie&#39;s mom says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Its fine,&#34; I mumbled &#34;he likes shouting at me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah about as much as I like seeing you like this,&#34; he snaps. I remain silent and look away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He doesn&#39;t understand no matter how much he says he does. I have tried to show him so many times how I feel and what I&#39;m thinking but he doesn&#39;t seem to get it. This was the only way I knew how to cope and shouting at me doesn&#39;t make a difference. I don&#39;t understand why he doesn&#39;t just give up on me other people would, what has made him stay with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34;he said quietly and sat down beside me &#34;I don&#39;t like shouting at you and I don&#39;t like snapping at you, it&#39;s just I&#39;ve told you many times to come to me rather than do this,&#34; he states. I turn and look at him to see him looking straight at me. &#34;Do you want a hug?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I said looking away from him, &#34;I want you to leave me alone,&#34; I heard him sigh deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? What have I done?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing I just want you to leave me alone you&#39;re always pestering me and I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re always here with me, it&#39;s confusing,&#34; I mumble &#34;I just want to be left alone,&#34; I said and the room falls silent. I wipe my tears and close my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m not going to leave you alone,&#34; he finally says, breaking the silence. I look around to see it is just me and him. I hadn&#39;t even heard Melanie&#39;s mom leave. &#34;Because the truth is I can&#39;t be alone at the moment and I need you,&#34;he says. I frown &#34;I&#39;m being serious, I&#39;m not in a very good place at the moment and I actually have the urge to join you in all this self pity. I just know that it won&#39;t be good for you if I do,&#34; he explains. &#34;Now you may not want a hug but I do,&#34; I sigh and move closer to him. He moves his arms around me and I hug him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok maybe I needed this hug,&#34; I said holding him tighter &#34;I just have this feeling something bad is going to happen sooner or later because everything has been going a little too good,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that why you&#39;re so I hate life at the moment?&#34; he asks. I sigh and relax in his arms. He stroked his hand up and down my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s just I don&#39;t see the point anymore,&#34; I state &#34;everything has been taken away from me so I don&#39;t see the point or the need for me to be alive,&#34; I state. He sighs deeply and he moves a hand to my hands. &#34;I know I probably sound pathetic but that&#39;s how I feel,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t sound pathetic I&#39;ve been where you are now and I understand how you feel,&#34; I look at him &#34;I was just more self destructive than suicidal because to me suicide is a cowards way out,&#34; he pauses &#34;I&#39;m not calling you a coward but when you do self harm don&#39;t you at least spare a thought for the people around you? Not many suicide victims do, because they are so wrapped up in their own shit that they don&#39;t realise there are other people around them that are hurting too but because they are worried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know suicide is a selfish act but I don&#39;t know it just seems like the easiest option,&#34; I said and rest my head on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm it does,&#34; he said &#34;I want you to do something for me. I want you to think before you next do something like this,&#34; he said facing my wrist to him &#34;ok?&#34; he asks. I nod and feel him kiss the top of my head. &#34;Thank you, now come on, I want to go home,&#34; he said, pushing me up and then standing up. I sigh and let him help me stand. I stagger into him and he moves his arm around me, steadying me completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walk out of the study and he gives the bottle back to Melanie&#39;s mom. It was only Melanie&#39;s mom and dad that were out here. They both gave me a small smile &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I said quietly while looking down at my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine Megan as I&#39;m sure this isn&#39;t the first time you and Melanie have sneaked into one of our liquor cabinets,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s mostly Melanie&#39;s fault she&#39;s the one that gets it not me I&#39;m just sat reading a magazine and she comes in with her hands full,&#34; I state, she laughs and walks with us to the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan sits with Max laying his head on her lap. She&#39;s stroking his head while watching TV. Carl is still here unfortunately, I found out he hadn&#39;t paid his rent so he&#39;s hiding from his landlord. This means he&#39;s staying here for a few days. I&#39;m just waiting for him to go to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we watch something more interesting like CSI?&#34; she suddenly asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not on,&#34; Carl said as he flicks through channels &#34;nothing is ever on,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well can we watch a movie I&#39;m bored,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m surprised you&#39;re not passed out right now after how much you drank,&#34; he states while looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl shut up and put a movie on,&#34; I snap and rub my leg. He sighs and does what I say. &#34;Megan on Sunday I won&#39;t be able to go to your granddads with you,&#34; I state. There was silence for a moment then she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have something important to do so I&#39;ll be out most of the day and probably won&#39;t be back until later on in the day,&#34; I state and look at her to see her looking down at her lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; she said and slowly gets up &#34;I&#39;m gonna go to bed,&#34; she said looking at me. I nod a little &#34;Urm yeah Night,&#34; she said and walks out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She didn&#39;t take that very well,&#34; Carl said after we hear her bedroom door shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm I knew she wouldn&#39;t but I can&#39;t help it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you can&#39;t, I don&#39;t see why you just don&#39;t tell her you&#39;re off to Steph&#39;s funeral,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah sorry Megan can&#39;t come to see your granddad with you because I&#39;m off to my wife&#39;s funeral who you thought died well before I met you when in actual fact I killed her a few days ago,&#34; I pause &#34;that would really go down well wouldn&#39;t it she&#39;ll really trust me then,&#34; I mock and roll my eyes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just saying,&#34; he said and sits down back in the seat he was in and plays the movie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well don&#39;t, I know what I&#39;m doing,&#34; I snap and reach for my weed and roll ups.</p>
