                <p>My whole body froze when I felt arms go around my waist. I then relaxed and a tingling sensation slowly started to burn when I felt Logan&#39;s kisses on my neck. He squeezed me tightly as I finished making myself a cup of tea. &#34;Why did you tell him?&#34; he asked me in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would be a bit difficult to hide it from him when he&#39;s living with us,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True,&#34; he said and laid his head on my shoulder &#34;sorry I scared you a minute ago,&#34; I frowned and looked at him as I held the mug to my lips. &#34;You froze when I moved my hands round you,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, I just never heard you come into the kitchen that&#39;s all,&#34; I state and turned away from him. I felt him start to kiss my neck again and I slowly moved out of his grasp. &#34;I may be going out later,&#34; I state while walking out of the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who with?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendan,&#34; I muttered and sat on the couch. I heard him sigh and sit on the other couch.&#34;I may not yet it depends on how I feel,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And where will you go with him?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s another party apparently but I&#39;ve got a feeling he may not want to go so we may just stay at his or here,&#34; I explained. He sighs and looked at the TV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have to meet up with him tonight?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No not really, he just sent me a text asking if I wanted to go to a party tonight or meet up with him,&#34; I say. &#34;But like I said it depends on how I&#39;m feeling,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well do you want to go?&#34; he asks. I shrugged, causing him to sigh in frustration. I smirked as I watched him get himself more and more annoyed. He got so jealous and worked up so easily it was amusing. I just wondered how far his jealousy would go. Would he get controlling or would he push his jealousy away because he knows I&#39;d never cheat on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m gonna go get ready,&#34; I said, getting up and picking my mug up with me. I narrowed my eyes as he followed me out of the living room and up the stairs into my room. After ten minutes or so I was dressed and was now putting on my makeup.  I looked at him from my mirror to see him looking like he was arguing with himself in his head. He looked at what I was wearing for the fourth time and then looked away and sighs. I rolled my eyes at him and continued to put my mascara on. After I had finished putting mascara on I felt his arms go around my waist and down to my thighs and pulled at my thigh high stockings. His hands then moved to my long top that I was using as a dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you not wear more clothes?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would I?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just think you should because it&#39;s cold out,&#34;he states I looked at him from the mirror to see he was lying; he obviously wasn&#39;t comfortable with what I was wearing. I sigh and move closer to my mirror. He raised an eyebrow as he looked down, I cleared my throat and he looked back up at me &#34;I&#39;m not saying what you&#39;re wearing isn&#39;t nice, I just think you may be really cold if you went out like this,&#34; He explained. I slowly shook my head and put on a layer of lip gloss and put on my high heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right he should be here soon,&#34; I state and gave him a quick kiss on the lips. He sighs and pulls me towards him and hugs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you promise me something while you&#39;re out with him?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything,&#34; I said, hugging him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That you won&#39;t let him touch you at all, and I mean at all. A hug is fine but I mean anything more than that and well I will have to kill him,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan I&#39;d never cheat on you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but it&#39;s him I don&#39;t trust,&#34;he said pulling away and looking down at me &#34;he just screams don&#39;t trust ever,&#34; he explained and moved his hands up to my chin and cupped my face. I smiled a little and looked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want you to go but you want to go so I&#39;m not going to stop you, I&#39;m far from a controlling boyfriend. At least I don&#39;t think I am, you&#39;d have to tell me if I am or not,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you&#39;re not,&#34; I said and moved my arms down to his jean belt. I then moved closer and kissed him on the lips &#34;But what do I know I&#39;ve only been going out with you for less than an hour,&#34; I said with a small smile and slowly leaned in to kiss him. He smirked back at me and kissed me back while moving his hands through my hair and pushed my body against his. I pulled back &#34;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll go to the party now, after all there seems to be a lot of good entertainment right here,&#34; I said smiling and slowly moved my hands up his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just good, I&#39;m offended,&#34;he said with fake shock, &#34;very offended,&#34;he said and started to move me towards my bed as he kissed me. I collapsed on my bed with him on top. His hands moved up my dress, over my panties to my stomach and my hands moved to his belt buckle and I started to unbuckle his belt when he stopped me and pulled away from me. &#34;You&#39;re very far from ready for any of that,&#34; I sigh and was about to say something when he spoke first &#34;plus I have an age limit which is 18, especially for you,&#34;he said looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what if I&#39;m ready before then,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you will have to wait for me and I will be ready when you finish high school, the minute after graduation,&#34; he paused. &#34;Probably the second you finish graduation because I will have you in a hotel room faster than you can say sex,&#34; he said and leaned in to kiss me. I tried to unbuckle him again when he pulled back again. &#34;Megan,&#34;he said sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We could do other things,&#34; I said innocently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No we can&#39;t,&#34; he said and stood up. I raised an eyebrow and tilted my head at him. &#34;OK we could but not right now, later,&#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I said and got up off my bed and walked into my wardrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing now?&#34; he asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m getting changed, I don&#39;t want to go out now, I want to stay in,&#34; I said loudly so he could hear as I took my clothes off and got changed into some clean bottoms and a vest top. I walked out and looked at him to see him smile a little. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34;he said and stood up &#34;I just have the feeling you were testing me,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I may have been,&#34; I said innocently and looked down. He chuckled and pulled me into a hug &#34;I just wanted to see what you&#39;re like when you&#39;re jealous. I mean I did date someone who was always jealous and would flip out whenever he saw me talking to a guy,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm well all I&#39;m thinking about right now is how much I will be free from Carl and his hands. I just know that from now on I will be able to walk around the house without being violated,&#34;he said as he pulled away and started to walk with me out of my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really think so, because it really doesn&#39;t bother me I think it&#39;s funny,&#34; I state &#34;I mean the things he comes out with are pure genius, I mean I&#39;m not homophobic or anything and well he is bisexual so he isn&#39;t 100% he&#39;s half and half,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to put up with it, I do,&#34;he states. I chuckled and walked across the landing into the games room to see Carl playing Call of Duty. He looked at Logan and then smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m killing your English people,&#34;he says. I laughed &#34;And it&#39;s your own fault I will never let your people go, muahaha,&#34; he said with an evil laugh and then carried on playing the game. &#34;Oh what I just fucking died you son of a bitch go fuck your own fucking mother,&#34; he lashed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure it&#39;s you doing all the killing,&#34; Logan said and walked towards him taking the Wii remote off him. &#34;Now watch me kick your American arse,&#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fine,&#34; Carl said and walked over to me &#34;me and Megan will go play doctor,&#34;he said moving his arm around me &#34;this is the part where you kick me in the groin and run off,&#34;he said in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go play guitar hero instead, I like beating you,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine and I had all the tools as well for the doctor,&#34; he huffed as he followed me to the other TV to set up guitar hero on the PS5.</p>
