                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood at Stephanie&#39;s grave, my hands in my pockets. My fists clenched as I frowned; I didn&#39;t know what to do anymore. I had no one to truly confide in and get answers to the questions I needed to ask. &#34;What should I do?&#34; I muttered to myself as I stared at the silver letters of her full name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She isn&#39;t going to talk back,&#34; a woman said behind me. I turned to see my old therapist, Melanie&#39;s mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got a phone call from Carl telling me that you were quickly heading on a downward spiral to your past self,&#34; she explained. And well, I knew you would turn up here at some point,&#34; she states. I didn&#39;t think you would jog it, though,&#34; she says to herself and walks towards me. So what do you need help with?&#34; she asks, still looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34; I said quietly. She remained silent and looked at Stephanie&#39;s grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s weird how Megan is still alive don&#39;t you think?&#34; I looked at her &#34;I mean she has gone through a lot worse than what Stephanie went through and for a lot longer than Stephanie as her mother only had the psychotic break a year before Stephanie had been put on life support,&#34; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your point?&#34; I snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No point, I was just thinking out loud,&#34; she said and then turned to look at me &#34;now tell me why you don&#39;t know what to do about Megan,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t know what to do it&#39;s just I don&#39;t know how to stop doing the wrong things,&#34; I took a deep breath &#34;last night she yelled at me, I may have been imagining it as I was high but I think it did happen,&#34; I state &#34;she was upset with me, she said I don&#39;t open up to her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you?&#34; she asks. I nodded, and then she tilted her head at me &#34;Do you open up to her like she does to you? Like do you tell her what&#39;s on your mind and how you are feeling and what you have gone through?&#34; she asks. I sigh and shake my head. &#34;So how do you think she&#39;s feeling?&#34; I shrugged, &#34;she doesn&#39;t feel trusted by you, Logan and she&#39;s most likely feeling like she&#39;s living with a stranger that she&#39;s entrusted all her feeling onto, a person she doesn&#39;t even know,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But if I tell her everything she&#39;ll never trust me and most likely be disgusted by me,&#34; she sighs &#34;I mean I wasn&#39;t the most pleasant of people before was I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but do you really think she&#39;ll hate you?&#34; she asks. I nod and close my eyes. &#34;How does that make you feel?&#34; I smirk. Yeah, I know the most famous question in my profession,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t be able to bare it if she ever hated me, even the thought; me makes me want to break,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need her then?&#34; she asks. I nodded &#34;just like she needs you, and you need to start opening up to her because once you do she&#39;ll start to come out of her shell more,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s already come out of her shell,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has a love bite, three to be exact which means she&#39;s already come out of that shell of hers,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who by?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not by me that&#39;s for one,&#34; I said and looked at her. &#34;And before you ask I am completely outraged and if I find out who, I will kill them with my own hands,&#34; I say. She smiled a little and shook her head while looking away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t let jealousy get the better of you Logan,&#34; she stated and then started to walk away &#34;Come on you&#39;re not going to find any answers here,&#34; she says, I sigh and look away from her &#34;now Logan,&#34; she snapped. I growled and followed her out of the graveyard to her car. She turned to look at me once we got to her car. &#34;Why did you run it here?&#34; she asks. &#34;Especially with your leg,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I needed to be out of that house and well jogging clears my mind, and as for my leg no pain no gain,&#34; I state and opened the passenger door to her car. &#34;Why would you leave your car unlocked?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it&#39;s a guarded graveyard that&#39;s why,&#34; she said and got in the driver&#39;s seat. She shut the door and then turned to look at me. &#34;You have to talk to her, do you understand me?&#34; she asks. I sigh &#34;There&#39;s no way around it Logan, you know everything about that girl and she only knows the basics of you,  if you don&#39;t want her to shut you out, then you need to open up,&#34; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I said defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to tell her everything all at once, just tell her little bits. Like tell her about Stephanie,&#34; she paused, waiting for me to answer her. I slowly shook my head &#34;Well don&#39;t be surprised when she starts to push you away and let someone else in,&#34; she said and started the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After so many minutes she sighs and looks at me. I frowned at her and looked away. &#34;You need a good slap you do,&#34; she suddenly said, making me look at her and frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard,&#34; she said looking back onto the road &#34;you need some sense knocking into you and well if I could take you Logan I&#39;d gladly slap you silly,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you even allowed to say any of this to me?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care if I am or if I&#39;m not, you&#39;re not going to report me anyway,&#34; she said and glanced at me &#34;you don&#39;t seem to realise anything, you never realise when you&#39;re wrong or what you&#39;re doing is wrong,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm excuse me I realised that falling for my student was and is wrong,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really think so?&#34; she asked and glanced at me &#34;even if you and her became lovers you&#39;d be the best man she&#39;s had in her life for a very long time. Because let&#39;s face it her ex-boyfriend wasn&#39;t exactly a saint to her,&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop changing the subject,&#34; she snapped while slapping my leg, my bad lag at that, I winced a little &#34;did that hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all, that&#39;s why I&#39;m wincing in pain,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good I&#39;m glad it hurts because that&#39;s what you deserve,&#34; she snapped and then the car was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drove into the driveway of the house I was living in with Megan and turned the engine off. I sigh and look towards the door of the house to see her talking to a dark haired guy. &#34;What the hell is he doing here?&#34; I heard Susan say. I looked at her, &#34;I don&#39;t see him all weekend and I find him here, great,&#34; she huffed and got out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s your son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s Brendan,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you even know?&#34; I ask,  getting out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because a mother knows what her son looks like from behind and well that&#39;s his motorbike which he shouldn&#39;t be riding,&#34; she said and walked towards the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and walk around the car to the house. Megan and Brendan both turned to look at us and Brendan muttered something which caused Megan to smile a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; Susan snapped at her son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was on my way home, I was just leaving,&#34;he said, frowning a little and looked at Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my fault you haven&#39;t seen him all weekend,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No it isn&#39;t I saw you Sunday. Saturday and Friday I was just avoiding home,&#34; he said and then looked at his mom. &#34;Yeah it&#39;s entirely her fault,&#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get home,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been home though and well dad knows I&#39;m out,&#34; he said and then frowned once more &#34;why am I even explaining this, I&#39;m not 12,&#34; he said to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan sighs and looked towards me, she was dressed now and it seemed she had noticed the love bites on her neck as she was now wearing a turtle neck jumper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is my fault,&#34; Megan said looking at Susan &#34;something happened and I needed someone to talk to and well I had no one, so I phoned him,&#34; she said and Susan sighs &#34;sorry,&#34; Megan said and then folded her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now?&#34; Susan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now well he just turned up, that&#39;s none of my doing,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is, because we were texting and I asked  you how you were and you just put; &#39;been worse,&#39; so when I asked  you if you wanted to talk you said yes hence why I signed out,&#34; he says. Susan sighs and rubs her temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway why are you asking me why I&#39;m here, why are you here?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s my psychologist,&#34; I said and walked up the steps &#34;and she was giving me a lift home,&#34; I said and then walked past Megan. I now knew who the person was that gave Megan the love bites. I walked up to my bedroom and into the bathroom while taking my top off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were off to the gym,&#34; I heard Carl state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I changed my mind and went for a run instead,&#34; I paused and looked at him &#34;Why do I look like I need to go to the gym?&#34; I ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, you&#39;re getting a belly,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where,&#34; I said, looking down at myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s underneath that amazing hot six pack of yours,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you phone Susan?&#34; I ask .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;m worried about you, you&#39;re not exactly the best person to be around right now,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah well if you don&#39;t like it you know what to do,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you have to hurt my feelings like that,&#34; he fake cried &#34;all I do is care about you and this is how you treat me, I won&#39;t be surprised if I come home one day to find you in bed with another woman,&#34; he fake cried and then did a dramatic huff and stuck his nose in the air while folding his arms and walking off. &#34;Don&#39;t think you&#39;re getting any tonight,&#34; he called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aww boo who,&#34; I said to myself and walked back into the bathroom to get a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After my shower I walked into my bedroom with the towel wrapped around me and saw Megan sitting on my bed. I gave her a confused look and she stood and then without giving me warning hugged me.</p>
