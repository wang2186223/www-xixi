                <p>I walk into the gym where I hear voices to see Logan, Carl, Yasmin and Melanie. I gulp knowing Logan now knew that I lied to him.

                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll talk later,&#34; he said and walks out. I sigh and look at Carl, he gives me a small smile.</p>

                <p>&#34;Tell him that and if he doesn&#39;t understand that then dump him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what I say,&#34; Yasmin said &#34;but she doesn&#39;t want to dump him or something like that,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait haven&#39;t you only been together for about two weeks not even that?&#34; I ask. She nods &#34;well that&#39;s silly you don&#39;t even know him, just talk to him, he probably doesn&#39;t want to just yet you probably just got the wrong idea,&#34; I explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True,&#34; she said and her phone starts ringing. She looks at it smiles and walks off while answering the phone. I look at Carl and he smiles at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How annoyed do you think he is?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably a lot, he gets a bit paranoid when people lie to him,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to talk about it to him because I wasn&#39;t doing anything he&#39;s probably thinking,&#34; I said and walk out of the gym in search of Logan. I look in the kitchen, games room and the indoor swimming pool and he isn&#39;t there. I sigh and walk up to his room, I walk in to see he isn&#39;t there either but I hear the shower going. I walk towards his bed and sit down on it and wait for him to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about ten minutes he walked out with a towel wrapped around him and a towel drying his hair. I smile a little as I look him up and down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I want to tell my boyfriend why I lied and where I&#39;ve been and why,&#34; I explain leaning back on his bed on my elbows. He smirks a little and walks to his underwear draw. I watch him put his boxers on under his towel and then take his towel off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been with Brendan I&#39;m guessing,&#34; he states rather than asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I said frowning. He turns and looks at me &#34;I&#39;m telling you the truth,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So why lie to me, I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;ve lied to me,&#34; he said and walks towards me. I sigh and move my hands over my face. I hear movement and then feel him sit next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just tell me Megan,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went to go see Jonathon,&#34; I said quietly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went to go see my father and the reason why I didn&#39;t tell you is because I knew exactly what you would said and what you would do and I felt I needed to go,&#34; I said and look at him. He&#39;s wearing his jeans now looking into space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who did you go with?&#34; he asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one I went on my own,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So why is it that Brendan went out the same time as you?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s just a coincidence but I swear I went on my own,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you even go anyway what possessed you to think that you needed to go?&#34; he asks raising his voice a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To move on to feel better I don&#39;t know, I just did,&#34; I say. He stands and walks out of his room, I sigh and look down at my lap. He then walks back in and stands in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So why not just tell me? Why not allow me to come with you? What made you feel like you couldn&#39;t come to me about this? Because you&#39;d obviously been thinking about it,&#34; he asks. I shrug &#34;I&#39;m going sleeping at my aunt and uncles tonight,&#34; he said and walks out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan wait,&#34; I said going out after him &#34;I&#39;m sorry I am but I needed to go,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah and so do I, I need to get away from someone that doesn&#39;t seem to trust me,&#34; he snaps and walks down the stairs. He grabbed his car keys and pulled on his DC&#39;s and then walks out. I sigh and sit at the top of the stairs moving my hands over my face, I hear footsteps and then feel an arm go around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to tell me what&#39;s happened?&#34; Carl asks me. I look at him and shake my head &#34;ok then it&#39;s up to you what you do,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I tell you later?&#34; I ask he nods &#34;I&#39;m going to try and get some sleep,&#34; I said and stand and walk to my bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sent me the Valentines card?&#34; I ask my eyes wide. He nods &#34;but why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I like you, why else?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Logan knows,&#34; I said to myself &#34;that&#39;s why he&#39;s being off with you,&#34; I said and look at him &#34;Carl this is bad,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not that bad, I liked Stephanie as well but he knew her first and well he didn&#39;t mess up as much as he has with you,&#34; he explains and looks at me. He moves a bit of my hair and then smiles &#34;He makes one more mistake and I&#39;m done hiding my feelings,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm,&#34; I said and look down. &#34;Well he doesn&#39;t think I trust him now so he can make as many mistakes as he wants,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No he can&#39;t,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you can&#39;t say what you&#39;ve just said, you&#39;re pretty much saying mess up with your girlfriend and she&#39;s mine, which isn&#39;t right you can&#39;t say that to him,&#34; I explain and look back at him. He sighs and stands off my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should get some more sleep, I&#39;ll see you in the morning, night night gorgeous&#34; he says and walks out of my room. I sigh and lay back on my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just hoped Logan would be home tomorrow in a better mood and in a more understanding mood. I understood why he was angry with me, I had lied to him and given the impression that I didn&#39;t trust him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finish off the beer in my hand and look around for the bartender. I had been here for about an hour and half. I had come with James and Scott. James had just broken up with his girlfriend which meant he was just looking to get laid and Scott was with him so he didn&#39;t look like a loner. I wasn&#39;t drunk and I wasn&#39;t aiming to get drunk but I needed to think, I need to think about what she said and what she meant. The only thing I don&#39;t understand is why she went to see him in the first place; it&#39;s weird to want to go see your abuser. That&#39;s like a cat wanting to visit the dog that bit its leg off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bartender places a beer in front of me. I frown and look at it then at the bartender. He points to a blonde woman at the other side of the bar. She was dressed in a low cut leopard print top and tight skirt. I sigh and take the beer and give her a little nod to said thanks and look at my phone. For the past half hour I had debated on calling Megan and getting some sense out of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s Megan?&#34; I hear someone said in my ear and by the blonde hair that had fallen over my shoulder I knew it was the blonde that had sent me the drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My girlfriend,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is she?&#34; she asks now moving next to me and resting on her elbows against the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At home we had an argument,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm so does that mean there&#39;s no more girlfriend?&#34; she asks I shrug and look at her &#34;hmm here&#39;s how I see it if there was and you love this girlfriend of yours you&#39;d be at home sorting everything out with her unless she&#39;s done something unforgivable,&#34; she paused &#34;so what has she done?&#34; she asks sitting on the buffet and crossing her left over her right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She lied to me then told me the truth that I think is actually a lie,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh ok then,&#34; she said &#34;it may be the truth, what do you think the truth is?&#34; she asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That she met up with this guy that I hate,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And cheated on you?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I pause &#34;I don&#39;t know, what would you class as cheating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything after a kiss,&#34; she said &#34;hmm you seem to be getting more and more depressed lets change the subject and get a few drinks and cheer you up,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few hours pass and I admit now I&#39;m a bit drunk because the blonde had made me take several shots. This girl I had told her things I hadn&#39;t told Megan. I was telling this girl mostly because I was drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you fancy getting out of here?&#34; she asks. I look at her and stagger towards her and move my arms around her. She smirks and moves her hands around my neck. I lean in and crash my lips onto hers tasting her cherry flavoured lip.</p>
