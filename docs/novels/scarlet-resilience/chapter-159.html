                <p>Sandra had gotten me a selection of clothes as she didn&#39;t know what I&#39;d fully want. I settled on a red ditsy dress that has tie straps at the shoulders. I team it with a denim jacket and my white converse. She had told me that Logan knew I&#39;d stayed at Tyler&#39;s which was just perfect. I think before he speculated everything so he couldn&#39;t say if I were lying or telling the truth as I&#39;d not slept at Tyler&#39;s before and Tyler hadn&#39;t slept over at mine. So for him, it was all assumptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe you slept with him,&#34; Melanie whispers to me as I take my books out of my locker. &#34;Did you use a condom because I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s slept with Courtney several times?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither can I, to be honest, I don&#39;t remember it fully but that bit I do remember&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you might not have?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I did, it felt like I had this morning,&#34; I say, and she sighs and gives me that disappointed look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know he&#39;s going to tell everyone,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know he thinks I&#39;m sleeping with your brother,&#34; I say changing the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So does Logan, my brother seems to be getting action he doesn&#39;t know about,&#34; she says with a laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan is jealous, Tyler thinks it because of the marks on my neck from Logan, I think he thought they were from your brother,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; she asks. &#34;I mean, why my brother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; I don&#39;t want to tell her that Bredon and I had hooked up while I was going out with Tyler. I don&#39;t think she&#39;d take it very well, plus I don&#39;t think Tyler knows about that. I believe Tyler has come to that conclusion because of how Brendon is around me and the fact he went to England with us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Logan still pounding anything with a vagina?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yep,&#34; I say &#34;from what I&#39;ve seen anyway, it&#39;s like a revolving door,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s only doing it to hurt you,&#34; she says, and I give her a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I say, and walk into homeroom to see Logan sat at the desk. I frown as he&#39;s not my homeroom teacher. He doesn&#39;t even have a homeroom class. He looks at me, and I watch as his eyes trail down my body before looking away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Totally checking you out,&#34; Melanie whispers to me as we take our seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure he&#39;s just rating my outfit,&#34; I state as she turns to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, ok,&#34; she says with a roll of her eyes. I smile at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan watches me as I pack my things into my bag. I hadn&#39;t skipped any of his classes since we broke up, I just made sure I was on time and left with everyone else. This time around, he&#39;d asked to speak to me in front of everyone so I couldn&#39;t make a run for it once the bell had gone for the first period.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you stay over the weekend?&#34; he asks. I look at him and put my bag on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know where I stayed,&#34; I say as I walk up to him. I stop about a meter away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you and him together?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I say, and lean against one of the desks and fold my arms. I have been trying my best to keep distance between us, to try and stamp down the feelings I have for him, but every time I see him, it rears its ugly head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Butterflies congregate in my stomach, my heart beats slightly faster, and my body betrays me. My mind is just to blame when all I think about when I&#39;m in his presence is how he makes me feel both physically and emotionally. Like right now, all I want is to have him hold me, and I have to remind myself of the pain to come if I allow myself to give in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re just fucking?&#34; he asks, and I see the anger in his eyes. I sigh and look at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you ask to talk to me just for this or was it school-related?&#34; I ask, and then look back at him as he remains silent. &#34;Well I&#39;ll leave then,&#34; I say making my way to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So how many others are you laying down for,&#34; I sigh and turn to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re sleeping with anything with a pulse, so what does it matter who I sleep with? We&#39;re not together anymore, so my life doesn&#39;t concern you,&#34; I snap, &#34;I&#39;m not insulting you, so what makes it ok for you to do that to me?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not going to see the people I&#39;ve slept with every fucking day, you&#39;re not even going to hear about it, I am,&#34; he snaps and walks towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is not my problem; I don&#39;t sit there afterwards and tell them to talk about me in front of you, I can&#39;t control when or where they talk about me,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So there is more than one,&#34; he tries to clarify, I knew that is what he would focus on. I sigh and look down. He stands in front of me, and it&#39;s only then I realise he&#39;s in touching distance. I take a few steps back until I&#39;m against the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not saying,&#34; he cuts me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you enjoy it? What marks do you give us all? Is it out of ten, or is it a 1st place, 2nd place kind of ranking?&#34; He mocks me and steps towards me and places his hands on the door trapping me between the door and him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I say, and look up at him and I know I&#39;m close to crying. His blue eyes glare at me with such anger I never thought he&#39;d ever look at me like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has to be that hasn&#39;t it, you never gave me a real reason for breaking up with me, so I&#39;m gonna guess I come last or something, I bet you were fucking them and comparing me to them while we were together,&#34; he accuses and anger flares in me. How dare he accuse me of cheating on him. &#34;That&#39;s why you were good, practising with them, you should think about charging them,&#34; and I can&#39;t help it, I slap him as hard as I can across the face as my anger boils up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can accuse me of sleeping with anyone you want, but I won&#39;t let you accuse me of cheating on you because that is an outright lie, I never cheated on you, I gave you and only you, my body. I slept with Tyler for the first fucking time last night, and I regretted it as soon as I woke up this morning, and as for Brendon, he&#39;s just had surgery, even I know you&#39;re not that stupid to think that. You and Tyler, that is it. So don&#39;t you dare say I cheated on you because it is just not true,&#34; I growl at him, and I can feel the tears go down my cheeks. I wipe my tears away and then turn. &#34;Let me out,&#34; I order as I try to calm my emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just Tyler,&#34; he says quietly. I say nothing and move my hand to the handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me out,&#34; I repeat, then I feel his hand on my arm. He turns me around and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You broke up with me, yet you&#39;re the one that keeps crying,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah well, I&#39;m an emotional mess I thought we established that,&#34; I say wiping my cheeks again. He then pulls me to him and presses his lips to mine. My body defies me, and I kiss him back, pulling him into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re my emotional mess,&#34; he says, pulling away and kissing down my neck as he lifts my feet off the ground. I hold my legs up onto his hips and feel him press his body to mine. His hand moves up my thigh to my panties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to stop this before we go any further, yet my body has other ideas as my hands move down to his trousers, and I feel just how hard he is. He kisses back up my neck and nibbles my bottom lip before taking my mouth with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moaning I kiss him back as my defences and the fight leaves me. His fingers massage my sex through my panties, and I can&#39;t help my reaction. He looks at me, and I want him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the bell goes, indicating I&#39;m late for my first lesson and also reminding me where we are.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop,&#34; I say, pulling away from him and pushing him away from me. He looks at me, and I let go of him, dropping my legs back down and smoothing my dress back into place. I should probably stop wearing dresses although I doubt what I&#39;m wearing would make any difference. &#34;This can&#39;t happen,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34; he asks. &#34;You want me just as much as I want you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I don&#39;t,&#34; I snap and push him even further from me. &#34;We are over, and we are staying that way,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock sounds at the door, and I step forward and open the door to see Carl. He looks at me and frowns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; he asks. I glare at Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not touch me ever again, don&#39;t even look at me, I don&#39;t want you,&#34; I say with finality. If only I believed my own words. I walk out of the room, pushing Carl out of my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to make sure he doesn&#39;t want me, and the only way to do that is to show him just how finished we are.</p>
