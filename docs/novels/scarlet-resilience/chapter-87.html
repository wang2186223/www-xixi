                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My whole body felt so relaxed and comfortable, I didn&#39;t want to move but it seemed Max had other plans. I can feel him licking my fingers. I open my eyes and look down at him and move my hand onto his head. He barks and jumps up at me and starts to lick my face. I move away from him and groan in disapproval of his way of waking me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m up go away,&#34; I said trying to push the husky away from me. I look to where Logan lays to see he isn&#39;t there but there is a black box with a white ribbon and a card. I sit up and move my hands through my hair. I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>look at Max and he tilts his head at me. I smile and pat the bed he jumps on it and starts to lick my face again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Max lay down,&#34; I order and he lays pretty much in between my legs. I reach for the card and open it to see &#39;To my Girlfriend on Her Birthday,&#39; I raise my eyebrows and open the card to see it had no printed writing just what Logan had wrote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;To Megan, You should have told me it was your birthday so this is your fault that it&#39;s late if it&#39;s late next year which it won&#39;t be it will be my fault. Anyway hope you had an amazing day which I know you didn&#39;t because you didn&#39;t tell me it was your birthday. Happy Birthday Babe, Logan xxx. P.S do you like being called babe if you don&#39;t tell me. Xxx&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile and pick up the black box with a white ribbon. I untie the ribbon and open the black box to see another box in white with the word &#39;Pandora,&#39; etched into the velvet in black. I open the box to see a silver and gold charmed bracelet with pink hearts. I take the bracelet out of the box and unclip it and hold it in front of Max.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s really pretty isn&#39;t it?&#34; I said to Max he just looks at me and I smile &#34;and heavy for a charm bracelet and it&#39;s by Pandora,&#34; I said and put the bracelet on. I then get up out of bed and pull on my bottoms. Max sits up and looks at me. I walk out of the bedroom and down the stairs. I walk into the living room to see he wasn&#39;t there I then walk into the dining room to see him sat eating breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone is up apart from Brendan. Logan his sat with his back to me and he&#39;s reading the paper. I walk up behind him and move my arms around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; he said taking a sip of his drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I whisper in his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you like it?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I do,&#34; I said and he moves his hand to my wrists and strokes the bracelet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad took my awhile to pick it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s a little liar he just went into the shop and went I want that one, didn&#39;t even batter an eyelid at the 2k price,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl,&#34; Logan growls and picks up his phone and throws it at him. Carl ducks and the phone hits the back of his chair with a thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see how hard he threw that? He would have took off my head if I didn&#39;t duck,&#34; Carl said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too bad you ducked then,&#34; Yasmin said taking a sip of her coffee and Carl looks at her in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bet you like it rough don&#39;t you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why what?&#34; Julie asks ignoring Carl</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone ignores me it&#39;s not fair,&#34; he huffs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bought her a bracelet for her birthday but she didn&#39;t tell me it was in February after valentines day,&#34; he said and looks at me. I smile and sit down in the seat next to him and look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two grand?&#34; I ask and he just glares at Carl &#34;why would you spend that much on me?&#34; I ask &#34;and for my birthday at that,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan accept the gift and if you&#39;re not happy with it give it away,&#34; he said looking at me and then standing up &#34;I&#39;ll get your breakfast,&#34; he said and walks out. I smile and then notice everyone looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I talk to you?&#34; Melanie suddenly says. I look at her and nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now or...&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm just when you&#39;ve got some time,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can talk now,&#34; I said getting up. She looks at her boyfriend and I then realise she&#39;s actually in a mood with him. I frown and follow her out of the room to the stairs. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think of Cade?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quiet,&#34; I said and she looks down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We had an argument last night,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; I ask and she nods &#34;that&#39;s surprising, you haven&#39;t been going out for long,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it wasn&#39;t anything serious really, I think the alcohol influenced it more than anything,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was the argument about?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wanted to sleep in my bed with me, Julie had crashed out on the couch down here and we were going to bed and he got a bit full on,&#34; she said and looks down. I look down at her and smile &#34;I think we&#39;re ok now though it&#39;s just he gets a little funny with me sometimes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angry like not all the time but sometimes I&#39;ll go to meet him and he&#39;ll just snap at me for nothing,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe he&#39;s stressed out,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what I thought because he&#39;s been getting loads of work and I told him it was ok for us not to meet if he needed to do work but he say&#39;s it&#39;s find but then he gets stressed at me,&#34; she said and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has she said sorry yet?&#34; I ask and she shakes her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well wait and see if he said sorry to you for last night,&#34; I said and she nods and stands up. I hug her. &#34;Are you coming shopping?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah Logan told us about it,&#34; she said and I pull back. She takes my right hand and looks at the Bracelet Logan got me. &#34;It&#39;s really pretty,&#34; she said and then looks at me &#34;you look like you&#39;re starting to feel happy,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I am,&#34; I said and smile. She smiles and hugs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad,&#34; she said and holds me tightly &#34;I do hope he doesn&#39;t screw up,&#34; she said and I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So do I,&#34; I said and walk with her back into the dining room to see Logan back at the table and a bowl of coco pops. I sit down in my seat and look at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Logan asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing it&#39;s just been a very long time since I&#39;ve had these,&#34; I said and he looks at me. &#34;I&#39;ll just shut up and eat,&#34; I said and he smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;George,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir,&#34; I look around and see him walk into the dining room from the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you get me the amount of money I&#39;m allowed to spend?&#34; he asks &#34;please,&#34; he adds and George nods. &#34;I don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m still on a budget it&#39;s unfair,&#34; Logan said and Carl laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well do we really need to go into the reasons,&#34; Carl said and Logan gets up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my money,&#34; he said finishing his drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t act like a spoilt Brat,&#34; Scott says. I look at Melanie and give her a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Brendan?&#34; I ask now ignoring Logan&#39;s conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not well, he&#39;s got a headache,&#34; she said &#34;it&#39;s not a hangover cause he only had one beer last night and was on Cola all night,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said he wasn&#39;t feeling well last night,&#34; Yasmin says. I frown and look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s asleep at the moment,&#34; Cade said and that&#39;s probably the first time I&#39;ve heard him speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said &#34;I&#39;ll go see him when we get back,&#34; I said and start to eat my breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan opens the briefcase and looks inside it. I lean forward and just see money. I look at him and I&#39;m watching him count it. He takes two wads out and then closes the suit case. He then leans over and places it on the passenger seat of the limo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it just that amount?&#34; he asks the driver named David.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you have an extra 500 thousand for this year you&#39;ve already spent 100,000 this year,&#34; he said and Logan sighs &#34;I know it&#39;s not fair but that&#39;s what you get for blowing three million in one year on parties,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan smirks to himself and looks out of the window. I move his arm over my shoulder and lay my head on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They have heard of your arrival,&#34; David said and Logan sighs &#34;you have meetings with them starting tonight,&#34; he said and Logan looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like we should make the best of today,&#34; he said &#34;well I should,&#34; he mutters afterwards.</p>
