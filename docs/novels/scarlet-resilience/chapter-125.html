                <p>This is all I need, I wonder if anyone else is going to add to the pile of stress I have. I feel like I&#39;m going to snap from it all. I think I&#39;d be able to cope with Melanie if it wasn&#39;t for what&#39;s happening back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t everything just go right for once?&#34; I ask out loud and both Logan and Carl look at each other and then back at me. &#34;We&#39;re doing good and then you break up with me over your fucking uncle and then we get back together and Jonathan decides to make a run for it and Melanie decides she&#39;s in love with me, it&#39;s like something good happens for something bad to happen,&#34; I explain in one big breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait? You&#39;re back together?&#34; Carl asks and I look at Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I forgot to tell you,&#34; he says to him and Carl just frowns at him. &#34;We&#39;re not telling anyone but you and Yasmin so feel honoured,&#34; Logan adds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm and just how can you forget something like that?&#34; Carl asks him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a busy couple days,&#34; Logan says and looks at me. &#34;You can sort this out with Melanie and Jonathan will be found, I&#39;ll get people searching,&#34; he says walking towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And by the way it&#39;s not a choice, you don&#39;t choose who you fall in love with,&#34; Carl states in mock anger while folding his arms at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but she&#39;s not in love with me, I know it&#39;s not a choice,&#34; I say and he smiles at me. I shake my head and look out towards the garden, watching the rain falling heavily onto the grass. &#34;I just don&#39;t think I can deal with all of this,&#34; I say and I feel my eyes start to well. &#34;I don&#39;t want to feel like this,&#34; I say now turning to look at them both. Logan moves towards me and goes to hug me but I push him away from me. I know if he hugs me I&#39;ll crumble but I know that is what I want the most. &#34;Just...&#34; I can&#39;t even finish my sentence which causes him to try again and I don&#39;t have it in me to fight him. His arms wrap around me and then I feel Carl hug me too, both of them resting their head on each of my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll help,&#34; Logan states to me. I don&#39;t even know how they can help me. They can&#39;t take this fear and worry from me and have it themselves, for as long as Jonathan is in this world it&#39;s going to be with me hanging over me like a shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence laces over us and the only sound is from the rain hitting the floor that isn&#39;t sheltered and the pool. Logan&#39;s hands tighten around my neck and Carl&#39;s tighten around my waist. These two are so alike it&#39;s no wonder they&#39;re best friends. Logan has his demons yet is strong because of them. Carl puts on a mask for other people and makes it seem like he hasn&#39;t got a care in the world, but I know he himself most likely has demons of his own that I&#39;ve yet to find out. I only know due to the brief conversations we&#39;ve had and from what Logan has told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know we only need to lose the clothes to make this a threesome,&#34; Carl says breaking the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know,&#34; Logan says pulling away from me and leaning forward to smack the back of Carl&#39;s head. &#34;You&#39;re suck a dick,&#34; he says and I laugh a little and I can&#39;t help but laugh out loud at them as they&#39;re just too comical. The comment Carl has just made is just so like him, he obviously felt awkward being in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I&#39;m just saying, he says with a shrug. &#34;Thought I&#39;d throw it out there,&#34; he say and I laugh more. &#34;Put a smile on her face as I&#39;m sure a threesome would,&#34; he adds and I&#39;m in hysterics as Logan runs out into the rain after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whats going on?&#34; I hear Yasmin say. I turn to see her and Julie both stood there looking at both men running around like school children around the vast garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think?&#34; I ask with a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl said something dirty towards him?&#34; Julie asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I say and watch as Logan grabs him and holds him in the headlock as he walks him towards the pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Carl yells. &#34;It&#39;s freezing I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he shouts. &#34;Megan help me,&#34; he calls out to me. Logan turns and looks at all three of us with Carl in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think we should push them both in?&#34; Yasmin asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I say smiling and walk with her and Julie towards them both. Carl smiles in triumph which makes all three of us run towards them and push them both in. Logan reaches out for me as he starts to fall and I grab hold of Yasmin to stop him from pulling me in but we both end up falling in with them. I let out a scream as my body hits the cold water. I land in the water hitting the bottom of the deep end. I open my eyes and look at Logan and Carl both looking at me and Yasmin. Yasmin surfaces first and then I&#39;m after her with Logan and Carl behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julie stood laughing is all that is heard over the rain and splashes of water. She starts to gloat at the fact she&#39;s the only one not in the pool. I rub the water from my face and look around to see all three of them laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t celebrate too early,&#34; Logan says nodding behind her. I look to see Scott running behind her and then picking her causing her to scream in laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No please,&#34; she says trying to get out of his grasp and him jump into the pool with her in his arms and a shriek coming from her as she hits the cold water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to admit been in the cold water is a lot more enjoyable than I thought. The feeling of the cold his stronger than the feeling of fear. It&#39;s making my mind focus on this rather than what is waiting for me back at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Water gets splashed at me and I look to see who had done it. Logan looks at me and points at Carl. I splash him back and he goes under the water. My eyes widen and I move behind Yasmin, I can see him under the water but not as well as I would be able to if it wasn&#39;t for the rain. I move my arms around Yasmins waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no you don&#39;t, you&#39;re the reason I&#39;m in here,&#34; Yasmin says and goes underwater to swim towards Carl and pull him under. I shake my head at her. She acts like she doesn&#39;t like him but it&#39;s obvious she does. It&#39;s cute really, I guess she likes playing hard to get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I feel arms go around my waist, I jump. I had totally forgotten about Logan and his pursuit of me. I feel him pull at me and I take a breath of air before being pulled under. I close my eyes and then slowly open them to see him looking down at me. He holds his hand out for me and I take it feeling him pull me up from beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inhaling air I nudge him with my hand and he laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should get out or we&#39;ll freeze,&#34; he says while stroking up and down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I personally think we should get in the hottub,&#34; Carl states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has it been cleaned since you were last in it?&#34; Logan asks him and Carl takes on a look of mock horror.</p>
