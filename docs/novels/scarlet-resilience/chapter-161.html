                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon moves his arm around my shoulders as we walk down the beach. When we left home, we made our way to the beach party. Melanie has been in a mood since she caught us kissing the other day at her house. In all honesty, I&#39;m not even bothered by it. I always try to make her happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to tell me why you broke up with Logan?&#34; he asks. He&#39;s been wondering about that since I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I wanted to,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There must be another reason,&#34; he says and sits down on the beach. I look down at him, and I debate on telling him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you want to know?&#34; I ask as I move to sit on him. &#34;If I were still with him, we wouldn&#39;t be here right now,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm very true,&#34; he says as he moves his hands up my thighs. I take my top off, so I&#39;m just in my bikini top. &#34;Maybe we should go back to mine,&#34; he says, looking around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one will see us,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know that, there are weird people everywhere,&#34; he says, and moves his hand down the back of my shorts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I say, and kiss him on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking down the school halls, some of the students are looking at me, and I&#39;m not exactly sure why. Sandra looks at me, and I look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have you done?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I have something on my face?&#34; I ask, and she laughs and shakes her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you hook up with a nerd because people tell me that&#39;s social suicide?&#34; she states, I laugh and shake my head. I get to my locker, and it&#39;s then I know why everyone is staring at me. In bright yellow spray paint someone has painted &#39;HOE&#39; I frown and laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would seem I&#39;m a gardening instrument,&#34; I say, and she laughs. I open my locker to get my books out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you slept with someone&#39;s boyfriend,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe,&#34; I say, and slam my locker shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I notice that students are still looking at me as if they&#39;re waiting for my reaction. Taking a marker pen out of my bag, I turn to look at my locker and Add the &#39;W&#39; and squeeze the &#39;R&#39; between the O and E.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There that&#39;s better,&#34; I say with a smile. &#34;I can&#39;t possibly be a gardening instrument, it&#39;s impossible,&#34; and turn to see Logan looking at me. He shakes his head and walks away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got back last night he wasn&#39;t home, I wasn&#39;t too surprised, but it upset me a little because I know he&#39;s not alone when he goes out for the night. It did make me smile when I woke up in the middle of the night to him, lying next to me. It&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve woken to him holding me. I know it&#39;s selfish of me, but I like it, to know he is still there for me. He doesn&#39;t know I know, he leaves my room before morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night I had one of my worst nightmares, it was just horrible. I woke up when it started to fade, and when I felt his arms around me, I knew it was because of him. He was asleep, which made it easier to cry. I shouldn&#39;t allow it, I should tell him to stop, but I&#39;m selfish, and it&#39;s innocent. It doesn&#39;t help me feel any less for him, it makes me want him back, and in a way, I&#39;m torturing myself but do I not deserve that. I&#39;ve hurt him, and it&#39;s only right I hurt too. My nightmares are my karma, and him chasing them away is bittersweet. That&#39;s a whole new level of torture just for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked into the girl&#39;s toilets to see Courtney standing at the sinks, looking in the mirror while putting some lipstick on. She glances at me and then goes back to what she&#39;s doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look like shit,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; I say, and look in the mirror to see I have bags under my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;d you piss off? She asks and looks at me. &#34;Or should I say whose boyfriend did you sleep with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t you who wrote that?&#34; I was honestly shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I were going to call you a whore, I would do it to your face,&#34; she says, and searches through her make-up bag and then holds a spliff out to me. &#34;So spill,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure,&#34; I say, and frown at her as I take the offering. She pulls a lighter out and lights it for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard you hooked up with Kenneth, so it was probably Mellissa because she&#39;s in love with him or something, the boy doesn&#39;t even look at her,&#34; she says as she opens the window. Then the toilet door opens. She looks to see it&#39;s another student, &#34;Get out,&#34; she snaps. The girl&#39;s eyes widen before she walks out. Then Sandra walks in and glares at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok,&#34; I say. She nods but doesn&#39;t leave. &#34;I didn&#39;t sleep with Kenneth,&#34; I state, she shrugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t really care, so why haven&#39;t I seen you at your therapist&#39;s office? You haven&#39;t signed in that book for weeks,&#34; She says as she takes the spliff from me, and takes a long drag of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I stopped going,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish I could,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you go?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I caught my dad screwing his secretary, so he sent me to a therapist, I think it&#39;s a ploy to make me look crazy if I end up telling my mother,&#34; she says. &#34;I heard your dad isn&#39;t your dad, that&#39;s screwed up,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you hear that?&#34; I ask, and take the spliff from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tyler, the boy, is a chatty fucker after sex, just get up and leave my bed, you know,&#34; she says, and I smile as she&#39;s right. &#34;I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t tell you about me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I tend to kick him out,&#34; I say, she smiles. I take a pull on the spliff and give it back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should do that, I did ask him how you were doing, so it was my own fault for opening up the floor for conversation,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ask about me?&#34; I ask. I notice her hair isn&#39;t as blonde as usual like she stopped getting highlights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We grew up together, I was mortified when your mom died, I cried when I found out, and then all the shit with your dad, sorry uncle, I wanted to come and see you, but then everyone would know I cared for someone other than myself,&#34; she explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fucked up, Courtney,&#34; I say, she laughs and looks at the clock before handing me the spliff back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s easier to let people think you&#39;re a bitch than to let them know you care and hurt you, as you&#39;ve worked out,&#34; she says, and I nod. &#34;Plus losing my brother helped,&#34; I give her a small smile and look down. I remember when that happened, she was so upset; it did change her. That&#39;s when she started cutting me out. &#34;You screwed Mr Peters yet?&#34; she asks, and I choke on the spliff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh please, he&#39;s sex personified, you must have at least thought about it, I know I have. My sister said he broke her bed,&#34; she says, I laugh and look at Sandra to see her smile a little. &#34;He called her the other day,&#34; she looks at me as if she&#39;s trying to gauge my reaction. &#34;Asked her if she wanted to hook up,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s sleeping with a lot of people lately,&#34; I say, and look down at my pale green dress. I pick at imaginary lint as I think of something else to say to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like you,&#34; she says. I look at her. &#34;It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re both going through heartbreak,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you getting at?&#34; She chuckles and shakes her head at me before taking the spliff from my fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not stupid, Megan, I know you, we used to be best friends. I may come off stupid most of the time, but I see more than you think,&#34; she states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about,&#34; I say, she smirks at me and her blue eyes take me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, but if you ever want to talk about it, let me know. I&#39;ve always kept your secrets, and this one I&#39;ve kept for a long time,&#34; she states. &#34;Maybe you and my sister can share notes,&#34; she says with a little giggle. I sigh and look away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing to talk about,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want another?&#34; she asks as she pulls another spliff out of her make-up bag. I&#39;m starting to think that bag has no make-up in it. I look at the clock to see there are ten minutes until 1st period starts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on then,&#34; I say and watch her light it with the one in her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember that sub we had in Math last month?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I say as she hands me the new joint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I screwed him,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you didn&#39;t,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did, subs are easy because the chances of seeing them again are low, it&#39;s the best, plus they&#39;re less likely to take another shift at the school out of fear of being caught,&#34; she says and sits on the window ledge. I sit next to her and look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Courtney has always been beautiful, and she knows it, and so does everyone else, it helps that she does a bit of modelling on the side, but if I remember correctly, she only does it because her mother makes her. She&#39;s the girl most girls want to be and the type of girl to get by on her looks alone. She&#39;s about the same height as me and looks like a victoria secret model. I&#39;m not sure why she stays single. She could have any guy she wants, and I&#39;m not sure who she likes anymore.</p>
