                <p>Megan walks down the stairs in a pair of skinny jeans, a grey vest top with a green flannel shirt. I smile a little as I watch her text on her phone as she walks down. She hadn&#39;t eaten anything this morning and she barely spoke to anyone. I am worried for her first day back since everything; I was even more worried now seeing as she had a nightmare last night which put her in this mood today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All set?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stops texting and looks at me as she stands in front of me. A small smile forms on her lips and she leans up to kiss me &#34;Yeah,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that for?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No reason,&#34; she said and closed her phone and put it in her back pocket. Her hands move around me &#34;we could stay home today and go to school tomorrow,&#34; she states and leans up to kiss me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We could but we aren&#39;t,&#34; I said and moved my hands to her neck. I lean in and kiss her on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just,&#34; she starts before kissing me back &#34;really don&#39;t want to go back today; can&#39;t I go back tomorrow when I feel more up to it? Because the nightmare last night has just really...&#34; She trails off and looks away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything will be ok,&#34; I said and leaned in to kiss her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urgh get a room,&#34; we hear Julie say. I pull back from Megan, hug her tightly and look at Julie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I sense jealousy in that voice of yours Julie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I sense a relationship that shouldn&#39;t be a relationship?&#34; she asks and I slowly move my arms from around Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll wait in the car,&#34; I said and walked out of the house, shutting the front door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to,&#34; she said loudly. I smile a little and walk towards my new car. Her grandfather had bought me a BMW when I got out of the hospital. I have no idea why. He said something about repaying me for helping Megan out. I really did not understand his logic in that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Climbing into the car I shut the door behind me and leaned back. I sigh knowing that what Julie said was right we shouldn&#39;t be in a relationship and we were bound to get caught, that was a risk I was willing to take. I love her and she may not know it yet but I wasn&#39;t going to stop seeing her just because someone tells me to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her walk out of the house with her new school bag on her arm. She ran round the car and got in the passenger seat and then she looks at me with a smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did something good happen?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I just finally get to spend five minutes with my boyfriend without getting interrupted,&#34; she said and I smiled a little, taking her hand in mine. &#34;I would much rather not go to school,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said and looked her in the eyes, her emerald green eyes showing me that she wasn&#39;t as happy as she was portraying to everyone. She hadn&#39;t gone back to sleep last night like she said she would. I could feel her tossing and turning all the time. At one point she got up and went down stairs and when I was about to get up to go see what she was doing but she returned just as I got up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today wasn&#39;t going to go smoothly, just by looking at her I could tell she was going to find today hard. I lean towards her and give her a quick kiss. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about today, ok,&#34; I state, she sighs at me and looks away rolling her. &#34;Don&#39;t say you&#39;re not worried when you are, just because you&#39;ve put on a face in front of them doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not going to notice,&#34; I said and she turned to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan, can we not?&#34; she asks. I sigh and move my arms around her waist and pull her towards me. &#34;I&#39;m fine, honest. Yes I had quite the nightmare last night but I&#39;m fine,&#34; she said trying to reassure me. I pull her onto my lap and kiss her on the lips, she moves so she&#39;s straddling me and pulls back. &#34;I&#39;m ok, honest,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok I&#39;ll shut up,&#34; I said and leaned in to kiss her again. After a few minutes I moved her off me onto the passenger seat. She huffs and folds her arms at me. I smirk and lean forward and peck her lips &#34;we have school,&#34; I said and she puts on her seatbelt. I turn and watch Julie and Melanie walk towards the car. They climb in the back and put their seatbelts on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you two done necking?&#34; Julie asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Megan said &#34;while he&#39;s driving we&#39;re going to do it,&#34; she said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said slowly &#34;Let&#39;s just go shall we,&#34; I stated and start to drive them to school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Parking at the school I watch Melanie and Julie climb out, I then turn to Megan to see her staring at the school. I move my hand into hers and she turns to look at me and smiles a little and takes her hand out of mine. She takes a deep breath and opens the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a meeting first,&#34; I state. She nods and I climb out of the car and walk behind her, locking the car. I raise an eyebrow as I watch her walk up the steps to the school. The jeans she is wearing fit her much better now actually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; she said and moving my gaze from her bottom to her head I smiled a little &#34;thank you,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm I don&#39;t see eyes at the back of your head,&#34; I said under my breath and looked around to see there were hardly any students in the hallway in fact there were none. She stops and I walk to the side of her. I look down and she looks up at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pervert,&#34; she said under her breath &#34;and we are way too early,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you rather we&#39;re late so the halls are filled with students?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she said, shaking her head and folds her arms. &#34;What&#39;s this meeting about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You,&#34; I said and walked with her to the main office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting in a seat next to Logan I watch as all the other teachers walk in the head teacher sitting at the head of the table which meant I was next to her. I look down at my lap as they start their meeting. I really did not want to be here but it seems it has to be done. The teachers seemed like they were feeling as awkward as I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the head say my name. I look at the brown haired woman with her new high and low lights and gulp down my nerves, her green eyes scanning me. I give her a small wave and a barely there smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; I said quietly and look back down at my lap</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you?&#34; she asks as if she had asked me for the second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never better,&#34; I said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know this may be awkward for you but,&#34; she moves her hand onto my hands and I move my hand away and I notice the look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; I say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No don&#39;t be,&#34; she says. I sigh and look at Logan to see him shrug at me and yawn while moving his hand over his mouth. &#34;Ok,&#34; she sighs, &#34;where to start? I had a conversation with your grandfather and your psychologist,&#34; I sigh and look at her&#34;. She didn&#39;t tell me anything, don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s not allowed to. She made that very clear, but because of how many sessions you have a week we have set up a time and day for when you can have one of your sessions here,&#34; she explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joy,&#34; I said quietly and I notice Logan look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea,&#34; he states causing her to frown at what he said &#34;in fact I know it&#39;s not a good idea,&#34; he states &#34;after her sessions she&#39;s not exactly a barrel of laughs,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; I said quietly. He looks at me and I sigh knowing he&#39;s right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh ok,&#34; she said and looks at me &#34;would you rather have it how it is?&#34; she asks. I shrug my shoulders &#34;It&#39;s up to you Megan not us,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Erm,&#34; I look at Logan to see him picking his nails &#34;Erm yeah,&#34; I said and look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok then, we want you to know that we&#39;re all here for you, ok?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; I said and look down at my lap for some reason being outside in the hallways seemed so much more appealing right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After half an hour of going through my school schedule and what was going to be put in place for me to have a &#39;healthy school experience&#39; yes that is the term they used. They also spoke about if I got any trouble from any students or if I ever felt uncomfortable in class. It was ok for me to excuse myself as long as I explained why I felt uncomfortable to the teacher.</p>
