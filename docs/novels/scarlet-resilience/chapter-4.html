                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t been this nervous in my life. I wasn&#39;t going to tell Megan who Stephanie was, I was too scared to. They would most likely get on but Megan was very distant from people at the moment and she hardly said anything to anyone. I would be lucky if I heard more than a hundred words from her in a day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we going?&#34; she asked me after a few minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To go see a friend of mine, you&#39;ll like her,&#34; I said quietly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat in the chair beside Stephanie&#39;s bed watching Megan as she made no I contact with anyone. Stephanie on the other hand was just laid staring at her and every now and then her eyes would drift to me. I had introduced them but still they never spoke. It didn&#39;t feel like an awkward silence to me as I was used to silence when I was around Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stephanie sighs slightly and turned her attention back to Megan &#34;so you feeling like shit?&#34; she asks her. I rolled my eyes slightly; trust her to say what&#39;s on her mind. Megan didn&#39;t say anything she just looked at her head on and then laid her head back while closing her eyes. She had being in pain ever since she woke up and she was most likely in pain now just wasn&#39;t saying anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; I ask  her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just tired,&#34; she mumbled and looked at Stephanie. Megan sighs while looking at her analyzing her slightly. &#34;You&#39;re on a life support machine,&#34; Megan stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I, ohmigod I so totally didn&#39;t know they told me it was just there for show those damn doctors always lying to me,&#34; Stephanie said with a small smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan smirked slightly and then her facial features went back into the cold look &#34;Why?&#34; Megan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some accident,&#34; Stephanie lied &#34;I heard what happened to you that pretty sucks to be honest,&#34; she states &#34;but hey at least you&#39;re alive,&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm,&#34; Megan hummed slightly and started to yawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a quiet one,&#34; Stephanie stated and she got no reply from Megan, &#34;you got a boyfriend?&#34; she asks. Megan shrugged her shoulders which made me frown slightly and I saw Stephanie look at me and smirk slightly at the corner of my eye. &#34;What do you mean you don&#39;t know?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean I don&#39;t know I could have one if I wanted or I could not it really depends if I want one or not, I know he&#39;ll go back out with me and I know he&#39;ll accept it if I say I don&#39;t want a boyfriend,&#34; Megan mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh you have a back up,&#34; Stephanie said with a smile &#34;I had a back up,&#34; my head shot at her my eyes wide &#34;he was called Carl,&#34; My jaw nearly came off my head. &#34;But I&#39;d probably catch something off him so I decided to keep my distance,&#34; I frowned and looked down. I suddenly didn&#39;t want to be in this room anymore. My ego felt battered and bruised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not a back up,&#34; Megan stated &#34;he&#39;s a soon to be ex that is going to stay an ex,&#34; she muttered and moved her hand over eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; Stephanie said and looked back at me then back at her &#34;are you ok?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Megan said letting out a long breath &#34;I&#39;m just tired,&#34; she states still not looking up from her lap and her hand hiding her eyes. I moved to her and moved her hair out of the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I ask  quietly. She stayed silent for a moment and then spoke &#34;and please don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re just tired,&#34; I cut in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34; she muttered. I sigh slightly and looked towards Stephanie to see her smiling slightly while looking at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get a nurse to take you back to your room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice meeting you,&#34; Stephanie stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm you too,&#34; Megan said quietly still in the same position she was in a few minute ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I had taken Megan to the nurse I walked back to Stephanie. I sat down back in my seat and gave her a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s nice,&#34; Stephanie said. I frowned slightly wondering if she was telling me the truth &#34;she is, I like her obviously she&#39;s a little withdrawn but she seems ok,&#34; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm and I don&#39;t know what to do she hardly talks just now was probably the most she&#39;s spoken to someone since she woke except for the little arguments she&#39;s had with me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah about them do you blame her she obviously has some feelings for you and you&#39;re sort of disabled at the moment because of her father, she&#39;s going to obviously see that as her fault and going to be angry at herself but seen as she can&#39;t shout at herself  you&#39;re the next person she can shout at that she thinks will tell her that she&#39;s wrong,&#34; Stephanie paused &#34;you&#39;re probably the only person who won&#39;t stand there and give her a sympathetic look, she probably hates that look right now,&#34; Stephanie explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh slightly as I did see her point and she was most likely to be right. &#34;I&#39;m going to go, I&#39;ll be back later,&#34; I state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard her sigh slightly and I knew why it was because I was putting off turning her life support machine off.  I don&#39;t think she realised how hard it is for me to do that, I love her just as much as I love Megan and I&#39;ve known her for so long and coming to this hospital to come and see her every few days is natural for me to do it feels normal, but once she&#39;s gone I&#39;ll have nothing to fill that void.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh and Logan,&#34; she called. I stopped and looked at her &#34;tell her that what she is doing won&#39;t change what&#39;s happened it&#39;ll just make everything worse,&#34; she states. I frowned slightly and nodded an OK at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few minutes, she stopped outside Megan&#39;s room to see she wasn&#39;t there. I frowned and looked around for some nurses when I saw the one I had let bring her up here. I limped over with my crutch and caught her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The girl I ask  you to bring up here in the wheelchair where did you take her,&#34; I ask  &#34;because she&#39;s not in her room,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wanted to go see her dad so I let her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I ask not fully sure she says what I thought she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She says her dad was in this hospital somewhere but she wasn&#39;t sure where because her memory was fuzzy so I looked her dad up on the computer and I took her to his room,&#34; she states &#34;Why is there a problem?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a breath trying to calm myself down after all it wasn&#39;t the nurse&#39;s fault she was so fucking stupid. I turned and started my way to her father&#39;s room. The whole way to her father&#39;s room was telling myself to calm down but I couldn&#39;t understand why the hell she still wanted to visit him after what happened after I told her she didn&#39;t need him. Why wouldn&#39;t she just trust me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan sat in her wheelchair at the foot of her father&#39;s bed glaring at him. He did not try to make any eye contact; he was sitting up and looking down at his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; he asks quietly, breaking the silence that had laced over them over the past seven minutes. He got no reply from her &#34;Please Megan you shouldn&#39;t be here you should be as far away from me as possible,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan stayed silent, her eyes just watching every movement he made as he spoke. She watched him inhale a big breath and let it out again while closing his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve just woken from your coma,&#34;he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t have children,&#34; Megan suddenly said. His eyes snapped towards her &#34;because of you I can&#39;t have children,&#34; He gulped as he watched her eyes fill with water &#34;because of you I&#39;m terrified to sleep, because of fucking you I can&#39;t feel anything but dirt all the time,&#34; she yelled at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door then opened and Logan walked in. He walked straight towards her and knelt down hugging her. She slowly moved her arms around him, hugging him back and crying into his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m going to make sure I get punished properly. People are telling me to plead insanity but I&#39;m not going to because I need to be punished,&#34; her father said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please get me out of here Logan,&#34; she muttered. Logan nodded and got up and moved behind her and started to push her out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry sweetheart,&#34; Jonathon said before she left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop a minute,&#34; Megan said. Logan reluctantly stopped her &#34;I hate you don&#39;t ever call me sweetheart or anything as you are nothing to me,&#34; she snarled and Logan wheeled her out of the room and shut the door behind him.</p>
