                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking down the halls, I hear a piano playing, it&#39;s most likely Carl although this sounds a bit too good to be Carl, he&#39;s better at the Guitar. As I walk closer to his classroom I hear singing also. A female voice. I get to his classroom to see Megan sat at the piano. I&#39;ve not seen her play in so long. She told me she doesn&#39;t as she didn&#39;t want to once her mother died and wasn&#39;t allowed to when she did want to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at her bodyguard to see her smile a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s good,&#34; she whispers. I nod and watch as she slowly ends the song.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You enjoyed that,&#34; Carl states with a big smile and Megan shrugs in response. &#34;Play another,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more,&#34; Megan agrees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know the song very well that she plays but I do hope it&#39;s not about me. I look behind me to notice some of the students that were still milling about had stopped to listen. Even Mrs Kitson the principal had stopped, it looks like she was in the middle of a discussion. Turning back to Megan I walk in a little and lean against the door. She has such a powerful voice, it amazes me that she hides it so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The song finishes and Carl grins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know if you can act too I can make you a Disney star,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;m too old to be a Disney star,&#34; she says with a small laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was amazing,&#34; he states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s true,&#34; I say, and she turns with a jump. I smile at her and look out of the room. &#34;I think many would agree,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh god,&#34; She says, putting her head in her hands. &#34;Never again am I doing this,&#34; Carl laughs, sitting next to her to nudge her in the shoulder. I watch as her ears turn a bright shade of pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to get you, Carl,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok honey,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh, I think every student in the school thinks I&#39;m gay or bisexual now thanks to Carl. I mean I&#39;m not complaining, it&#39;s just made students who wouldn&#39;t normally give me much attention now do. I&#39;m also pretty sure many of the students believe him and now apparently ship us together whatever that means. I roll my eyes and look at Megan to see her smiling a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past couple of weeks she seems happier, I think the training with David helps her get some of her frustrations out. He did tell me she&#39;s annoyed that she doesn&#39;t get to spend any time with me. I wonder if she knows how annoying it is for me too. It&#39;s worse when I walk in on her training and she&#39;s wearing small shorts and a sports bra. I contemplate walking back out and straight into a cold shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sandra&#39;s driving you back isn&#39;t she?&#34; I ask Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve just got to do a few things and then I&#39;ll be back, ok?&#34; She nods in response and looks at Sandra.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan hadn&#39;t come back until late last night, I tried staying awake but I was too tired. David wasn&#39;t home when I got home so we didn&#39;t end up training. I decided to just play games on the PlayStation with my uncle. Strangely, I beat him at &#39;Call of Duty&#39;. I found it quite funny. He didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We then ordered a pizza because we didn&#39;t think it was fair for Lorraine to cook for just us two. After that we watched a movie, it feels a little like old times, when he would look after me while mom and dad went out on a date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m sat downstairs in the kitchen, I&#39;d had another nightmare. Logan&#39;s home, I went to go into his room but remembered I can&#39;t. So I decided to just come downstairs and not wake him up. It&#39;s difficult, I feel safe most of the time, but only when I&#39;m at home or school. Any other time and I just get this crippling fear. When I went shopping with the girls for the party that I didn&#39;t end up going to, I came home after half an hour. They understood but it&#39;s just difficult. I&#39;m technically trapped between home and school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fill my water bottle up and then get up to go to the gym. May as well try and train, it will take my mind off of my nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about an hour I feel someone watching me. I look to see Logan sat on one of the benches in just a pair of dark bottoms. I take my earphones out and walk over to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long have you been here?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About five minutes,&#34; he states, and holds my towel out to me. I take it and dab at the sweat on my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess security told you I was awake,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I heard you leave my room,&#34; he states, &#34;I waited for you to come back but you didn&#39;t,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah well, it&#39;s not like I can just climb into your bed,&#34; I snap and reach for my water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s hardly my fault,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I say quietly and I can&#39;t help but blame him a little. It&#39;s not like he tries to have any time with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon I&#39;ll train with you,&#34; he says standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, but if I kick your ass I&#39;m telling David,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you kick my ass you can put it in the newspaper,&#34; he says with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We warm-up for about ten minutes when I get a little frustrated. I&#39;m angry at him, for ignoring my texts, and yeah making me so goddamn sexually frustrated. He walks around the house dressed like this most days and it&#39;s hell. The other day he spilt a drop of milk on his chest and if there hadn&#39;t been other people in the room I think I would have jumped over the counter and licked it off him. I told my therapist this and she burst out laughing. Even the girls laughed at me. It&#39;s like my lack of a sex life is funny to everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sometimes think it would have been better if we had never slept together. Then I wouldn&#39;t know what it was like. He&#39;s a tease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell,&#34; he says as he just barely missed a kick to the head. He sidesteps my foot and grabs my leg to make me hop on one foot. &#34;Are you trying to knock me out?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I say innocently. He pulls on my leg making me press against his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what?&#34; he asks while holding my leg at his hip. I gulp and look up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m angry at you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a pussy tease,&#34; I snap and he blinks a couple of times. &#34;Walking around with yourself on show, with your goddamn accent and bed head hair,&#34; I pause &#34;if I knew this is what sexual frustration felt like, I wouldn&#39;t have slept with you,&#34; I snap and he&#39;s grinning the entire time I say this to him. &#34;What&#39;s so funny,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think I like this?&#34; he asks. He picks up my other leg and I wrap my arms around his neck. &#34;I get a boner every time you walk into a room,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not just that though, I&#39;ve not spent any time with you either,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is my fault,&#34; he says, and it&#39;s only when my back touches the wall that I realised he&#39;d carried me to here. &#34;I figured if I tried not to be alone with you for too long it would help,&#34; he states, and then presses his lips to mine. He pulls back a little too quickly for my liking &#34;it didn&#39;t,&#34; he states, and presses himself against my core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leans forward and kisses my neck, I look towards the door to see it&#39;s closed, I sigh in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I locked it when I came in,&#34; he states in my ear and I smile a little before pressing my lips to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pouring my second cup of coffee I yawn and then hold the mug to my nose to sniff it. I may be tired but I feel in such a better mood. To say we just fooled around would be a lie and to say we only had sex once would also be a lie. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to look at the bench press apparatus the same again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sit at the kitchen table and lay my head on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; I hear Carl say. I looked up to see him walk in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan and I had to sneak back upstairs in the early hours of this morning because my uncle was already up ready to go into the gym. We hid under the stairs where David then found us five minutes later after Logan banged his elbow on the door. This resulted in me making a quick exit as I felt myself turning red from embarrassment. I got a long shower and then came down here. I&#39;ve been here for about an hour, trying to keep myself awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you get no sleep?&#34; Carl asks as he sits down next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I had a nightmare,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, well if you dream about me you won&#39;t,&#34; he states, and I lift my head to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, I&#39;ll remember next time,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then my uncle walks in. He looks at me and gives me a small smile before pouring himself some cereal and sitting on the other side of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have you got planned today then peanut?&#34; he asks me. I smile a little as he hasn&#39;t called me that in a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Netflix,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you go to the mall or something with what&#39;s her name?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Melanie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah her and that ginger one,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yasmin, no I don&#39;t feel like it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve not been out with your friends since I arrived,&#34; he states, and at that moment Logan walks in pouring himself the same big bowl of cereal as my uncle. My uncle watches him. &#34;I&#39;m guessing you two went out last night then and you pulled?&#34; he says to Logan. I choke on my coffee and Logan looks at him. &#34;The scratches on your back,&#34; he states, and Carl looks and then laughs a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Err yeah,&#34; Logan says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was she good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god,&#34; I say, getting up. &#34;Not a conversation I need to hear,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t want to know,&#34; Logan says, and my uncle just laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That good eh,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll invite my friends over,&#34; I say to my uncle and walk out of the kitchen to the sound of Carl laughing.</p>
