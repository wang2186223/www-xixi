                <p>**Megan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I unbuckle his jeans as we enter. Sitting me on my dresser, his hands cup my face as he looks at me. He has the bluest eyes that see right down to my soul. It makes me wonder if he knew how I felt before I did, but the look on his face when I said those three words tell me he didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kissing down my neck, I feel his hand move under the skirt of my dress. I pull on his t-shirt, I don&#39;t want foreplay, I want him inside of me. No one knows my body like he does. He takes his t-shirt off while I unzip his jeans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; I moan as he snaps the straps of my dress, making the top half pool around my waist, revealing my braless torso. Pulling him closer to me, I feel his large erection press against my covered core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands move down to my thighs, he lifts one of my legs and pulls me closer to him. I wrap my arms around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, I need to be inside you,&#34; he says in my ear as he thrusts against my core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; is all I can say because I need him too. Moving my panties to the side, I feel the tip of his cock move along my slit, and then he&#39;s inside me in one hard thrust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck,&#34; he groans, expressing the word that came to my mind at the feel of him. He pulls out and then thrust harder, making me moan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, god,&#34; I pant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, you feel good,&#34; his thrusts become quicker and harder, I can feel my orgasm building. He leans back a little and looks down at our joining. Moving my hands from holding onto my vanity mirror, I caress down his chest, and then up to his neck. He looks up at me, &#34;Tell me again,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you,&#34; with each word he moves into me hitting the right spot. My orgasm flows through me, making my walls tighten around his cock. Drawing him to his climax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan presses his lips to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After catching our breath, he steps away from me and pulls on my dress and panties, pulling them both off at the same time. I stand in front of him; he tilts his head as he looks at the red outline of a heart tattoo on my hip. He strokes it and then looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you get this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two weeks after we broke up, I was drunk, could have gotten something a lot worse,&#34; I say, and he chuckles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes you could have, I like it,&#34; he says and crouches down to move his arms around my thighs to lift me, to then drop me on my bed. He looks down at me, and he honestly makes me feel like I&#39;m the sexiest woman on the planet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch him push his jeans down his legs, displaying his beautiful naked body. His penis is rock hard already, and I want to pleasure him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving forward, I crawl towards him. He watches me through lustful eyes. Seeing him looking at me like that in all of his nakedness turns me on even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look up at him as I lick up his length. He bites his bottom lip and watches as I tease his tip with my tongue. Taking him in my hand, I guide him into my mouth. He takes in a shaky breath as I take him as far as I can. Slowly I pull back, hollowing my cheeks in the process. His hand moves through my hair as I repeat the process, quickening my pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling back, I lick down his shaft to his balls. I give each one a little lick and suck the skin of each before licking up to his tip. A small bead of liquid comes to the surface. I twirl my tongue over the end of his cock, tasting the saltiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look up at him as I move my hand up and down his length, his balls feel hot to the touch, and I know he&#39;s close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m close,&#34; he says to me and hearing the pleasure in his voice makes me wet. I honestly enjoy pleasuring him. It gets me off knowing I do this to him. That he&#39;s going to come because of me, he usually stops me because he wants to pleasure me as he comes but this time he doesn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pull away from him and lay back on the bed. He looks down at me and raises an eyebrow as a small smirk plays on his delicious lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My turn,&#34; he says and grabs my legs to pull me to the edge of the bed. His head is buried between my legs before I can even think about what he just said. I moan as his hot mouth sucks on my clit. His fingers move inside of me; I move my hand onto my mouth to stifle my moans. He pulls away and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one will hear,&#34; he says as he moves his fingers in and out of me and uses his thumb to circle my clit. I try to calm my body before I speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brett will,&#34; is all I can manage before I moan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s out, he said he was going to Vegas with some friends,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; is all I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got a gag if you&#39;re disappointed,&#34; my eyes widen a little and notice he&#39;s smirking at me and that isn&#39;t a joke. &#34;Or would you prefer a blindfold,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m good for now,&#34; I say, and I know I&#39;m blushing. He chuckles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or handcuffs?&#34; and now I know he&#39;s saying it directly to embarrass me. &#34;I think having you handcuffed and blindfolded would be the hottest thing I&#39;ve ever laid my eyes on,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;d prefer the idea of you being handcuffed and blindfolded,&#34; I retaliate, and he tilts his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that a promise?&#34; he asks. I giggle and stroke up and down my leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only if you&#39;re promising,&#34; I counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckles and kisses down the inside of my thigh. The truth is, I wouldn&#39;t mind exploring my sexuality a little more. I&#39;ve heard of BDSM, and I know what it consists of. Some of it scares me; I know there are some things I definitely don&#39;t want to try. It makes me wonder what he likes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t lying to Courtney when I said that Logan is an expert in oral. If I compare him to the other people I&#39;ve slept with, there&#39;s no contest in all aspects.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running my hand through his hair, I feel my body tingle as the pleasure builds from my core throughout my body. I pull on his hair when I reach my climax, as his tongue twirls my clit and his fingers pump into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh fuck, Logan,&#34; I scream. I feel my body rise and fall as the after affects buzz through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He takes my hand from his hair and slowly pushes my legs open to kiss up my body. I feel him nibble at my tattoo before making his way up my body, stopping to pay attention to my breasts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting my body, he moves me up the bed and slowly pushes his penis into my core. I open my eyes and moan as his thick cock stretches me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem to have the stamina of a horse,&#34; I say between kisses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do this to me,&#34; he says and then pulls back and looks down at me. I whimper at the loss of him inside me. &#34;You make me horny,&#34; I shake my head at him. &#34;Let&#39;s try a different position,&#34; he says and moves me onto my stomach. &#34;If you don&#39;t like it say so,&#34; he tells me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I can dislike any position with you,&#34; I state and feel him lift my hips, it&#39;s then I realise what he wants to try. I&#39;ve done this position once, and I didn&#39;t like it, for some reason I had some flashbacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting on all fours, I feel his hands on my bum. He moves both of my hands onto my headboard and then strokes down my back. His cock pushes into me slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax,&#34; he says. I hadn&#39;t realised I&#39;d tensed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; I whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be, if you&#39;re not comfortable we can stop,&#34; he says, making me smile a little. He&#39;s so sweet to me even after everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok, I am,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He starts to thrust into me slowly at first. This feels so much deeper, with how big he is, I didn&#39;t think he could get any deeper, but I guess I was wrong. The pleasure builds faster this time, making me push back onto him to make him go faster. He does. He moves his hands to the front of my body, caressing my breasts and squeezing my nipples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking behind me, I see him watching himself, he looks up, and he smiles as if I had caught him doing something he shouldn&#39;t. I giggle and feel one hand move down to my core; he circles my clit with his fingers. He moves his other hand up to my throat and then leans in and kisses me; his tongue pushes into my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harder, Logan, please,&#34; I breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; and it comes out as more of a moan. He does as I ask. My body feels like it&#39;s on fire as my orgasm overcomes me. He continues his pace, and the feel of him heightens inside of me. &#34;Yes, Logan, oh god, I&#39;m gonna come,&#34; he moves faster and harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I orgasm like in England, he thrusts one more time, and I feel his climax. He presses his head on my shoulder and pulls me onto him as he moves back. I move my hand behind me to his hair as I try my best to get my breath back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should get a shower,&#34; I say between breaths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, just give me a minute,&#34; I smile and feel him kiss the nape of my neck, &#34;together?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we do what I want, we won&#39;t be leaving this bedroom for the rest of the year,&#34; he states. &#34;Especially not after that, I love it when you come like that,&#34; I feel myself blush and shakily get myself off him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It only happens with you,&#34; I confess as I stand at the side of the bed. He looks at me and frowns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think my ego has just grown,&#34; I laugh and stagger into the bathroom. My walking wasn&#39;t great before we had sex; my legs are like jelly now.</p>
