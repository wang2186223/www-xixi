                <p>&#34;Oh maybe she doesn&#39;t want to remember,&#34; she said while smiling a little. &#34;Think about it Logan, her love has been used against her by the one person she&#39;s supposed to have all her trust in, by the one person that is supposed to keep her from harm. She won&#39;t want to love and she won&#39;t want people to love her, she&#39;ll see love as a bad thing,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what are you saying? I need to prove to her it&#39;s not?&#34; I ask. She shrugs her shoulders &#34;You are,&#34; I mumble as I look back up at the ceiling &#34;I can&#39;t because I don&#39;t know how to and well she shuts me out every time I get too close, she only ever tells me what she&#39;s really thinking when she&#39;s drunk,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well obviously,&#34; she mutters, &#34;you sometimes have the brain of a five year old,&#34; she said and then rubbed her eyes &#34;do you not see something here at all?&#34; she asks. I raised my eyebrows &#34;she&#39;s like a girl version of you when you were her age, you were exactly like her, granted you haven&#39;t gone through what she&#39;s gone through but she&#39;s doing what you did, rebelling, hers might be slow but you have to do something before she becomes too much for anyone to handle,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh &#34;You said in one of my sessions no one is like anyone,&#34; I said with a small smirk while looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well no one is, everyone is unique but Megan is just rebelling,&#34; she pause &#34;I should know what rebelling is I have two children doing it now,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you mean out there anyway?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan and my son are close,&#34; she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean close?&#34; I ask, as my eyebrows knit together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just close, he&#39;s like an older brother to her...sometimes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean sometimes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop changing the subject,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Logan, it&#39;s up to Megan,&#34; she said &#34;now tell me how you&#39;re coping with Stephanie&#39;s death, I know her funeral is on Sunday,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, I guess,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I hissed. She raises her eyebrows and then writes something down. I sigh and start telling her how I felt.</p>

                <p>Jonathon sits in the steel chair. He&#39;s wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and his hands and feet are cuffed. He has lost a dramatic amount of weight which has caused him to look gaunt and almost skeletal. A man in a grey suit with glasses sits opposite him in the same steel chair. Two police officers were also situated in the dark gloomy room, one at the door and one behind Jonathon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your father sent me,&#34; the man in the grey suit said, looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need you,&#34; he hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want a shorter sentence you do,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want a shorter sentence,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you plead guilty the judge may be lenient and it&#39;s best to claim insanity because you&#39;re obviously not sane,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you not hear me?&#34; he asks. &#34;I am not doing any of those things, I will plead not guilty and I will not claim insanity,&#34; he pauses &#34;I know what I have done but I am still not pleading guilty, the longer the better,&#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said that now but,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But nothing,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know who&#39;s in there?&#34; he asks. Jonathon frowns &#34;Marcus, the guy who took you and made you the way you are, he&#39;s in there,&#34; the grey suited man snaps. Jonathon&#39;s eyes widen and then he looks down &#34;And you know as well as I do what he&#39;s planning, I have the letters here in case you have forgotten,&#34;he said moving several pieces of paper in front of Jonathon. Jonathon looks away, his eyes glazing over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I deserve whatever comes to me,&#34;he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They will asses you anyway and determine themselves whether you are sane or not,&#34;  he pauses &#34;why do you think they haven&#39;t given you your medication for so long, they are assessing you as we speak,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well they can go fuck themselves,&#34; Jonathon mutters. &#34;Do you have any idea who you&#39;re defending and what I have done,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, it&#39;s sick boohoo don&#39;t really care to be honest, you weren&#39;t in the right state of mind through all of it, what you did to your daughter Megan is not your fault,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Megs,&#34; Jonathon mutters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; he asks. The guards looked at each other and then took out their batons. The guard near the door made his way out and shut the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want my Megs,&#34; he said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jonathon do you not realise what will happen to you in there with Marcus in there too,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand I will see my dad,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; he asks confused and then turned once he heard the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A middle aged man with glasses and grey hair walks in. He was a short man compared to Jonathon but was a slimmer build. He was more on the scrawny side of things. He wore a dark blue suit and stood with his shoulders back and a warm smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Benjamin,&#34;he said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Piss off,&#34; he hisses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it just you I am going to see today or am I going to see the others?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What others?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, how about Harry? Have you spoken to Harry lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harry is dead,&#34; he muttered. &#34;Where&#39;s Megs?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hurt her so she&#39;s not going to see you anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not hurt her,&#34; he yelled &#34;it was that teacher, it&#39;s because of him, it&#39;s all him,&#34; he yells &#34;He made Megs not love me anymore,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did that Benjamin,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I didn&#39;t, I showed her love,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you didn&#39;t you hurt her,&#34; he pauses &#34;she nearly died Benjamin,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...That wasn&#39;t me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t it?&#34; he asks as he tells the lawyer to move from the chair. The lawyer frowns but stands &#34;get him out of here please,&#34; he orders one of the police officers and the one stood at the door escorted the lawyer out. &#34;Who was it?&#34; he asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34;he says, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Harry and Jonathon?&#34; he asks him &#34;eh Benjamin?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I killed them,&#34;he said with a small smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Strangled them, they won&#39;t bother me anymore, Harry was easy, Jonathon put up a fight but I did it,&#34;he says, still smirking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you kill them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They wanted Megs for themselves,&#34; he said frowning &#34;she&#39;s mine no one else&#39;s,&#34;he said and looked the man in the eyes &#34;that teacher is next and whoever else wants to get in between our love for each other,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megs doesn&#39;t love you though,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She does she even said so and we have made love, she loves me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You forced her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I didn&#39;t,&#34; he snaps and bangs his hand on the table &#34;she likes it like that she even told me herself,&#34; he yells.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s your daughter though,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No she isn&#39;t,&#34; he yells &#34;She is my love,&#34;he said now standing up. The guards moved towards him and the grey haired man held his hand up to stop them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she really?&#34; he asks. Benjamin frowned &#34;what was the last thing she said to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin sat down &#34;but I showed her the love I was shown,&#34;he said frowning and looking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You weren&#39;t shown love,&#34; The man stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know nothing,&#34; he yells and launches himself over the table. The guards run towards him dragging him off the grey haired man. Benjamin kicks and yells for them to let go of him and then starts shouting &#39;Megs&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He needs sectioning,&#34; The man said standing up &#34;he&#39;s not mentally stable, I feared this would have happened,&#34; he said more to himself &#34;Jonathon phoned me just a little too late,&#34; he said quietly and takes off his glasses to clean them. He then walks out of the room to be in a hallway. He looks at Jonathon&#39;s father and then at a nurse &#34;Phone me when Jonathon returns, I wish to speak to him,&#34; he said and then looked at</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonathon&#39;s dad. &#34;You may want to prepare your granddaughter because he could be out within six month,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not stable and he will be hospitalised but if he goes to prison there is a chance he may not get his medication inside as other inmates are known to take the medication, also his life is in danger at the prison.&#34; He pauses &#34;He will be hospitalised but he may be let out afterwards, it will depend on the judge and the case details,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighs and nods &#34;I will,&#34; he mumbles and runs his hands through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a difficult situation,&#34; he mumbles to himself and puts his glasses back on &#34;you may want to sedate him young lady,&#34;he said to the nurse. She nodded and walked to the nurse&#39;s station and the man walked down the corridor.</p>
