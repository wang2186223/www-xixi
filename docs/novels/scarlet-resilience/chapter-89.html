                <p>Logan moves his arm over my shoulders as I sit next to him with a bucket of popcorn. I put the popcorn on his lap, he puts it on the seat next to him and takes his jacket off. He moves his arm back around my shoulders and kisses my cheek. I turn to look at him to see him smile pull me close to him. I turn and watch Melanie sit down next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Cade?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t care,&#34; she said harshly and I smile at her. &#34;He&#39;s at the toilet,&#34; she said with a sigh &#34;I hope he gets lost,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and look at Logan to see him putting his phone on silent and placing it in his back pocket. He looks at me and leans in to kiss me. I smile as he kisses me and move my hand to the back of his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;God get a room,&#34; Melanie said and I pull away and sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you get a room with that mood of yours?&#34; Logan snaps &#34;Moody bitch,&#34; he says. I smirk a little and try to hide it before Melanie sees it but she does and it causes her to get up and sit a space away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d hate to be her boyfriend,&#34; he said &#34;I&#39;d probably kill myself,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up,&#34; I said knocking his leg with mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just saying,&#34; he pauses &#34;she&#39;s too moody for her own good,&#34; he says, I roll my eyes at him and move my head onto his chest. Yasmin sits down next to me and looks at us. I sit up properly and she smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong with Melanie?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s right with her,&#34; Logan says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan stop it, Logan annoyed her so she&#39;s sitting over there,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh well Carl will probably annoy her too then,&#34; she says. I look to see Carl sat between Yasmin and Melanie. Cade sits next to her and Scott sits next to him with Julie next to Scott.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remind me to see how Brendan is when we get in,&#34; I said and look at Logan. He nods as he watches one of the commercials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mean to sound a bitch but she is doing my heading a little, all she&#39;s done is complain,&#34; she said and looks at me &#34;you don&#39;t even hear half of the things she complains about,&#34; she pauses &#34;not that you would want to,&#34; she said and I frown. &#34;I&#39;ll tell you another time,&#34; she adds and looks at Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan sighs loudly causing me to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She complains about us one of the servants told me this morning,&#34; he said &#34;I personally couldn&#39;t give two flying ducks about what she thinks about me,&#34; he said and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither do I,&#34; I said and kiss him on the lips. He pulls me closer to him by my waist, the cinema goes dark and I lean back close to him to kiss him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you two never get to do that in public but if I hear any kissing noises or any other sexual noises while I&#39;m watching this film I will kill you both,&#34; Yasmin says. I pull back from the kiss and look at her &#34;I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t kiss just be quiet about it ok,&#34; she states and smiles at us both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will,&#34; Logan said &#34;or we&#39;ll move away,&#34; he said and I laugh a little and look at him. He reaches for the popcorn and places it in between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\----</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logan moves his arms around me as we stand outside a place they call The Light waiting for Carl and Scott. He moves his hands onto my bum and kisses my cheek. I smile and look around realising we&#39;re hugging in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>public; we hardly go out back home just in case we get carried away with ourselves. The wrong kind of people could notice we&#39;re more than just friends or teacher and student and we just can&#39;t risk it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want to eat?&#34; he asks. &#34;There&#39;s Portuguese chicken or we can go for Japanese or Chinese or a buffet that&#39;s all different cuisine,&#34; he said and I smile at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You pick,&#34; I said and move my hands inside his jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you cold?&#34; he asks. I nod and he me pulls close to him and wraps his arms around my shoulders. &#34;Are you lot going home?&#34; he asks. &#34;You&#39;re not invited to eat with us,&#34; he said and I laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said it so nicely,&#34; I said quietly and watch Carl and Scott join us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carl ring Harrison to pick you all up or do more shopping we&#39;re going for something to eat,&#34; he said to Carl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not invited?&#34; he asks sadly and Logan shakes his head. &#34;I&#39;m facebook divorcing you,&#34; he said and huffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow don&#39;t do anything heartbreaking to him will you,&#34; Scott said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is a big thing though,&#34; I said &#34;facebook makes it official,&#34; I said and Carl laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t even know I was married,&#34; Logan said and I look up at him &#34;So where do you want to eat?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go for the save option and Chicken,&#34; I said and he smiles. &#34;Good you&#39;ll like this place it&#39;s nice,&#34; he said and takes my hand and starts to pull me back into the shopping centre called The Light. I look at the other &#34;I guess we&#39;re going, bye,&#34; I said giving them a quick wave and walking with Logan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Logan**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take Megan&#39;s hand in mine as we walk out of the restaurant. Her hands are thin and feminine very different to mine. She doesn&#39;t bite her nails but she doesn&#39;t grow them, she files them down every two weeks. Her hands always feel soft and delicate in my hands like if I squeeze her hand a little I feel I may break her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to go for a drink?&#34; I ask and she looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it would be best if we went back to the mansion,&#34; she said and moves closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess,&#34; I said and move my arm around her shoulders. &#34;Do you want to get a bus or a car back?&#34; I ask and she shivers. &#34;I think the car because you&#39;re cold,&#34; I said taking my jacket off and moving it over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember the first time I wore your jacket?&#34; she asks and I look at her and shake my head. She smiles and looks down while taking my hand in hers. &#34;I think you do really, it was the night I stayed at Julies and well we got a little more friendly that we should have at the time,&#34; she said and I frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to have to help me out as we&#39;ve got a little bit too friendly a lot of times,&#34; I said and she smiles to herself and looks down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The night Julie started looking through your wallet and I was on the phone to you,&#34; she said and it&#39;s like a bell goes off in my head and I smile and look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember now,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we get the bus because won&#39;t that take longer which would mean longer before you have to be in a meeting all night?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes it will so we can,&#34; I said &#34;we have quite a walk to the bus stop though,&#34; I said and she nods and smiles. &#34;I&#39;ll get you a coffee,&#34; I said and head towards a coffee shop. Megan follows me and stands next to me as we stand in line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I could eat more food I&#39;d eat that chocolate cake,&#34; she said with a smile while eying up a chocolate cake that had chocolate icing in the middle and on top and down the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I can fit more so I think I may get some of these little sweet things,&#34; I said and she looks at me and I move my arm around her shoulders. &#34;The bus ride is long you know,&#34; I inform her and she just shrugs and moves her arm around me and I feel her hand go into my back pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I help?&#34; I hear someone say. I look to see a skinny looking guy behind the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urm yeah I&#39;ll have tea and she&#39;ll have...&#34; I trail off and look at her &#34;a caramel hot chocolate,&#34; I said and look at her to see her smile and point to the cake. &#34;And a slice of the chocolate fudge cake to go,&#34; I said and felt Megan squeeze my bum. I look at her and she smiles and looks away from me. I smile to myself, this has got to be the most relaxed I&#39;ve felt in a long time. No worrying about people seeing us, no worry of being too abrupt, just pure relaxation and comfort with having her next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down at her I know that I&#39;ll be happy with her completely even more once we can go public. Being able to show everyone just how much I love and adore her will be the best feeling in the world. But right now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to be patient even though it may take a while as they said patience is a virtue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan,&#34; she said, catching my attention. I blink and look at her to see her looking at me expectedly with a cup in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this yours sir,&#34; one of the workers asks me. I look at him to see him holding a cup up to me &#34;Tea?&#34; he asks. I nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, long day,&#34; I said and took the cup. &#34;Thank you,&#34; I said and walked to the counter with condiments. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you take it for me?&#34; I ask Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;ve got the cake,&#34; she said, holding a paper bag up. I nod and put sugar in my tea. &#34;You can hold this, seen as though you got it,&#34; she said and I took the bag off her and picked up my tea. She takes my hand in hers and we walk out of the coffee shop. &#34;Will there be any shops open now?&#34; she asks. I frown and look at my watch to see it&#39;s half six.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can only think of two that will be open,&#34; I said and looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we take a look?&#34; she asks. I nod and turn to go up the hill of shops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want to see if there&#39;s a jacket I like,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you still cold?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No but you&#39;ll be cold soon and well I&#39;m not sharing,&#34; she said with a small smile and took a sip of her hot chocolate. I sigh and shake my head at her. She moves closer to me and moves her hand out of mine and around my waist and into my back pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We cross a road and walk down a wide street of shops. I look at her to see her looking around at each shop even though most of them are closed or just closing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you just see that?&#34; she said, catching my attention. I look where she&#39;s looking to see she&#39;s looking at a blonde girl who is looking back at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She just undressed you with her eyes,&#34; she said and I looked at her. &#34;I must be invisible,&#34; she said and I smiled a little and moved my arm around her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like the green eyed monster in you,&#34; I said and she looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not jealous, I&#39;m just shocked at the balls on some people, stupid tart,&#34; she said and took a sip of her hot chocolate. I laugh and pull her closer to me and kiss her on her head. We walk into House of Fraser (which is a department store) and she looks around. I move my hand off her and walk out of her grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Text me when you&#39;ve found something,&#34; I said to her and she nodded and walked off. I walk towards the jewellery section and look at watches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few minutes I feel someone watching me. I look around to see a short middle aged blonde woman in a green silk blouse and a black waist high skirt. She gives me a warm smile</p>
