                <p>Matteo&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately got out of the car and started fighting off the attacks of several people who were trying to attack me in a gang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started to show off my self-defense skills.  Luckily I always carry sharp weapons and firearms which I always keep or tuck under my clothes.  They pointed a gun at me.  I started to raise my hands when they instructed me to raise both hands.  I haven&#39;t taken out my weapon on purpose.  It seems like they are innocent and just kidding subordinates.  They didn&#39;t realize that I was carrying two types of weapons that I could attack one of them at any time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I was attacked and a big fight broke out.  I repel all attacks using weapons or not.  Until finally I was knocked out surrounded and held at gunpoint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Raise your hands!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to just go along with their flow.  Instantly my hand was skilled.  I took the knife that was under my jacket and quickly opened the lid then I threw it at one of them to trick the opponent.  After they were fooled, I immediately took out my gun and used it.  Until some of them started to get overwhelmed by my actions.  I can play it perfectly.  Until they lay helpless.  One of them even caught the knife that I was throwing earlier.  It turns out my throw was right on target.  Among them there were also people whose legs or arms were hit by ammunition from the gun I was aiming and my nails shot at the opposing party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, confess, whose orders were you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one wants to make a single sound.  Until I threatened them with force with my actions which made them feel scared and clearly in pain.  It&#39;s quite scary, my actions this time were a bit wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, tell me! Are you the Russian Don&#39;s men?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eeee... Yes, that&#39;s right, we are the Russian Don&#39;s men...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do you hand over your cell phones?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want to make sure that you guys are telling me the truth right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forcibly snatched the cell phone from one of them&#39;s pocket.  Now they can&#39;t fight me because they are weak and injured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately looked for Don&#39;s Russian contact.  Then copied it on my cell phone dashboard.  I put it in my contacts and sent it to Anthony and Louis.  After finishing I used my opponent&#39;s cell phone to call his boss.  I deliberately called through his subordinate&#39;s contacts so he could receive my call. If I used my contacts it would be detected by the cyber system he installed via an application on his cellphone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For this reason, I used his subordinate&#39;s cell phone so that he picked up my call and we could talk on the phone.  I can&#39;t wait to say something to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed like the Russian Don was waiting for this call from his men.  He wanted to immediately get good news from the results of his men&#39;s hard work attacking me.  But this time he was wrong, I was the one who killed his men one by one until they lay almost helpless and were no longer able to fight me even if I hacked their cell phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, how is it? What good news will I get now?&#34;  With full confidence he expected more from his subordinates.  Even though his subordinates were really very poor and they didn&#39;t even have anything.  I really rate their martial arts skills and their use of weapons at a rate of three tenths.  What an embarrassing number for a mafia.  Hmm... what kind of mafia are they?  A group that is incompetent in killing just one life.  Even though there were five of them while I was alone against their attacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed busy with thoughts that were starting to force him to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Russian Don, Vlad Petrov.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, who are you?&#34;  he asked panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you recognize my voice?&#34;  I&#39;m playing with him more and more on the phone.  This is a golden opportunity to terrorize him so that he feels uneasy and starts to get restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Genovese, try this, it&#39;s not my subordinate&#39;s voice. It looks like his cellphone has been hijacked by someone or perhaps our enemy. Because I don&#39;t recognize his voice.&#34;  Vlad heard a rumor from his colleague beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seems that around the Russian Don there is now Vlad.  The Russian don I mean is Vlad Petrov.  Don is a nickname or title for the leader of the biggest Mafia in Russia.  As for the Genovese Family, it also seems like they want to play games with me.  I think this is a matter of dividing areas of power that are used for business.  He has been in the BS alliance for quite a long time.  He seems to be part of the Russian Don&#39;s right hand man.  I really can&#39;t forgive this anymore.  I will immediately disband their alliance and completely turn everything back to zero.  In any case, I will not let them still join together in one large, strong group and become fierce capitalists in Russia.  In fact, their business has now spread and is collaborating with the Italian Mafia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now there is the added issue of Alessio joining their camp.  This will really threaten the Castello family business, especially my father, who will suffer huge losses this year and the following years if I continue to let this run rampant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is a matter of dividing power in business areas.  We, the Enzo Castello family, will experience a decline in expansion and our business area will experience a narrowing if this happens.  Our business colleagues will gradually become interested in joining the Russian Dons.  Meanwhile, the increasingly narrowing area will clog the pace of marketing targets and the target market will experience a significant decline.  This cannot be allowed to drag on.  If there is no accident, in the near future we will experience a lot of losses and could go bankrupt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started saying sentences that made him even more anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen to this! Blood must be paid for with blood!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately the phone was hung up quickly from there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed like the Russian Don was starting to feel threatened and didn&#39;t know what to answer so he just hung up the phone so he wouldn&#39;t hear any more horrible words coming out of my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After this I immediately threw the cell phone at the owner and then got into my car.  Lilianna opened it from the inside.  I started my car once I was inside.  Speeded up and left them just like that.  I saw that the expression on Lilianna&#39;s face looked a little scared to see me now.  It seemed like she witnessed a lot of things happening outside the car earlier.  I didn&#39;t have time to say anything after getting into the car and just focused on driving the car with full concentration.   Maybe another time I will explain it.</p>
