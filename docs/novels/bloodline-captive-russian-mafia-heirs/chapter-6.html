                <p>When there was no sound, I took a deep breath to reveal the truth that I had never shared with Matteo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s right, what you said at that time came true.&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;Yes, Callum is the result of my relationship with you at the bar three years ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we meet right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In my house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes of course, I want to meet my son right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, okay, later I will send you my complete address via text message so it&#39;s easier for you to track it and you don&#39;t have to remember it in your mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;ll wait, Matteo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Matteo sent a text message with his complete current address.  We ended the call and I rushed to his house by driving my own car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally I arrived at Matteo&#39;s house and was greeted warmly by several of his servants.  And Matteo came holding our son Callum.  I was very surprised and happy to see it.  Finally I was able to see my son again in good condition after being separated for a year.  Our instincts were inseparable and Callum immediately welcomed me with his arms.  I hugged him warmly until he fell asleep in my lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put him to sleep in his room, you accompany him there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my son to sleep and looked closely at him on his left side.  A feeling that is difficult for me to explain is that I feel happy to be with my son again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some time Matteo approached me and started to strike up a conversation with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna, did you immediately become pregnant with Callum?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, of course, I was two or three months late, I forgot. Obviously, it was from the time we had sex in the room at that time. I immediately used a test pack and the result was positive for pregnancy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it true?&#34;  He seemed unsure of my explanation and story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think that I made up stories and lied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, maybe you&#39;re in contact with someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! I only do it with you Matteo, really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I believe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, thank you if you trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait! Why did you break up with Callum? Since when?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One year ago, my father ordered someone to separate us. I don&#39;t know who the order was. Obviously at that time my father didn&#39;t like Callum being next to me. Especially when my father found out that I was pregnant with Callum. My father was really angry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I understand your father&#39;s feelings. I also wouldn&#39;t have thought that I would have contact with you that night. It all just happened and at that time I was feeling confused.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, me too, so why are you with Callum? Where did you find him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bought it from someone. I bought it from a woman named Beatrice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, that&#39;s my aunt, my father&#39;s sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s no wonder my aunt always acted strangely and I hid at my aunt&#39;s house since the moment I found out that I was pregnant with your child. I told her all about the dark incident and mentioned your name as the person who is the father of my Callum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, that&#39;s appropriate, it looks like Beatrice has planned all this, I mean, she was looking for me after getting information from you. It&#39;s true that your father told her to do something bad, but it looks like Beatrice wanted to bring Callum to me. It&#39;s just that she structured it in such a way so as not to be impressed by her plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s right, that could be what my aunt meant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, let&#39;s just forget about that problem. Obviously now Callum is with us, both of his biological parents. He will also be safe in the care of my cousin named Shopie. She is very painstaking in taking care of Callum even though he is still very young and doesn&#39;t have children yet. But his skills  Her ability to care for and take care of children can no longer be doubted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, thank God, I&#39;m happy to hear that. It seems like I&#39;ll leave Callum with you at home for the time being. Occasionally I&#39;ll come here to see him. Besides, he&#39;s more than two years old and he hasn&#39;t had breast milk since he was born, he&#39;s been doped by me.  Formula milk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, okay then, I will be happy to look after him with me here. Whenever you want to come here, the door to my house is always open for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant knocked on the door from outside the room that Matteo had deliberately closed earlier on my orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, there are Mr. Anthony and Mr. Louis,&#34;  he shouted from behind the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah wait a minute, I&#39;ll go out to meet him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay sir, I&#39;ll tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna, looks like I have to go out first to meet my partner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what business?&#34;  I started to be curious and care about Matteo&#39;s activities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m planning revenge on a mafia boss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh revenge? On the mafia boss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s right, I&#39;ll tell you more later. Now I have to meet my partner first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, be careful Matteo!&#34;  I don&#39;t know why I suddenly became very concerned about my son&#39;s father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind suddenly drifted away to what I had just heard from Matteo.  It turns out that Callum&#39;s father is someone who has ties to the mafia.  What exactly is Matteo Bogdan Castello&#39;s position?  Is he one of the children of a mafia boss whose last name is Castello too?  Yes, Enzo Castello, I remember that name was mentioned during the shooting tragedy of Jeremy Petrov.  Did Matteo have anything to do with Jeremy and my father&#39;s deaths?  I have to find out behind all this.</p>
