                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes, thank you, Lilianna.&#34;  Sillas immediately took that dress and secured it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long afterward Sillas came straight back to say something to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What else?&#34;  I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We got a message from our father to attend an event.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the event?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll find out later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Erm, does it have to be just the two of us? Why don&#39;t you just go alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way, he told us both, not just me, Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, yeah, that&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The event is tonight, don&#39;t go anywhere yet and get ready for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left and went to my room to rest.  Because it&#39;s been a long time since I occupied this room while I was staying at Matteo&#39;s house with Callum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see this room is a little outdated and poorly maintained.  I immediately opened the wardrobe to choose the clothes I would wear tonight to the event that Sillas was referring to.  Because Sillas won&#39;t rush him.  Because when I leave with Sillas, he is always in a hurry.  So I maximize my preparations from now on so that I don&#39;t miss anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until the evening you&#39;ve been waiting for arrives.  I immediately got ready to leave.  It turned out that Sillas was much more ready before I was.  He was waiting for me in front of the car.  I thought I would relax a bit after preparing everything since this afternoon.  But in fact Sillas was always more agile than me.  Unexpectedly, he was ready to leave and made me feel rushed as usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for us to get into the car.  Sillas drove the car directly without the help of my father&#39;s driver.  We turned out to be going to a very fancy police charity dinner.  I felt normal because I was used to attending events like this with my father and my brother.  We get respect here.  There are many dishes that we can choose to taste and eat.  Everything looks interesting and makes the taste buds intrigued.  Sillas and I were invited to sit at the tables and chairs that had been provided for invited guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, those who have just arrived can immediately occupy the chairs and tables that have been provided. Especially for Mr. Alessio&#39;s envoys, you can occupy the table over there, please!&#34;  While showing us to immediately occupy it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It turned out to be a different table from the others.  It is more luxurious and elegant.  It seems my father has an important role in this event.  So Sillas and I felt flattered by their welcome.  They were very enthusiastic about welcoming us with great friendliness and politeness.  Sillas and I immediately sat on the chairs and table that had been specially prepared for us.  Until I felt something strange behind this table.  It was like something was moving under the table touching my shoes and feet.  I feel uncomfortable and amused.  Is there a cat downstairs?  I felt more anxious when someone pulled my dress from under the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna...&#34; A soft whisper came from under the table.  I know his voice clearly.  But Sillas didn&#39;t seem to hear him because he was more focused on someone who was speaking at the front giving a speech on the podium.  It seems like the organizer of this event is currently standing there.  But I&#39;m still focused on this touch that sneaks under the table.  Behind the table I&#39;m at, there seems to be someone who recognizes me.  Because I heard the rumor calling my name clearly.  I immediately slightly opened the table cloth which was flowing down to the surface of the floor.   But that didn&#39;t happen because Sillas suddenly said something to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sillas returned to focusing on the future again.  It seemed like he didn&#39;t really intend to chat, just give a response to the speaker in front.  I immediately looked forward to it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But once again the voice called while pulling my dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped in surprise and looked down slightly revealing the table cloth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sttt!&#34;  He covered his mouth with his index finger and told me to keep quiet so he wouldn&#39;t be caught.  It seemed like he was hiding and worried about being caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately understood Matteo&#39;s signal.  But why is Matteo suddenly at this event after being missing for so long for the last few days?  It looks like he is being held captive here, I mean someone is holding him captive here.  That means the perpetrator is the person who is currently hanging around here and who is the mastermind behind Matteo&#39;s arrest, meaning the Russian Don.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the official event was postponed and would continue to the next session, a coffee break was opened first.   It turns out that many of the officers who were present here knew me and especially Sillas.  They even recognized Sillas as someone who came and donated to their event.  It turns out that our father Alessio is often a donor and contributes to school funds.  There were several people approaching the foot table while they were having a coffee break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them explained that Sillas was known as a good guy to the men in blue.  It has even helped prevent bad things from happening to them in the past.  We don&#39;t know his true identity.  I don&#39;t really care about that.  Let Sillas talk to them.  Meanwhile I focused on Matteo who was still under the table.  Sillas was so great and sophisticated that at once they easily accepted him.  Until they took Sillas to another place to taste the banquet that was available.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, I immediately told Matteo to get out from under the table and took him straight to the toilet.  Luckily, this toilet is a public toilet, not a toilet designated for each gender.  In the toilet we immediately locked the door from the inside.  Luckily there are several doors and spaces.  So if someone wants to go to the toilet, they don&#39;t have to queue here.  There are other toilets to use so we won&#39;t feel disturbed in here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where have you been all this time? You&#39;ve been missing for days and suddenly you&#39;re here.&#34;  I was worried about Matteo&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a long story, I&#39;ll explain later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly Matteo brought his face closer to me and started kissing me with a passion that made me rise too.  There was a semi-hot scene that made Matteo and I feel like we were starting to burn.  Touch after touch of excitement began to occur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo does it absolutely stunningly.  He removed my mini dress very aggressively.  I started to feel the touch of his mouth on my neck creeping and tickling more and more.  I felt mesmerized by his touch this time.  This is beyond my plans and expectations. Everything just happened without me being able to predict.</p>
