                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s finally here. Yeee... Callum is a great kid.&#34;  I appreciated his persistence by giving my son a round of applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled and joined in clapping happily and very excitedly.  I feel happy to see him smiling and happy like this.  After one year, I was separated from the baby I gave birth to from my own womb.  I lowered my body and bent over and looked at Callum closely when we were facing each other.  Then I hugged Callum tightly.  But he rejected it and rebelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh, what&#39;s wrong with Mom, it&#39;s hot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let go of my hug and teased Callum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is your child like that?&#34;  While pinching his cheeks, he was very excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy...&#34;  He rebelled against wanting me to be spoiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, let&#39;s go to our room!&#34;  I got up from my current position and demanded Callum again then walked towards his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re here.&#34;  I opened the door to his room slowly and we entered Callum&#39;s room as usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing strange in Callum&#39;s room, it was still as usual.  He asked me to get his robots and some toys on the table.  Because he felt he couldn&#39;t reach it because it was still too short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That mother.&#34;  While pointing at the guns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This?&#34;  I held it and asked him to make sure this was what he wanted me to get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s a gun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took it and gave it to Callum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This.&#34;  Then rubbed his head gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Callum wants to be a sniper, right? Want to be good at shooting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mom.&#34;  Smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bang bang bang... Mom, watch it, raise your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, please.&#34;  I complied with his request to raise my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pretended to fall and the story died because Callum shot me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly I woke up again and startled him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aaaaaa Mom, I am shocked.&#34;  While holding his chest with his right hand..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahahahaa...&#34; I laughed and felt annoyed with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it! That&#39;s it! I begs forgiveness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hit me even worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until finally he might have felt it and slowly his eyes began to dim.  Finally Callum fell asleep in my lap.  I held him for a long time and now I will move him to the bed so he can sleep comfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;ve reached bed.  I put him to sleep and I stayed with Callum beside him.  Lie down and look at his face, which really resembles Matteo.  I didn&#39;t even think that I would get a child from Matteo, someone I didn&#39;t know at all.  In fact, he is very strange in my life.  I didn&#39;t expect that my decision to step foot into the bar would produce results like this.  I have children even though I have never been married at all.  But this is the path of life and fate that I have chosen to become my destiny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly I heard gunshots that didn&#39;t seem far from here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang bang bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped in surprise and immediately changed my position from lying down to sitting.  My eyes widened and I started to feel threatened.  My mind began to become uneasy and I suddenly turned my attention to my son Callum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of gunfire was getting closer.  I think the sound was downstairs, I mean on the first floor.  Could it be... my eyes automatically widened.  It seemed like there was chaos downstairs.  I immediately jumped from my sitting position to standing and got out of bed and walked towards the bedroom window in a hurry.  I focused my attention on the front page below.  It was seen at the gate that a fistfight was taking place between several people and the house guard guarding the gate of this house.  I started to feel panicked and lost.  Confused about what to do now.  Moreover, it&#39;s just the two of us in this room.  Downstairs there were several servants and gardeners.  But I don&#39;t know what to do or where to go now.  I saw now that the house guard had collapsed because he had been shot.  Maybe he died... I was immediately anxious and uncertain.  Pacing back and forth with my anxiety starting to emerge.  Hoping that a savior will come to fix this situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was immediately reminded of Callum&#39;s safety.  Suddenly, a crazy idea arises to hide Callum in the cupboard so that no one knows where he is.  Because maybe the criminal will come here and go up to the second floor and then enter this room.  I started to feel nervous and then hugged Callum&#39;s body tightly, hugged him and held him on my lap who was still fast asleep.  I immediately opened the cupboard and put Callum in the cupboard.  I didn&#39;t even think long about it because something bad could happen to Callum in this cupboard.  But I&#39;m more afraid if Callum is hit by gunfire from criminals I don&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After putting Callum in the cupboard, I immediately locked the cupboard tightly from the outside.  Suddenly the sound of gunfire got closer after me with the sound of the door breaking which sounded very loud and strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang bang bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo, come out! We know you are in this house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the sound of someone screaming who seemed to be downstairs and had come inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woe!&#34;  I whispered softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was immediately curious to see it from above.  I immediately ran and locked the door to this room from the outside.  Then peek from above.  Sure enough, the gang of criminals had entered the house and ransacked the contents of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But suddenly Matteo comes from outside and beats them one by one until an extraordinary, astonishing and thrilling fight scene occurs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt anxious and restless because Matteo was beaten by several people.  But in the end Matteo got the win and they fell.  Some died on the spot and some went out to escape.  I started to feel like my heart was falling suddenly, like it was falling, feeling relieved after pounding so hard for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately went downstairs to the first floor to meet Matteo.  Several servants and gardeners who had been hiding also approached Matteo.  Everyone helped clean up the mess.  Meanwhile, the guard of this house was fatally shot.  I immediately remembered Callum, who I kept in the cupboard.  I immediately jumped upstairs to make sure Callum wasn&#39;t lacking oxygen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slapped my forehead when Matteo reminded me about Callum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Callum?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wretched!&#34;  Patting your own forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo wore a confused expression.   Moreover, without answering Matteo&#39;s question, I immediately ran to the room on the second floor.  Running hastily and full of hope that Callum will be okay.  It turns out Callum is still alive and in good condition.  I held him in my arms.  Feeling guilty about what I did to him so naively earlier.</p>
