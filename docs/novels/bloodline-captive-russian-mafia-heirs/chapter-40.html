                <p>Matteo&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She learned everything here that the partnership meeting she had with her late father&#39;s mafia group would be postponed to the next meeting that had been scheduled earlier.    I just guided her in the right direction when she asked.  Lilianna let me explain all the ins and outs without feeling teachery.  In fact, she was happy when I tried to get inside her to explain what she wanted to know a lot about the mafia world according to the file she showed me.  It turned out that Lilianna was really innocent.  She wasn&#39;t even afraid to open this file in front of me, who wasn&#39;t actually part of her group.  She trusts me too easily.  This is precisely what makes me feel sorry for her.  Don&#39;t have the heart to let her be surrounded by bad people who could harm her.  She&#39;s too good for a mobster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I explained a lot of things she asked me.  Finally, Lilianna dared to make a decision and she told me and then asked me for advice again.  Whether the decision is right or not, she still needs a little convincing.  So I assured her that the decision she had taken was quite right and could be realized.  She was happy and amazed by my praise and support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, I became very interested in her when Lilianna had made her decision and was thinking about what she would do after the last meeting.  I think she is quite intelligent in thinking, but she is too kind and innocent.  I felt fascinated when she firmly stated her decision in front of me.  I don&#39;t know because maybe basically I&#39;m falling in love with her.  So everything feels better.  But it&#39;s true that Lilianna has talent in the mafia world, she just needs to hone and direct it.  With various experiences in the future, she will be able to become a person who can lead her group, I think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After talking and discussing things she didn&#39;t know much about the mafia world.  She immediately said goodbye to me and rushed to visit the residence of her subordinate who had just died.  She wants to be seen as a leader who is quick to respond and can respect her subordinates even though behind the scenes she already knows their true rottenness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay Matteo, it looks like I have to go now to immediately visit the funeral procession of my subordinate who... oh never mind. The point is I have to pretend to appreciate it by attending the funeral.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you have to show a personal side that looks like nothing happened between you.  You have to learn to be beautiful and adopt chameleon knowledge which is very useful in this mafia world!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes of course Matteo, thank you for the advice and knowledge and attention you have showered on me. I really didn&#39;t think something like this could happen. I hope now nothing will happen out there when I&#39;m about to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope so too, Lilianna. May safety always accompany you wherever you are. Don&#39;t be afraid or worried. I will back you up, Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you very much Matteo, I&#39;ll go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilianna immediately left and left me alone back in my study.  I smiled after she left.  I feel like she has made my life as if it only contains her.  It seems like I really fell in love and started to love Lilianna.  This is proven by my attitude which I feel has changed drastically like this.  Becomes very melancholy and is ready to commit herself to Lilianna at any time.  I feel that falling in love has made me a superhero who always wants to be at the forefront of the subject he loves.  I was even happy when Lilianna asked me a lot of questions about things she didn&#39;t know about the mafia world.  I feel used by her and can be relied on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a moment Lilianna left here just now.  I&#39;m going crazy and can only smile to myself thinking about it.  She looked so typical when she started joining a big mafia group.  Her aura grew and made me even more fascinated by her.  Lilianna truly exuded an extraordinary aura.  So I feel that loving her is not wrong this time.  Even though I am still bound by a relationship with Massima Adelina, a woman from Italy.  Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted when Shopie knocked on the door to take Callum to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knock knock knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shopie knocked on the door as she loudly called my name from behind the door of my study.  Outside she seemed to be with Callum because her voice could be heard all the way to my table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo... Can I come in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Sophie, come in!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie came in and brought Callum in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo, I&#39;m going to take Callum to my house for a moment. Would you allow that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, okay. Let me take you, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In that case, okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately rushed to start the car after walking and arrived at the garage.  Together with Shopie and Callum in the car we immediately drove towards Sophie&#39;s house.  Until we arrived in front of Sophie&#39;s house.  I didn&#39;t go down with the two of them.  Just waiting in the car in front of his house to make sure everything was safe after the two of them entered Shopie&#39;s house for a while.  It turned out to be safe and there were no signs that anything bad had happened or would happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you coming down first, Matteo?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Shopie, I still have work to do. I&#39;ll just leave Callum to you. For anything related to Callum, you can call me at any time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well that&#39;s for sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, come in now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw Shopie walking on Callum&#39;s lap and entering her house.  After that I had time to stay here and think a little.  Then I immediately thought back to Lilianna.  I immediately thought I would follow her to where she had gone.  To ensure that she would be safe there.  Worried that something unexpected will happen.  So I have to always monitor it so I don&#39;t miss it.  She is in a vulnerable area and still needs assistance.  Because it is possible that evil hands will injure her or even kill her without any conscious calculation.  So I will continue to look after it even from behind the scenes.  I drove my car to the public cemetery which was suspected to be the burial place of mafia members who were members of the late Alessio&#39;s group.  They are always buried there if any of them dies.  So I immediately went there right now.  Drove at a fast speed and in a hurry.  Before I feel sorry for missing a lot of important information about Lilianna.  I don&#39;t want Lilianna to be in trouble when I&#39;m not around to monitor the situation in the area where she is standing.  Until the speed of driving took me to my final destination.  I started to check the situation outside first in the car to monitor it.</p>
