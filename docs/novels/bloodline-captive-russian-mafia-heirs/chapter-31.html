                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There have been a lot of unexpected events in my life lately.  Especially regarding the safety issue of my son Callum.  So I realized that I had to be willing to take charge and play a role in everything for our good.  Moreover, currently I haven&#39;t found Matteo back safely.  It seems like something bad has happened to Matteo.  It was true that I suspected that Matteo was in great danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knock knock knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Lilianna? Miss? Are you in there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Mr. Matteo&#39;s servant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice is unique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll accompany Callum to sleep in a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up from my position and started walking towards the door of this room to open it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, please call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of whom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, don&#39;t know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, the person didn&#39;t mention his name, he just said to convey to the people closest to Mr. Matteo that there was an important call and he had to answer it immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apart from that, did he have anything to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;  While shaking her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is the phone still connected?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, of course, it&#39;s not closed yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;ll be right down to answer the phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant left first after finishing delivering the message.  The rest, I first checked Callum&#39;s condition to make sure he was still asleep and safe.  Once I felt safe I immediately went out of the room and closed the door from the outside.  Then I walked downstairs to immediately pick up the phone before it was automatically disconnected or disconnected from there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arrived downstairs and immediately picked up the phone.  Feeling uneasy and worried that something bad will happen.  Moreover, I haven&#39;t seen Matteo come home.  Feeling excited by the news I will receive.  I immediately had a bad feeling regarding the information I would get from this call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, straight away, we are asking for a ransom for Matteo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does that mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are waiting at...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly the phone was disconnected for some reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Makes me even more anxious and uncertain.  Feeling confused about what to do.  Moreover, they call via landline, not cell phone.  They also haven&#39;t had time to say where they are with Matteo.  Unfortunately, it looks like Matteo has been taken hostage and is in danger.  I had to act immediately and do something to save Matteo immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I realized that they definitely had enough power to end Matteo.  Inner consciousness says that I have to stay here in this house and not leave the house.  I don&#39;t have to deal with bastards and just pray for people like the Russian mafia to find a bright spot that doesn&#39;t cause casualties.  Especially Matteo, I definitely don&#39;t want anything wrong with Matteo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A week passed without news from Matteo.  I still don&#39;t have any movement to find the father of my child.  Because I don&#39;t have the capacity to take actions that could endanger my life, my child&#39;s life and Matteo could be even more threatened.  I hope and believe that Matteo has his own way of dealing with them.  I think that Matteo is a smart man and has lots of ideas to be able to repel them so he can be free and escape from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After several days of accompanying Callum at Matteo&#39;s house, I received news from Sillas that he needed thorough preparations for his wedding which was not long from now.  I also got a telephone call from Sillas and he openly asked me to do something related to his wedding preparations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately took my cell phone and looked at the monitor screen.  It turned out to be Sillas, without thinking twice I immediately picked up the phone from my sister.  Who knows, he might tell you something important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna, where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go home and help me prepare a few things regarding my upcoming wedding. Time is running out, I&#39;m asking you to help me get a dress from the boutique.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What dress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Obviously a wedding dress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? Why doesn&#39;t Aelita just bring it or she can order anyone to do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm, don&#39;t do too much of this and that, do it immediately, please do it as soon as possible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without further ado and straight to the point Sillas ordered me and suddenly turned off the phone when he had finished conveying his message to me.  Even I didn&#39;t have a chance to refuse it.  Looks like I have to do it.  Before I met Sillas in a state of great anger at me.  Just bringing a dress that has been ordered at the boutique is not a heavy thing.  Of course I can do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I thought of Callum and without hesitation called Shopie to take my place in looking after Callum.  When I wanted to get the dress, I hoped that Shopie had already arrived here.  Because I didn&#39;t dare leave Callum with Matteo&#39;s other servants.  I will feel uneasy if Sophie isn&#39;t there to accompany Callum later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Lilianna, what&#39;s wrong?&#34;  Shopie picked up my phone and immediately asked what I meant by suddenly calling her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you come to Matteo&#39;s house soon, Shopie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, of course, you&#39;re free and don&#39;t mind, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I was planning to go to Matteo&#39;s house now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;ve been waiting for your arrival here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited for Shopie while playing together with Callum who had just woken up.  Finally Shopie came and I immediately gave her a task while I left Callum for the next few moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, you came too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sorry for waiting a bit long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah no, just relax. Oh yes, Shopie, I will be away for a while because of family matters. I hope you are willing to wait for Callum here and look after him. How are you willing to do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, no problem, go! I&#39;ll look after Callum and play with him. Leave it all to me. Besides, I really miss him because he was on holiday in Italy for too long, hehe...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah, I almost forgot. You can bring the Italian souvenirs I keep in Callum&#39;s room. Take one and choose whichever you like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahaha. Thank you,  Lilianna.&#34;  She looked happy because she would get souvenirs from abroad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, I immediately said goodbye to immediately fulfill Sillas&#39; request.  Without waiting long, I went straight to the boutique and took the order for the dress that Aelita would wear at her wedding with Sillas.  Don&#39;t stay long in the boutique, after arriving and taking the order that has been prepared by the boutique owner directly.  I didn&#39;t wait long and went straight to my house to hand over this order to Sillas.  So that Sillas wouldn&#39;t feel like I had ignored his orders.  Finally I arrived home and brought the luxurious dress I had brought from the boutique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This.&#34;  While handing over the dress I brought to Sillas.</p>
