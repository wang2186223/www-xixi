                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I actually feel uncomfortable being in this mafia world.  Especially when I got a lot of rejection while in the field.  For this reason, I will cancel my choice of taking over my father&#39;s business.  But I will just stay longer in this mafia group than I need just to get revenge.  So I really need help from my late father&#39;s position as a privilege to be respected and followed by even a few people in the group.  The rest may be in the spotlight for other groups.  I took revenge for the deaths of my father, Sillas, and Jeremy in the past.  Because my wounds have not healed from the incident where I lost the people closest to me.  If I don&#39;t take revenge then I will continue to be busy with prolonged fear and terror.  Especially regarding the safety of those closest to me now.  More importantly, it is about the safety of my son Callum, and his father, Matteo.  I have no one left but those who are faithful on this earth.  Especially after it was followed by the departure of my father and brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo, what should I do to immediately carry out my revenge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, by directly targeting their mafia boss. Who else but the Russian Don? We have to start being firm in killing the kingpin. Here, his subordinates will follow his head. If their head is tripped, then life is over. So the main thing now is to track down Don&#39;s whereabouts in Russia. To be able to execute it shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you&#39;re right, Matteo. There&#39;s no point in taking too long to let him breathe a sigh of relief. It will only damage our future business structure. Not to mention that he will become increasingly capitalistic and reluctant to share opportunities with others. He is quite greedy and often uses any means necessary.  We need to quickly eradicate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, are you ready now to do it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;ll start now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt helped by having Matteo beside me.  Even though he was impressed he was giving me a piggyback ride.  Sometimes I feel and think, is it possible that Matteo is using me for his purposes?  But is Matteo that evil to be able to carry out his mission?  I don&#39;t think so, Matteo can&#39;t take advantage of this situation by making me look like his puppet.  I believe that Matteo this time has a sincere heart towards me and wants to help me as much as possible to solve everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo and I worked together to stay afloat.  We couldn&#39;t wait any longer and let the Don Russians attack again and take the lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So we have to immediately track their current movements and play smart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo and I immediately met the technician to move quickly.  Meanwhile, Matteo&#39;s friend is assigned to find the whereabouts of the Russian mafia boss.  We divide each task so that matters can be completed quickly and realized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then, what should we do now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We divide the tasks,&#34;  Matteo said while dividing the tasks that would be carried out by each of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and I are meeting with technicians, while Louis and Anthony are monitoring the Russian mafia boss to ensure his movements. I hope that our communication will run smoothly and we will continue to communicate with each other to exchange information that can support the smooth running of our mission!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready Matteo, come on, Anthony, let&#39;s start doing our job!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on! Let&#39;s go first, Matteo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, be careful, take care of yourselves!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anthony and Louis showed their thumbs up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it&#39;s just me and Matteo here.  Without waiting long, we went straight to the technology shop to meet the technician there.  Making sure that what we need is there.  As support in carrying out our mission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I admit that when I found Matteo in my life, it felt like he had given me experience in terms of following people and being a spy.  Matteo has awakened my intelligent soul.  So that I am quicker and more agile in thinking and more agile in acting and making decisions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After we managed to find a technician at the technology shop and carried out what we expected, of course, we went straight back to Matteo&#39;s house.  Feeling like the burden on your shoulders is starting to get heavy.  I gave a code and signaled that I needed to take a break with my child.  Matteo immediately understood my inner needs.  He immediately invited Callum and me to dinner at a very luxurious restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We started chatting with our son Callum.  Giving time to get to know each other in family bonds.  Matteo and I talked to each other about the future and continuation of Callum&#39;s life.  Looking at this child with great hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started to look at Matteo very deeply.  Seeing the future in the twinkle of his eyes.  Immediately remembered about that serene night.  We had feelings for each other without realizing it.  I felt like I had forgotten something and I tried to remember something I had forgotten.  I started to remember what I liked about that guy.  Of course, his presence and kindness dominate.  Suddenly our dinner activities were interrupted by the sound of Matteo&#39;s cell phone ringing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, it looks like there&#39;s been a call, probably a report from Anthony and Louis. Try picking up Matteo, don&#39;t delay it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, alright.&#34;  He began to hastily take his cell phone from his pocket and ensure that the incoming call was very important for him and for the continuity of our joint mission in eradicating the Russian Don mafia gang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw him pick up the phone with a serious expression.  He started changing the setting to a loudspeaker so I could hear him.  But he lowered the volume of his cell phone a little.  Because now we are in a public place.  So he was very careful because he was worried that someone would be stalking our movements here.  Never know that the enemy could be anywhere when they really want to get important information regarding their opponent.  For this reason, we really need to be alert wherever we are.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After picking up the phone, I immediately asked.  I asked to make sure what I heard just now was true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo, did I hear you correctly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not, Lilianna, you were right in hearing, indeed we received news that there were many people from our group who were being held in the weapons warehouse and they needed our help immediately. One of them is my second in command, you must know that too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, is he Louis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right, it was Anthony who called me just now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what are you going to do now Matteo?&#34;</p>
