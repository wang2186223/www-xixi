                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived at the Russian airport, Matteo immediately took me to his house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To get some rest and especially now that Callum is still asleep.  There&#39;s no way I can just go home when Callum is still sleeping soundly like this.  He would cry badly when he woke up from his sleep and found that I was not beside him.  For this reason, I was very forced to follow Matteo&#39;s steps towards his house.  Until we arrived at Matteo&#39;s house.  I immediately took Callum to his room to put him to bed to make him more comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get some rest, this afternoon I&#39;ll take you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, where?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Later you will find out for yourself, now get enough rest because after a long journey I think you need to get lots of rest to keep your body fit and accompany Callum here until he wakes up. Because poor Callum, he needs to be accompanied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, okay then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, have a good rest. I&#39;m in my study. If you need anything, just give me a call! I&#39;ll respond quickly if you need anything, especially Callum. Watch out, I&#39;ll leave you, stay here before I come back. Because I&#39;m worried that something bad will happen if you and  Callum is outside the room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Matteo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo walked towards the exit and left me and Callum alone in this room.  After a few moments I immediately fell asleep with Callum while hugging his tiny body.  Until finally Callum woke up from his sleep.  I also woke up and was shocked from my position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It turns out Callum is awake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, where&#39;s Dad?&#34;  While rubbing his eyes he asked where his father was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your father is at home, he is in his study. Does Callum want me to call Dad here to Callum&#39;s room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;  While nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately called Matteo to come here immediately to meet his son.  Because Callum started asking where his father was.  If Matteo doesn&#39;t come here quickly, he&#39;s worried that Callum will be disappointed and start showing a gloomy face.  But fortunately Matteo immediately responded quickly.  As promised, he immediately came to this room to answer my call.  Matteo opened the door from the outside and entered this room with a smile at his son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad.&#34;  Callum immediately got up and then ran towards Matteo  and Matteo greeted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy&#39;s brilliant son has just woken up, hasn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo got up on Callum&#39;s lap and walked towards me to say something he seemed to have planned to tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes, Lilianna, you and Callum are coming with me now. I have something to do outside. Because if I leave you two at home like that, I&#39;m afraid something bad will happen like what happened before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, but where are you taking us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To the tech store.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s see later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fine if you don&#39;t want to tell me your intentions and goals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, get ready and fix Callum, wash his face first and change clothes! I&#39;m waiting downstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Matteo, I&#39;ll do it right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know why I became so obedient to Matteo even though I wasn&#39;t his wife or girlfriend.  But I chose to follow all his orders for one big reason, namely for the good and safety of my son Callum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Callum&#39;s here!&#34;  I told Callum to come closer to me because I would fix him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Callum and mother first, we&#39;re going to go out, but Callum washes his face and changes clothes first because he&#39;s been traveling a long way. There&#39;s a lot of dust on Callum&#39;s face, body and clothes. So that it&#39;s clean, Callum has to be fixed by mother first. Meanwhile, father is waiting for Callum.  If Callum and mother are finished, you can go straight downstairs to meet father and we&#39;ll go out later, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum obeyed his father&#39;s words and immediately came over to me.  He seemed excited because he probably thought his father would take him for a walk.  But I don&#39;t think Matteo will take us on a trip or tour.  In fact, I think Matteo has something to do with his duties in his mafia group.  But why do you have to take me and Callum.  Although I realized that Matteo might feel anxious if he had to leave the two of us at home like yesterday.  So he preferred to take us out and with him it would be safer even though he was looking for faults with his opponent.  But I can only follow the plot and play according to his way of thinking which I cannot guess and cannot predict at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have finished fixing Callum and I have cleaned up myself and am now ready to be taken out by Matteo.  I immediately invited Callum to go downstairs to meet Matteo.  He was waiting for us downstairs and stood staring at his cellphone screen.  His gaze was securely serious and I was reluctant to disturb or interrupt his gaze.  I&#39;m reluctant to disturb his focus.  Even when Callum and I were standing nearby, he didn&#39;t feel at all aware of our presence here.  Even though we stood here for a long time waiting for him to finish with his business on his cellphone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally he was finished with his business on his cell phone and began to notice the presence of me and Callum beside him.  We had been standing for a while and he just realized this.  That means the business he is currently involved in is quite important to him.  To the point that he just ignored our existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eh, it turns out you guys are already here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve been here a long time ago. It&#39;s been a long time waiting for you to finish with your cell phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, I&#39;m sorry, Lilianna! Forgive me, Callum!&#34;  As he lowered his head to align his face with Callum&#39;s and then held Callum&#39;s cheeks with both hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you guys ready?&#34;  Matteo rose to his feet again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready&#34; Callum answered very enthusiastically and very happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Made Matteo and I silent for a moment.  But pretend nothing will happen.  It seemed like it was true that Callum thought his father would take him on a trip to a beautiful place.  But unfortunately his guess was wrong.  Hmm... Very poor Callum, but I hope Matteo will make it up to him after this.  After he finished with matters surrounding his mafia world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let!&#34;  Matteo immediately put Callum on his lap so he could walk faster rather than having to wait for him to walk alone which would slow things down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We arrived at the car and Matteo immediately drove the car to where he was going now.  The journey was very fast and Matteo drove a bit hastily.  I didn&#39;t want to ask too many questions other than being quiet and just caring about Callum engaging him in conversation and giving Callum some of the snacks available in the car.</p>
