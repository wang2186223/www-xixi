                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until finally Callum fell asleep again.  Hmm... it looks like he&#39;s quite tired after the long journey.  He had spent a lot of time traveling around Italy.  Including he circled the shopping center there for the last time to set foot in Italy.  So it&#39;s not surprising that Callum feels very tired.  It&#39;s better for him to sleep than to be sick.  I don&#39;t want or have the power to disturb him.  So letting him sleep was my choice.  Moreover, Matteo will launch his action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want Callum to witness it with his own eyes.  He was too small to witness the fight between the mafia that could occur next.  Because I really think it will happen.  I didn&#39;t want to let Callum see something he didn&#39;t have time to see.  Because children&#39;s memory is very fragile and long.  Worried that it will have a bad impact on his personality and future.  So now that he is asleep, I hope he sleeps soundly and long so that he doesn&#39;t see his father dealing with the mafia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally we arrived at the technology store.  Suddenly I was surprised to see the Russian Don in front of the technology shop.  So I spontaneously asked Matteo about my vision.  Just to make sure that I see Vlad Petrov is here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the Russian Don huh? Am I seeing that right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, that&#39;s Vlad Petrov.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is he doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo just smiled faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw outside that there were many people visiting the shop who wanted to make transactions here.  The streets were crowded with people going back and forth about their own business.  So is it possible that Matteo will cause chaos in a place as busy as this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now what are you going to do Matteo to the Russian Don?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will attack him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, are you kidding Matteo? This is a public place, how busy are you going to make a mess? You&#39;re going to do a lot of harm to this technology shop in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you&#39;re right. So what do you think I should do now? Give me an alternative solution that I can adopt now!&#34;  Matteo asked me, he asked me for advice on an alternative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you can just spy on him to get further information regarding what he is going to do. Don&#39;t attack him now. If you do it now then it will only be in vain. Moreover, there will be many people who will feel traumatized by the chaos that will happen later.  I&#39;m just suggesting that you&#39;d better follow the Russian Don&#39;s movements before his execution. Don&#39;t be too hasty in taking a stand.  So you won&#39;t feel regret later.  If you fail to attack the Russian Don this time then you will be very threatened later.  He would know who had attacked him openly.  This will only make you overwhelmed later.  Because of course the Russian Don will not remain silent and will mobilize all his men to continue hunting you.  In fact, the worst thing is that he will also hunt Callum and me because we are here and they will definitely see and pay attention and remember what they see later.  Maybe you can understand what I&#39;m saying here.  Then the decision is up to you, Matteo.  I hope you will take a wise attitude.  Because this is not just about you, but there are me and Callum too, especially Callum.  Don&#39;t you want Callum to stay safe and sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I want Callum to stay awake and safe with us, Lilianna. In fact, since I have two blood, I have become more careful in my actions. Because I&#39;m really worried that something bad will happen to Callum. Only Callum is in my brain now. I don&#39;t want my little angel  This is okay. Of course I can adopt your idea and I will accept it as good advice. I really appreciate your suggestion and what&#39;s more, your suggestion is quite a solution to my problem  I&#39;ll attack myself now. He will continue to target me if I fail to attack him now. Therefore, following him is a reasonable reason and I can accept it now without much further consideration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Matteo of course, I hope we are always safe and awake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I hope so too, Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got tripped up because of our conversation, in the end we almost lost track of the Russian Don.  But suddenly I looked back and found it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, wait, where is the Russian Don now? Unfortunately, because we talked for too long, we lost track of him.&#34;  While tapping his forehead gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh, is that him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes you&#39;re right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s follow him.&#34;  Matteo excitedly chased him by driving the car in a hurry because he didn&#39;t want to waste too much time before he lost track of the Russian Don again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo, be careful, don&#39;t be too reckless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed like the Russian Don already knew that his car was being followed by Matteo&#39;s car.  Although most likely he doesn&#39;t know that Kamji is in this car.  I don&#39;t think he knew that Matteo had been following him all this time.  But he only realized that now he was being followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked in the rearview mirror and saw that there was a car following the car we were riding in too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo&#39;s in trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;  While focused on driving, pay attention to the movement of the Russian Don car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look in the rearview!&#34;  For a moment, Matteo focused his eyes by glancing at the rearview mirror of his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, what a shame, it seems like they&#39;ve been following us for a while now. Who do you think they are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car behind our car was traveling at high speed.  Meanwhile the Russian Don car also started moving at high speed too.  We were chasing each other on the street.  Almost forgot that this was a public road.  We just drive the car.  But we just followed the direction of the Russian Don car wherever it went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately advised Matteo to stop everything.  Before he was really caught red-handed and looked at the gauge on the car, the fuel was almost out.  I wouldn&#39;t be able to imagine if this car stopped running by itself because it ran out of gas.  Then the lives of Callum and both of us will be at stake.  However, Matteo finally complied with my request and after realizing that his petrol was almost out of fuel he immediately turned around and drove very fast away from them.  I think the Russian Don and the car driver who was trying to follow us were surprised and shocked by Matteo&#39;s sudden action.  Until finally we were safe and avoided them.  Now we walked at a normal normal speed and drove towards Matteo&#39;s house.  Finally we arrived home.</p>
