                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was immediately shocked and ran back and hid after hearing my lover Jeremy&#39;s cry.   So at that moment it was the right thing because all eyes looked towards the source of the sound, namely Jeremy.  Finally I was able to hide after almost being shot several times.  But damn!  Unlucky!  Jeremy is the one who becomes the victim.  They confidently shot Jeremy without hesitation.  Jeremy was even shot several times, leaving him lying weak and helpless.  Since then I have witnessed cruel things happening when they skin Jeremy in public.  Blood was all over there and only sadness remained when everything had dispersed. I buried the remaining blood in my face on the terrace while screaming hysterically, no one heard because I came out in a very quiet situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since that day, since that tragic incident, it has become even more traumatic to see blood and guns.  That&#39;s a piece of the chronology of the heartbreaking events that caused me to stumble here covered in fog and gray clouds wrapped in the night wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to find an outlet for the uncertainty I was experiencing.  It&#39;s true that I really can&#39;t cover up this feeling of confusion and distract it.  Until my feet stepped into a bar.  I ordered a large amount of beer.  I even spent my cash plus took out my credit card too.  I don&#39;t care about anything other than getting rid of this chaotic feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so drunk that I half-consciously met a man who was also as drunk as me.  Suddenly we approached each other and what I saw sometimes was that his face resembled Jeremy.  But it looks very far away if I look closely.  I don&#39;t know how we got into a room.  Obviously I forgot to remember because being under the influence of alcohol made me almost lose consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As far as I remember, now I am almost completely naked.  Leaving only bra and panties.  Slowly the man grabbed me by first biting my neck and licking it.  It makes me unable to sigh and it gets even worse than that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aaaahhh ahhhhh ahhhhh...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you like it?&#34;  Eyes that looked dim were increasingly lulled by the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;  I said without further ado even though I didn&#39;t know the man who was now playing with me at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started taking off my bra and threw it in any direction.  I could only surrender to enjoy an exciting night even though at first I was confused and felt uncontrollably depressed, I almost swallowed dozens of drugs beforehand but this man was the one who stopped me.  He even invited me to chat in a room I didn&#39;t recognize.  The time was so long, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up because I felt ticklish.  As I went in and deeper I started to feel wet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aaaahhh ahhh ahhh....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, come on, I&#39;m not satisfied yet!&#34;  I said, the charges are getting worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I will do that darling.&#34;  The man said as if he had known me for a long time, he even considered me his soul mate who was bound by the rules of marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept turning it from inside and going deeper and deeper until I felt stuck.  While enjoying the tongue swaying from inside the mouth.  Biting each other while embracing warmly and uniting their passions at one time.  He continued to thrust without withdrawing the slightest from inside me.  I felt this amazing and satisfied with the state of climax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dopamine hormone began to be produced perfectly.  No bad thoughts tonight.  Even now, I can only feel an indescribable sense of comfort.  He also seemed to enjoy and even really liked this game.  He pampered me more and more with his charm.  Until the long night it has released a lot of fluid.  I don&#39;t know how much went in but a lot of what came out wet the area of the bed we were using.  I already felt like I was almost out of breath with a feeling of pleasure.  There are only beautiful dreams.  Like soaring into the sky through the seventh heaven.  Spinning in feelings that are difficult for me to explain.  Until I fell asleep in that beautiful feeling.  Maybe that guy is the same as me.  Until I started to wake up when the night was almost over.  The world seemed to end in one glance at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34;  While pulling the blanket I was wearing, I pressed it to my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked under the blanket and it looked like I wasn&#39;t dressed at all.  I looked next to me, the man was still fast asleep.  I thought last night I had a dream, it turns out this was really real and it just happened.  The area around the edge of my mouth still smelled of the distinctive aroma of alcohol.  Looks like I drank too much beer last night.  So that caused me to lose control and make everything even more messy.  Bad thoughts about Jeremy&#39;s incident were slightly distracted by my current situation.  I don&#39;t even know if he got inside me.  It seemed like he had touched me deeply.  Until I had difficulty guessing how many were late.  I took a deep breath and started to get up from my sleeping position.  Sit for a moment to understand the flow of events that happened without this plan.  Once again looking at the man who was still asleep in his sleep.  He was next to me and seemed to be sleeping very comfortably.  Don&#39;t know what to do other than remain silent and pensive, lamenting this accidental incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I immediately put on my clothes in a hurry.  I hope it&#39;s finished quickly before the man next to me wakes up.  Even though I was feeling nervous and my body was shaking a little, I still continued wearing my clothes.  When everything was finished, I immediately got up and carried my small bag which I had kept on the bedside table.  I wanted to hurry and leave this man alone.  But there was a feeling of very high curiosity when I was about to leave.  Instantly I looked back at the man, perhaps he would be a part of my life in the future.  I stopped in my tracks and turned my gaze towards the man who was now fast asleep.  While looking at him closely there was a murmur in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He will be the father of my child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hah?  I immediately gasped after realizing that I had mumbled that deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did I say just now in my mind?  Am I saying it from my heart and deepest thoughts?  No!  I can&#39;t possibly have children from him.  But my mind forced me to look at the man more closely to make sure I could memorize his face.  Immediately I began to be disturbed by his behavior as if he was about to wake up.  I immediately felt panicked and immediately turned around and stepped forward hastily.  Hope he doesn&#39;t wake up soon before I actually get out and am far out there from this exit.  When I was about to take a step, I stepped on something.  A nameplate was still attached to the jacket which seemed to belong to the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo Bogdan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whispered softly on the edge of my lips.  Then my vision blurred and I immediately ran away from this room right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speeding up my footwork and walking hastily.  When I arrived in front of the door, I immediately opened it and walked out through the door after closing it.  I hope he doesn&#39;t come after me.</p>
