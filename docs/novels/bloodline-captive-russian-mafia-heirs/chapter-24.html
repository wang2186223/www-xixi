                <p>&#34;Lilianna, I&#39;m leaving for the next few hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34;  Suddenly I was shocked to hear that.  Maybe this has something to do with the contents of the phone call he got earlier.  It seems like something wrong is happening right now.  I&#39;m worried that something bad will threaten our existence while we are in Italy.  Hmm... it just bothers us who are on holiday.  Ruining the atmosphere of harmony that we have longed for for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought that Matteo wouldn&#39;t have time to explain everything to me.  But instead he explained what I wanted to know from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at this!&#34;  Matteo showed me a video like a CCTV recording.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was immediately curious to see it in more detail.  Trying to understand what really happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Russian boss has tracked our whereabouts here.&#34;  Matteo explained to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;  Suddenly I was shocked and started to worry about the possibility of what could happen next to us here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel bored and annoyed with this mafia world. Even though I really want to walk around in peace with you here. I want to give my child my time to go on holiday with him. But now again and again my time is being robbed by activities related to this mafia.  Really, on the other hand, I feel bored with all this. But what can I do? This has been my previous choice, so I will immediately clean up everything so that I can breathe fresh air and so that Callum is safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I understand your world. I hope everything can be resolved soon and you are not tied to the activities of the mafia. So that Callum&#39;s future is not threatened. I also actually feel that my feelings are going up and down. Because I think about your safety and the safety of my son Callum.&#34;  While glancing at Callum who was busy watching, he stared at the television screen with focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I hope so, Lilianna. Erm.. look at this! They went to the technician and the mafia boss left the car then went to the tech shop, leaving with a bag. After further backdating, he went every week at a certain time, his daughter was often with him.&#34;  Matteo again showed the video sent to him by an unknown person.  We immediately watch the video that has just come in together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So now what are you going to do in the face of all this chaos that has just started, Matteo?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will overcome everything and now I will go to see my friend who is also a mafia. He lives in Italy, I hope he can help me with this problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, I don&#39;t understand what all this means. Is Aelita also involved in her father&#39;s mafia group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, do you know the name of the Russian don&#39;s daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ouch, I almost forgot when I was talking to Matteo.  If I let it slip that I am the son of Alessio and the younger brother of Sillas who is going to marry Vlad Petrov&#39;s daughter, Aelita, then everything will be revealed.  I immediately pretended to divert my conversation to prevent Matteo from continuing to ask me questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to leave now, Matteo?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah, I almost forgot, I&#39;ll go and take good care of you and Callum here, Lilianna!&#34;  There was a look of worry in Matteo&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, okay, Matteo, I will make sure everything is safe here. Moreover, I feel safe in this room. Because there is strong protection at the entrance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I hope you&#39;re right. OK, I&#39;ll go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo immediately left here without saying goodbye to his son, Callum.  On purpose so that Callum wouldn&#39;t cry, he immediately left us without further ado.  He was gone for a few hours and it was just the two of us here.  Until morning arrived he was already in the room.  I was surprised by Matteo&#39;s sudden arrival.  It seemed like he came home very late last night.  Until I didn&#39;t hear and didn&#39;t know that he had come home here.  But it&#39;s okay, it&#39;s not an obstacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The most important thing is that now he can be here intact and safe.  Today we immediately planted our dreams on Italian soil.  Take a walk to a beautiful place and forget for a moment the noise that was going on in our brains for a while.  I want to get rid of my anxiety and have a fun trip with Matteo and Callum.  Today is a happy day for us.  Although yesterday he was tripped up because Matteo received a phone call from someone who threatened and terrorized him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Day after day, we have been in Italy for a week and are enjoying the fun atmosphere of our holiday.  In a week, I mean Matteo and his friends can solve the problems while they are here.  Until the day came when Matteo asked me to meet someone I didn&#39;t know.  It turns out he came to a technology store.  The tech guy seems eccentric and he asks if he&#39;s the new Don,  asking how they&#39;re taking over a woman&#39;s responsibilities.  He says he doesn&#39;t plan to stay, but that feels like a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna and Callum are coming too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where to?&#34;  I asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just come along!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until we arrived at the technology shop and met the technician.  The technician looked impeccably dressed and completely eccentric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry sir is the new Don?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, sure.&#34;  It seemed like Matteo was lying and acting in front of the technician to trick him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you take over Miss Aelita&#39;s responsibilities?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Obviously I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, then I will delegate everything to you and I will leave behind the responsibility that I have carried with Miss Aelita for a long time. I think that you, as a man, will be able to take care of it yourself, unlike women who need to be accompanied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah good, leave everything to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We talked in the car afterward, and Matteo told me that living with him wouldn&#39;t be so bad if it weren&#39;t for avoiding all the dangers that could happen at any time.  I also agreed to all his offers to stay with Callum too.  Besides, I don&#39;t know what will happen when I&#39;m away from my child.  I want to always be near him to make sure he is safe.  Moreover, currently Matteo is still involved in an extraordinarily dangerous mafia problem.  For this reason, I felt it was the right decision to stay with Matteo.  After one week we were in Italy.  So Matteo and I decided to take Callum back to Russia.  I hope there are no problems during the trip and until you get home.  I always hope that safety will always accompany the three of us.</p>
