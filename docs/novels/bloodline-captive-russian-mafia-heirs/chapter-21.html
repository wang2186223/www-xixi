                <p>Matteo&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today everything seems fine.  After the incident, my men infiltrated the house to trick Lilianna.  I accidentally took it from the Russian Don.  They are my spies and I want them to show themselves in one of the mysterious forms.  I turned everything around to disrupt the wedding of the Russian Don&#39;s daughter to Alessio&#39;s eldest son.  It seemed Lilianna was watching our conversation from behind her hiding place.  I hope she starts to feel no sympathy for the Russian Don and his daughter Aelita, who is predicted to become his future sister-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put some people in the Russian Don mafia group.  Deliberately to carry out my mission later.  I learned from my sophisticated father&#39;s experience.  I actually know now that Lilianna is the youngest child and Alessio&#39;s second child or she is none other than Sillas&#39; sister, the future daughter-in-law of the Russian Don.  I want to take Lilianna into my section.  Moreover, she is the mother of my child who I have to look after and care for.  If Lilianna gravitated towards the Russian Don mafia group based on her good relationship with her father then things would get very messy.  She might have the heart to attack me, who is the father of Callum&#39;s own child.  This is for the future of my child, one of the main factors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I was told to leave, Lilianna and several of my servants came out of her room.  As for Sophie, it seems like she was sleeping with Callum, so she didn&#39;t know and wasn&#39;t even aware that there had just been chaos here that could have claimed the life of one of us in this house.  However, I deliberately ordered them not to hurt, let alone kill, a single person in this house.  I have nothing to offer, I just hope there is a bluff and the scenario I have designed feels safe enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have also planned this carefully to attract Lilianna&#39;s sympathy and attention to stay in this house.  Erm... I think I&#39;m starting to believe that I fell in love with her after having sexual intercourse for the second time.  Even before we met again, in the end I had doubts about my feelings.  I deliberately did this scenario partly to make Lilianna worry about Callum.  Excessive worry will make her stay on standby here to make sure Callum is safe.  That way I have a reason and a lot of time to spend more time with her under one roof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilianna came out of her hiding place.  I saw that she looked different, her expression seemed to give me bad feelings.  But I don&#39;t care about that.  Later I will make her respect me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The men have left, now we are safe and you can breathe freely again.&#34;  I said to Lilianna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I saw they were gone. But why did you just let them go without holding them hostage or killing them? Isn&#39;t that dangerous in the future and could threaten the security of this house again?&#34;  She asked innocently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seems like she doesn&#39;t have intelligence.  So I don&#39;t need to bother arguing with her at length.  Later she will follow my path.  The flow that I have designed is such.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay Lilianna, do you still want to be here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I&#39;ll wait until Callum wakes up to make sure he doesn&#39;t mind if I leave him home later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, okay then, you can work together with Shopie. Meanwhile I will go to the office first to finish my work. Because I haven&#39;t been in the office for several days and neglected my work until it has piled up enough in the end. So I entrusted Callum to you and to Shopie. See you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, leave it all to me, I accept that responsibility and go finish your work. So that we can have lots of quality time with Callum. He seems to need refreshing and really needs us to take him to a recreation area once in a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a good idea, I agree. As soon as we get home from the office, we&#39;ll start discussing this issue again about plans for recreation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, ready, Matteo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left Lilianna.  Walked to my car which was parked in the garage and got into it to drive to the office.  I hope there are no obstacles on the road and there are no more robbers.  Because I brought a lot of things as support that I would give to Anthony.  It has been two days since Anthony finally resurfaced.  Even though he had previously disappeared when the mysterious incident occurred.  He is indeed my right hand man who is quite skilled and rather great.  I trusted him to smuggle things into the preparations for the Russian Don&#39;s daughter&#39;s wedding later.  I hope that our plan will not be in vain and that confidentiality will still be maintained so that it will not be leaked and someone will find out that there are items that will later be smuggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arrived at the office and met Anthony.  He disguised himself as someone I didn&#39;t recognize at all, even though his disguise was really packaged beautifully and neatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Matteo.&#34;  Someone tapped my shoulder rather gently from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34;  I was seriously shocked by this figure I didn&#39;t recognize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Anthony.&#34;  He whispered softly while speaking with his mouth half covered by his own hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;  I widened my eyes in complete surprise.  &#34;Are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes really, it&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re Anthony?&#34;  I followed Anthony&#39;s method and whispered softly so no one heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excellent.&#34;  While giving me a thumbs up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave the item to Anthony.  After it was over, I immediately said goodbye to go home because I didn&#39;t have much time outside because I was worried that something bad would happen again at my house.  I&#39;m a bit worried now that I was attacked and my house guard became the victim.  So now I don&#39;t want anyone to be a victim again, especially Callum and Lilianna.  They are now very important to me and will always be my main priority now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah no problem, go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do it all safely!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sneaked around and glanced here and there, hoping no one saw us here.  I went straight to my house and found Lilianna still at my house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, you&#39;re home, it turns out Matteo. Very quickly, you said, Your work is still piled up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have transferred the mandate to my subordinate and he is ready to handle it. Now I am free for the next few days or even more than a week, it seems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, that&#39;s great, it means we can accompany Callum on recreation for quite a long time. Maybe we can go out of town or abroad?&#34;</p>
