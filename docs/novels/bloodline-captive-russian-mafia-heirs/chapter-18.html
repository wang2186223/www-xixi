                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We could only remain silent and then Callum again asked us to do something that was impossible for us to do for him immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it.&#34;  He put it into practice.  Taking one of my hands and one of Matteo&#39;s hands to cross each other to hug him until our hands embraced each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed saliva as did Matteo.  The unusual feeling returned.  My lust suddenly began to surface.  I tried to hold it in.  Logic and feelings are at war right now.  Maybe Matteo also feels the same way as me.  But I didn&#39;t dare ask him about the truth of what he was feeling.  Moreover, we are now in front of Callum who is still small.  However, even though he is still small, Callum will definitely understand if we talk about things that are not normal for us to talk about.  I just swallowed it deep in my depths.  Trying to brush it off and trying more and more for it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Callum sleep okay!&#34;  I told my child to go to sleep immediately so that we could immediately be free from this situation which was making it difficult for us to move.  But to no avail, Callum didn&#39;t look sleepy at all and instead both of us started to feel sleepy because we were bored waiting for Callum to fall asleep.  Lastly I saw Matteo with dim eyes and then closed his eyelids and then fell asleep.  The same thing happened to me too.  Not long after Matteo was asleep, I followed him.  Feeling unbearably sleepy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until finally when we woke up I suddenly felt shocked, even very surprised because something unusual had happened between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aaaaaaaaaa.&#34;  I shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Likewise, Matteo also screamed, feeling as shocked as he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aaaaaaaaa.&#34;  Matteo shouted without letting go of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The appearance that is happening now is just me and Matteo hugging each other.  Callum&#39;s whereabouts are unknown.  I felt very surprised by all this.  For a moment my thoughts erased the part of Callum in my brain.  Now my libido is increasing and it seems like Matteo&#39;s too.  After we both felt shocked, suddenly we were swept away by an uncertain feeling, namely looking at each other and staring at each other from closeness and there was a quite erotic kiss between the two of us.  I really couldn&#39;t help it when Matteo brought his face closer to mine.  Likewise with Matteo, this happened as circumstances forced us to do.  Not one of us but this is purely a push and pull reaction between the two of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly we hear Sophie and Callum&#39;s voices outside this room.  Looks like Shopie has come and we are safe because Callum is clearly being looked after by Shopie.  I don&#39;t know what came over us both.  Matteo suddenly had the idea to lock the bedroom door from inside this room after hearing Callum and Sophie&#39;s voices earlier.   I actually felt happy seeing Matteo&#39;s efforts.  Then the two of us kissed each other and made feelings for each other while standing in a standing position and drowning in unbearable lust.  Matteo pushed me until my back touched the wall and leaned against the wall which was now behind me.  From the front, Matteo continued to grab me, even up to my neck, making everyone feel even more out of sorts.  I felt it rise to the top of my head and felt the sensation of Matteo&#39;s touch.  The two of us played an exciting game without remembering our unclear status.  Instantly thoughts about anything, including children, disappeared from our heads.  Now there is only a taste that makes us feel unbearable pleasure.  I was twisted by Matteo and we helped each other take off our clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo nodded at me signaling something to me.  Surprisingly, I immediately understood his gesture and also nodded my head.  Suddenly he lifted my body after all the clothes had come off with nothing left.  He carried me to the bathroom.  I hugged him and put both my arms around his neck.  He walked completely naked while holding my body, which was also completely naked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We finally reached the bathroom and found ourselves getting into the tub simultaneously and starting to turn on the shower to produce warm water that would fill us up nicely.  Started mixing soap into a tub filled with water and we were immersed in the beautiful atmosphere of bathing together.  Scene after erotic scene is happening right now in the bathtub.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw our reflections on the wall making love and making out in a charming scene without the slightest embarrassment or awkwardness.  We played for a long time in the bathroom and then Matteo came back on his lap after our bodies were completely clean of soap and had been rinsed with clean water.   I can&#39;t forget scene after scene that we did.  Feel very happy and very comfortable.  This is the longest intimate relationship we have had after having sex three years ago.  This is the second time we&#39;ve done it and really when our minds are away from the influence of alcohol.  Indeed, waking up is the most comfortable moment to do something beautiful like this.  Especially after you feel tired all day both mentally and physically due to the attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why have you left me since then for three years?&#34;  Matteo was angry with a spoiled tone at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget about that, the important thing is that we can now come back together and do everything with satisfaction.&#34;  I made fun of Matteo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Matteo lifted my body from the bath and walked to the bed after we finished wearing kimono towels.  This red kimono towel gives a hot and very exciting impression.  Until finally we arrived in front of the bed and Matteo threw my body onto the soft bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a jump when my body was slammed.  After bouncing on top, Matteo then crawled up my body very wildly.  I feel even more naughty and crazy now.  We show our dark side that was hidden.  I didn&#39;t expect that the two of us would both be aggressive figures when we were together like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We went crazy and had the hottest scene in a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aaaahh ahhh ahhh&#34; I sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo was heard and seen swallowing his saliva deeply.  It seems like his libido is increasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep going... keep going Matteo darling.&#34;  Without hesitation or embarrassment, I took her chin and neck and kissed her mouth area. I played with her tongue and we felt a very exciting sensation.</p>
