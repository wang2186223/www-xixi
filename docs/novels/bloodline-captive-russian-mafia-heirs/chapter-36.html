                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everyone was silent, finally someone tried to shoot my father Alessio and Sillas at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang bang bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad... Sillasss...&#34; Suddenly I screamed spontaneously without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wide-eyed by the sighting that occurred.  Suddenly I saw Matteo take out a gun and want to shoot at Aelita.  Instantly the Russian Don saw this.  He immediately tried to save Elita from Matteo&#39;s shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aelita, watch out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aelita bounced because she was pushed.  Meanwhile, the Russian Don almost got hit by a bullet but missed because he also fell.  The Russian Don immediately got up and chased Matteo.  Matteo came out running while leading and holding Callum and then carrying him on his lap.  Running strong and a chase going on outside.  The sound of gunfire never stopped.  I&#39;m worried about Callum and Matteo&#39;s condition.  But on the other hand, my father and Sillas had to be immediately rushed to the hospital because the gunshot wounds were quite serious in their chests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone inside scattered and some helped the gunshot victims.  I immediately rushed to take my father and Sillas to the hospital.  But unfortunately, both of them really couldn&#39;t be helped at all.  They died from being shot because it turned out that the bullets were very deadly and contained dangerous toxins that the body of the person who was shot could not tolerate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor came out of the room with a very gloomy expression on his face.  There was a feeling of weakness in the doctor who treated Father and Sillas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me, are you Miss Lilianna, the patient&#39;s family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s right, doc.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment the doctor was pensive and his eyes drooped downwards, indicating feelings of mourning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is it doc?&#34;  I immediately picked up the ball wanting the quickest answer from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Doctor shook his head and folded his lips and pressed them together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean? Tell me something about my father and my brother!&#34;  I half forced him to spontaneously raise my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, Miss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doc?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It can no longer be saved and...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean? Come on doc, do your best, I&#39;ll pay whatever it takes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t Miss, fate has said that Mr. Alessio and Mr. Sillas have died and can no longer be helped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt fragile and suddenly stiff all over my body.  Without anyone being able to wake me up, I went limp and felt like the earth was dark for a moment.  My body slumped down but didn&#39;t faint.  I couldn&#39;t believe the reality of this actually happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It couldn&#39;t be delayed any longer, the doctor immediately advised me to immediately take care of the process of eating my father and Sillas.  Because he had a gunshot wound which, if left for a little longer, the burns would spread to all parts of their body.  So it will be more difficult to take care of the body for burial later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately carried out the doctor&#39;s advice even though I felt very weak and lacking in strength.  Matteo and Callum suddenly came here.  I don&#39;t have the guts to be emotional or angry right now.  Don&#39;t discuss this issue any further with him.  He also took me to the funeral of my late father and Sillas.  I got out of the car while Matteo and Callum waited for me in the car.  Because he was worried that he would be in danger again if he came down and came to the funeral.  I don&#39;t mind that either.  In fact, they tend not to care if that is their decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after the funeral took place and finished.  I went straight back into Matteo&#39;s car and met Callum.  In the car, Matteo promised me he would fix everything and immediately regret what he did to my family.  I ignored his words because I was still grieving and felt like I was not grounded on earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna, I promise I will make things right, I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;  That&#39;s all my answer is short and very short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna, listen to me, I will accompany you in your next days. Don&#39;t worry, I will always be there for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;  Again and again I&#39;m reluctant to give a long response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Especially?&#34;  My tone suddenly rose because Matteo didn&#39;t stop babbling even though I responded very briefly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to visit the graves of your father and brother before we go home. Besides, I think it&#39;s safe outside and there&#39;s no one there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, whatever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and Callum are coming too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on! Look poor Callum wants to see his grandfather&#39;s grave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to look at Callum&#39;s face and finally said yes to Matteo and got out of the car to go back to my father&#39;s and Sillas&#39; graves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived in front of the grave, there was nothing strange.  Matteo prayed for my father and brother.  However, when he was about to go home and turned around just a few steps, suddenly something surprising happened.  Suddenly my father and Sillas&#39; graves exploded.  It looks like someone put a grenade in the chest.  God damn it!  Damn!  Who would do such a cruel thing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In addition, suddenly someone threw a homemade bomb at my father&#39;s and Sillas&#39; graves when we were about to look at what was happening behind us.  Suddenly it made Callum cry and Matteo immediately became furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It turned out that there were several people behind the tree and in several places almost surrounding our position.  Suddenly it surprised us like that was what someone ordered.  They fled before the confrontation.  Just as Matteo was about to clean his wounds, he was hit by a few sparks from the homemade bomb explosion.  Suddenly Matteo said something to you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna, I have done a lot of harm and disappointment to your family. I&#39;m sorry! I couldn&#39;t avoid this bad fate, especially since the Russian mafia boss is too powerful and I feel there&#39;s nothing I can do to anticipate all this. But don&#39;t worry, next I will take over his leadership.&#34;  Then kissed my forehead with deep guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo.&#34;  My eyes were teary and it was hard to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna, honestly, I never wanted this bad thing to happen, but circumstances forced it to happen. But I promise I will take responsibility for all this chaos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just cried automatically without being able to hold it in anymore.  Meanwhile Matteo hugged me and Callum too.  Another time, after we had arrived at his house for some time, Matteo immediately held an important meeting with the higher-ups who would help him resolve all these problems.  I can now only accept the bitter reality that has just happened to my family.  I just entrust everything to Matteo.  I believe that there is still a good side in him.  Because he is the father of my child, there is no way he wants to destroy my life on purpose.  So I left everything in Matteo&#39;s hands.  I don&#39;t dare voice my opinion because I don&#39;t know what the real mafia world is like.  I&#39;m too blind for things like that.  So that&#39;s all Matteo&#39;s next business.</p>
