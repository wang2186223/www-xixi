                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since we received Sillas&#39; blessing.  It was time for him to get married to Aelita.  Now Sillas will marry the daughter of the Russian Don.  I feel really bad today.  Starting to reveal everything that will happen.  But it&#39;s hard to prevent it from actually becoming a reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sillas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, what&#39;s wrong, Lilianna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to say something to him based on my knowledge and gut feeling but stopped.  Especially when someone called Sillas to come out immediately and we would rush to the altar to hold Sillas and Aelita&#39;s wedding there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knock knock knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father&#39;s confidant picked Sillas up in his room.  I immediately turned to look at him and had difficulty speaking again after he came to tell Sillas that we had to go to the altar immediately.  Because Don&#39;s Russian family had been waiting for us there and had arrived a few minutes ago to inform my father by telephone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sillas, come on! Boss Alessio has ordered you to immediately take you to the altar. I will drive the car and you as the bride and groom just have to sit back and relax until we get there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, okay, have the bride&#39;s family arrived at the altar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, they just called Alessio&#39;s boss and said they arrived at the altar a few minutes ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, okay. You go downstairs first! Lilianna and I will follow you down soon too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person sent by my father went first according to Sillas&#39; request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sillas went back to fixing his appearance by fixing the jacket and tie he was wearing.  He was still standing in front of the mirror while I was not far from beside him standing still watching him fix his appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t have much time to talk now.  But I felt like I really wanted to say something to Sillas.  Before everything actually happens and I will feel regret after the bitter reality hits my family later.  After finishing fixing herself, Sillas immediately walked out of her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Lilianna!&#34;  He walked first and while I was still staring at the side of the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he was about to take a few steps towards the door of his room to get out of here.  I suddenly opened my mouth to make a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sillas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, what else is there?&#34;  Sillas immediately turned towards me, turning his neck and turning his head back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eee.. no! You forgot to wear this.&#34;  Suddenly I became stiff and my tongue felt loose and I had difficulty continuing my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked towards him and put a fresh red rose right in his jacket pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah, I almost forgot.&#34;  Sillas said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Lilianna, for remembering me.&#34;  he continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes of course, you&#39;re welcome, Sillas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paired it with slightly shaking hands.  I can&#39;t hide the true feelings I&#39;m experiencing in my feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at Sillas full of stiffness.  But he seems busy with himself.  Without being able to pay attention to the movements of my eyes and the signals I convey through my eyes.  But I understand it because it&#39;s the day before the wedding takes place.  He was very enthusiastic and looked a little nervous and stuttered in doing something.  Maybe he is starting to feel nervous about the time when he will make a sacred promise to live and die with his partner later.  It will open new paths and pages.  Starting a new life with his soul mate.  But no, Sillas was completely mistaken about his fate and destiny.  I&#39;m already having a hard time saying everything that could have happened at the wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Lilianna! Why have you been silent and daydreaming a lot? Aren&#39;t you happy that your brother is getting married soon? Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um no! That&#39;s not what Sillas is, I didn&#39;t mean it like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was silence without an answer.  Suddenly Sillas waved his hand in front of my face and invited me to immediately hurry down and get into the car that had been provided by my father&#39;s men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah never mind, it&#39;s not that important. Come on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turned around and walked a little hastily.  Likewise, I quickened my steps so I could catch up with Sillas&#39;s very hasty steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We immediately got into the car after arriving downstairs.  So that the event doesn&#39;t drag on and take up a lot of time while traveling.  Moreover, I am worried that the roads will be jammed today considering it is the weekend.  We immediately went to the altar to fulfill Sillas and Aelita&#39;s wedding plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arriving at the altar, our group and I immediately went down and went to the altar and entered.  There are many people here who want to witness Sillas and Aelita&#39;s wedding.  The bride-to-be looked beautiful in the dress I had brought as her order. Aelita looks luxurious but still elegant.  Beside her was Vlad Petrov, who was the father of my late lover.  He once refused me to be his daughter-in-law when my father and he were having a big conflict which was very heated and escalated.  But with Sillas he even wanted to make him his son-in-law.  The world really isn&#39;t fair to me.  But it&#39;s okay because now Matteo is in my life.  Callum&#39;s existence is much more valuable than Jeremy&#39;s existence.  Callum gave me hope to stay alive in all the possibilities that life might bring.  I felt like I had to endure it and wanted to float it until it grew up.  He makes me enthusiastic to live this life which is clearly not easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we arrived at the altar and the wedding process was about to take place, there was nothing that made me hesitate here.  Everything seems fine.  But when Aelita and Sillas were about to go to the podium to tie the knot.  Suddenly I saw a figure I knew among the group of people present at this altar.  He smiled at me and waved his hand slowly.  I saw Matteo and next to him carrying Sillas.  Huh?  Why was he able to attend and be invited by... By whom?  Was it the Russian Don who invited him?  Or my father?  Um, maybe Sillas?  Hmmm... I don&#39;t know, let it go.  Obviously he didn&#39;t do anything that I didn&#39;t want to happen at my sister&#39;s wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Aelita and Sillas had arrived at the front and faced the priest.  Suddenly there was a big explosion from outside.  Making everyone inside panic and immediately lay down without being instructed by anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lie down!!!&#34;  Someone told you to get down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also lay down and while holding my head covered my ears spontaneously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly a group of mafia came into the altar and started causing chaos.  Pointing the gun they were carrying at certain people they were targeting.  Those who were targeted were told to stand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Raise your hands!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put down weapons!&#34;   Some tried to fight back by taking out weapons from their pockets.</p>
