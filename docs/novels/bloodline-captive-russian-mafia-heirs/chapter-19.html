                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started to wake up after having sex with Matteo and it was very hot.  I immediately rushed away to avoid Matteo and ran outside to immediately go home.  I felt ashamed of myself after starting to realize that we had been in an illicit relationship for the second time.  My mind became confused and a little naive.  I decided to throw the feeling of uncertainty away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately put on all my clothes that had all been taken off.  Put it on immediately and don&#39;t remember anything other than the embarrassment that emerged.  Now I have finished wearing my clothes.  I immediately pulled out to get out of here right now.  Rushing off, Matteo was left alone, who was clearly confused because he saw my behavior suddenly change drastically, with no clear direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Lilianna... Where are you going?&#34;  Apparently Matteo wasn&#39;t conscious yet and was still trapped in his lust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still half-dressed and only wearing trousers.  After seeing me go towards the exit of this room.  He immediately hurriedly put on his clothes and then got up to follow me.  I was caught up and he grabbed my hand tightly from behind.  We were silent for a moment and I froze for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going? What&#39;s wrong with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let Matteo go! We shouldn&#39;t do it a second time.&#34;  My tone was curt and cold while looking straight ahead without the slightest interest in turning back to Matteo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly I immediately turned towards him, turned my head and turned it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, why do you say that? Listen, Matteo! Listen to this carefully! Do you think it&#39;s a commendable thing to do all this outside of marriage? If it was done the first time it was clear it was an accident but if it was done the second time it was stupid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to marry you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately let go of his grip and turned my whole body again and accelerated my steps towards the exit without further ado. I now didn&#39;t care about Matteo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking with dark feelings and dilemmas.  I got into my car and without looking left or right.  I didn&#39;t even have time to say goodbye to my son Callum.  I didn&#39;t think about anything other than feeling confused and confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I&#39;m in the car and driving myself at an unusual speed.  However, I still arrived safely at my house.  Until I found my father sitting facing the front porch smoking and accompanied by a cup of hot coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna, you&#39;re home.&#34;  My father said lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmm, actually I wanted to go to my room after arriving but apparently my father didn&#39;t like that.  Instead he called me to sit down with him and say something important to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come and sit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, Dad...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t refuse it because I was worried it would trigger something unwanted.  Dad will be very angry if I don&#39;t comply with his request.  Even though I felt lazy, I approached my father and sat in the chair next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know Sillas will be getting married soon, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you and I want you as one of my heirs to be part of my business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean, Dad?&#34;  I suddenly turned towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean you have to join my mafia group and I will teach you various ways to become a reliable mafia and share my experience and knowledge in the business field.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? No dad! I don&#39;t want to!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Lilianna I really hope that happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to anyway!&#34;   Left father without permission and just walked away.  But my father didn&#39;t get angry and instead gave me the opportunity to review and think again about the offer and request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just think about it first, think again and I&#39;ll wait for your answer later!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t care about my father&#39;s voice and went into my room without paying attention to Sillas who asked me when I passed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my bedroom door from the inside and started to lay my body down on the bed.  I feel crummy and tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long time of contemplation, suddenly the sound of gunshots came into the house.  I was shocked and immediately got up because I was shocked and peeked out from behind my bedroom door.  Outside there was chaos.  But my father and Sillas and my father&#39;s men were able to stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang bang bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shot after shot went off.  Makes the heart beat faster.  But finally everything was finished without taking long.  I sat back on my bed and didn&#39;t care about everything that had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly my cell phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw from Matteo, hmm... I didn&#39;t want to pick it up.  At least he wanted to apologize to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But suddenly a text message came to my cell phone.  I read that Callum was crying looking for me.  Suddenly I immediately felt out of sorts.  Without thinking, he rushed back to Matteo&#39;s house and almost forgot about the incident with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was too hasty in driving and finally arrived at Matteo&#39;s house.  Sure enough Callum was crying while calling me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, Mom...&#34; shouted a little shrill while whining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here!&#34;  I immediately grabbed him and hugged him.  He was still crying and felt short of breath.  I felt guilty that I had forgotten about it because of my confused feelings for Matteo earlier.  I&#39;m really selfish as a mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally Callum stopped crying even though he was still sobbing a little and sobbing.  I kept holding him to calm him down.  Gradually he started sleeping on my lap.  I gave it to Sophie to sleep with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shopie, take Callum and put him to sleep in his room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Sophie left, Callum went to his room, so Matteo came over to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you answer my phone once?&#34;  He seemed a bit annoyed with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer him and didn&#39;t consider him present here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that since you left, Callum hasn&#39;t stopped crying. Do you really have a heart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately turned to Matteo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Callum is just a child who doesn&#39;t know anything about his parents&#39; problems.&#34;  He brought his face closer to mine, making me swallow saliva without being able to dodge or get away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me!&#34;  Suddenly the words came out of my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly Matteo dragged me to the basement.  I couldn&#39;t let go of his grip and instead followed his steps.  He showed many weapons in this warehouse.  Then he started telling me some of his secrets without me asking him to tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m taking revenge on the Russian Mafia.&#34;</p>
