                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I found Callum still awake and safe, I immediately took him into this cupboard.  I felt very guilty and I immediately hugged him and took him to the first floor to gather downstairs with Matteo and the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost made Matteo explode with anger.  But Callum&#39;s presence in my lap made him melt.  Now Matteo is still in a state where his anger is starting to subside.  Because just now he was played by circumstances that forced him to focus on two different places.  For him, Callum is a valuable treasure, but Anthony is just as important to him, maybe that&#39;s what I suspect from Matteo&#39;s thoughts right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Callum.&#34;  Her eyes filled with tears and she started hugging Callum and forgot that Callum was in my lap.  He was so panicked and worried about Callum that he forgot that I&#39;m not his wife and he hugged you both.  In fact, at first I was also caught unaware by this situation.  But suddenly my conscious thoughts began to emerge and appear again.  My eyes widened, feeling awkward with Matteo&#39;s attitude now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, sorry Matteo, please let go of your hug, I&#39;m very uncomfortable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of several people, including the waiter and the gardener, everyone here watched the three of us chatting together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh, sorry.&#34;  Matteo threw away his embrace and began to realize that we were actually no one, I mean, we were not related to anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was seen swallowing his saliva, then Matteo spoke again to divert everyone&#39;s attention so as not to focus on the scene earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we&#39;ve all divided up the tasks. Some are in charge of cleaning up, some are in charge of collecting the bodies. I will call the officers outside to evacuate these bodies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We also share tasks with each other.  Until finally all the tasks were finished and we could enjoy a short break before finally having to clean ourselves because our bodies were full of sweat.  Meanwhile, I was assigned just to wait for Callum who was still asleep so I didn&#39;t sweat too much but still felt sticky because I was so panicked when the incident happened until Matteo finished off their gang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until finally Matteo came into this room to meet Callum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything okay?&#34;  I asked Matteo when he hadn&#39;t had time to sit down and had only taken a few steps into this room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, finished, hmm, quite tiring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whose order was that? Why did you mess up here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a very long story Lilianna, you won&#39;t possibly understand what has happened in my life to cause all this chaos to happen now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, okay, I won&#39;t ask any further. It&#39;s just that I&#39;m worried that one day something bad will happen to us again, I mean I&#39;m worried about Callum&#39;s safety. What if there are people who have a grudge against you and at any time stalk Callum after they find out that Callum is  your flesh and blood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m also thinking the same thing as you, Lilianna. I&#39;m also worried about Callum&#39;s fate. My steps are now limited, unlike before when I felt I had no responsibility in looking after my child. But now I&#39;m caught up in my moral responsibility to my son Callum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s what I mean. There are two worries in my mind. The first is about Callum and the second is about you as his father. Callum&#39;s life is in danger as is yours. I don&#39;t want anything bad to happen to you as Callum&#39;s father. Because Callum really needs him.  father figure. If you&#39;re okay, I&#39;m really sad to see Callum losing his biological father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo was pensive when he heard my words which might penetrate his heart.  He wasn&#39;t like usual, this time there was a lot of burden on his face.  I don&#39;t know what to do now.  Apart from just waiting for a response from Matteo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, accompany Callum to sleep here! You won&#39;t go home, will you and will you spend the night here to accompany Callum?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Em, that&#39;s what I want, Matteo. Later, I&#39;ll tell you my decision whether you can stay overnight or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo was about to leave to leave the two of us in the room.  But suddenly Callum woke up and called his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eeee... Dad.&#34;  Rubbing his eyes he whined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo stopped his footsteps for a moment, froze for a moment and then turned his body towards us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy&#39;s son is awake, isn&#39;t he?&#34;  Matteo smiled and then approached Callum who was still lying next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, don&#39;t go! You have to stay here!&#34;  Callum said, asking his father to remain silent in this room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But dad has to do something else outside. Mom is here to accompany Callum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy...&#34; While whining, he asked to stay with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want mom and dad to be here,&#34;  he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, Matteo and I really felt out of style and embarrassed by him.  Feeling confused about what to do, especially if there is no important discussion between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad&#39;s here!&#34;  Moved his hand to call Matteo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bu... But...&#34; Matteo seemed very forced to obey Callum&#39;s wishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was getting more and more out of style when Callum told Matteo to lie down next to him.  Meanwhile, now my position is lying next to Callum.  So that means that now our position is facing each other towards Callum who is now between us in the middle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obviously I felt uncomfortable because it couldn&#39;t be denied that Matteo was a new person to me.  We have never been in a relationship, let alone dating, let alone married.  So it&#39;s fitting that I feel really uncomfortable with our current situation.  But what can be done about this is Callum&#39;s desire which cannot be negotiated or opposed.  He would cry if we refused his request.  In fact, we were worried that Callum would be very disappointed if we showed an attitude as if we were really limiting ourselves.  Matteo and I have to look good in front of Callum, like a husband and wife who are father and mother to Callum and play the role of complete parents and have their respective gender positions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although on the other hand I feel uncomfortable actually being in a position like this.  But Callum is just a child who doesn&#39;t know anything about what has happened between us all this time.  He is not old enough to know the ins and outs of what happened between his parents.  I feel bad as a mother for Callum.  In fact, it was very clear that my father had arranged a marriage with the daughter of his business partner.  So it&#39;s really impossible for me to unite with Callum&#39;s father.  I think it would be impossible if I could one day marry Matteo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hug!&#34;  Callum is getting worse and making us confused.</p>
