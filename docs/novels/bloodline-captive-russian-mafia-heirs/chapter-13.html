                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just focused on my son Callum when Matteo was answering the phone call he got from Anthony&#39;s contact, that&#39;s what I heard.  Because Matteo mentioned Anthony&#39;s name repeatedly.  The name was familiar because Matteo had mentioned it a few days ago when he was going to the casino.  It seems like Matteo and the person named Anthony have a very close relationship.  Whether as a business partner or friend.  I don&#39;t know and don&#39;t want to know more about many things about Matteo&#39;s personal affairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anthony? What happened?&#34;  Matteo looked panicked and started to change his expression to become erratic.  He called while pacing like an iron.  Because he was so restless, one of his hands wouldn&#39;t stop moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang bang bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was another continuous sound of gunfire.  It seems like there is chaos behind the cell phone.  I mean Anthony is in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo hung up the phone and started to come back towards me while shouting for Shopie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shopieeee... Shopieeee....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie approached Matteo hastily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong Matteo, you called me while shouting like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stay here with Lilianna and take good care of Callum! I have something to go out first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Matteo, I have to go home first because I have urgent matters at home. My mother called me to go home first. Maybe I will come here again if possible in the afternoon or tomorrow morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Em... Can&#39;t it be cancelled?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way, Matteo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well that&#39;s that then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo left Shopie and started to approach me and told me to stay here until it was time for Matteo to come back to this house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Em... Lilianna, you look after Callum here, I have some business to go out first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah go, Callum is safe with his mother.&#34;  I smiled faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw that Matteo froze and opened his cell phone to enter someone&#39;s contact, whether on an application or website, he could track on GPS the location and location of the owner of the contact.  It looks like Matteo is confirming Anthony&#39;s whereabouts now.  It didn&#39;t take long for him to succeed and was still standing still in front of us, not far from the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, please continue eating! Dad will go first, Callum will be nice to mom here, okay?&#34;  Rubbed his son&#39;s head gently then kissed his forehead and immediately left us.  Matteo immediately rushed out of the house and heard that a few minutes later his car engine was starting and it seemed like he was driving fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna, I&#39;m going home first. I hope Callum is fine with you here. I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to let go of my responsibility in looking after Callum. But my mother has been waiting for me for a long time. I&#39;m going somewhere to  I&#39;m attending an important event with my mother. So I hope you stay here with my Callum until Matteo or I come back here, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, Sophie, you don&#39;t need to worry. Callum will be safe with me, I&#39;m his mother and I&#39;ll leave all of Callum&#39;s affairs to me. Go on and hopefully you&#39;ll always be awake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Lilianna, thank you for your understanding and hopes. Hopefully everything will come true and each of us will be fine, whether it&#39;s me, you and Callum and Matteo. Even though we are in different places, I hope we are still safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at Shopie and Shopie smiled back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;ll go home now okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie immediately rushed out.  I feel strange now being in someone else&#39;s house.  But even so, Callum can be a quiet solace for me.  We continued our eating activities which had been stopped.  I thought to myself that it was a shame that Matteo hadn&#39;t had time to eat breakfast.  I mean he only ate two bites.  Someone suddenly called him and then had to go out for an unpredictable amount of time until the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finished eating and now it&#39;s my turn to help Callum finish his meal.  Earlier Callum asked not to be helped and he felt he could eat with his own hands without needing help from his mother as an adult.  But now I see that the way he eats is not good.  So I decided to help him finish eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need help, son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum nodded and pushed the plate in front of him towards me by moving it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, come here, mom, help me so you can eat quickly, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also fed Callum and I wanted to feed Callum.  Several mouthfuls went into his mouth.  But suddenly he refused to open his mouth again when I shoved a spoon filled with food into his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Callum full?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;  While nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, let&#39;s have a drink first.&#34;  I gave him a drink and pushed the glass to his mouth.  Callum drank very enthusiastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few minutes I asked him to go upstairs to his bedroom.  I want to invite him to play with robots in his room first.  Because I had just finished eating, I was worried that my stomach would still feel full if I went straight to bed.  Because it&#39;s starting to be noon, this is the time for Callum to get regular with his nap schedule so he still feels fresh and napping for children is good for brain development.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dear Callum, let&#39;s play with robots in the room!&#34;  Take me gently to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on.&#34;  He was so enthusiastic and very enthusiastic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Mom, put Callum downstairs first, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted Callum&#39;s waist to help him get off the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hiyyaaaa, my master of flying and landing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha ha ha ha.&#34;  He laughed so loudly and seemed very happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let!&#34;  I took his hand and we started walking towards the stairs of this house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s walk Callum, don&#39;t carry him all the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;  While nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was beside me and we walked side by side.  Until we were in front of the first step.  I positioned Callum in front of me so that he would be monitored and not fall when climbing these stairs one by one.  He was willing and started walking while jumping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eh, don&#39;t jump up and down! You&#39;ll fall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He obeyed my words and started walking normally, taking one step at a time from one step to another above him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I iam very tired, ma&#39;am.&#34;  Stop at the top five steps almost to the end.  His legs are straightened and his body is bent while his hands are placed on his knees.  His breathing was irregular and he was panting with exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a little longer, come on, Mom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got up again and stood straight, then continued his steps.  Until finally we arrived at the second street of this house.</p>
