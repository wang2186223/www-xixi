                <p>Matteo&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprisingly, I wasn&#39;t angry and immediately paid it in advance.  In fact, I even moved from my position after completing the transaction at the cashier&#39;s desk which was not far from my sitting position.   He staggered around and then found a beautiful girl who also seemed to be very drunk.  I started to be captivated by him and attracted to him.  I got to know him and then took him to play in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Miss, what&#39;s your name?&#34;  Without shame, I immediately stabbed the woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I have to mention it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34;  I pulled her hand so that she was close to my body and even felt her breasts pressed against my chest.  Our faces looked at each other and chatted in one glance which almost made us busy in this unforgettable atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Lilianna, just call me Lilianna.&#34;  Smiling weakly looking at me.  &#34;You?&#34;  While wrapping both hands around my neck without the slightest shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Matteo Bogdan Castello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had time to chat with unclear topics and seemed to be going here and there.  Until finally we walked into the room and made love tonight with passion and passion that could no longer be contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s really crazy, I did it with someone I just met.  I even knew him unconsciously.  Won&#39;t this add to our future problems?  I mean will I get into new problems if I have a relationship with this woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I no longer care about other bad possibilities that could happen and happen to me.  Obviously, tonight I want to enjoy my confused feelings by making love all night to relieve stress and excessive fear and anxiety regarding my father&#39;s behavior in the future.  I&#39;m just mentally preparing and refilling ammunition tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight is a night that is hard for me to forget.  I feel pleasure after pleasure tonight.  Even though I was playing with people I had just met and we were even semi-conscious.  But it feels different and I feel that he will be my soul mate in the future.  I don&#39;t know why there are thoughts like that in the midst of this almost dull consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Game after game felt very fun and made me very comfortable.  Until sleepiness creeps in at the end of the game.  I started to become completely unconscious and fell asleep in a drowsiness that was really difficult for me to prevent at all.  I don&#39;t know what happened to this woman after I became unconscious because I was fast asleep.  But clearly I didn&#39;t find him when I woke up from my sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna?&#34;  I muttered after I got up from my sleeping position and was still sitting on this bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled lightly after imagining and feeling last night which was full of romance which made me very comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly I started to wake up and jumped out of bed.  Then immediately put my clothes back on.  Then immediately ran out after making sure I didn&#39;t leave any of my things in this room.  I immediately ran after the woman.  I hope he&#39;s not far from here and just woke up before I woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, it looks like it&#39;s him, I started shouting at him but he accelerated his steps without even looking back.  I chased him and we were now in the parking lot.  I held his hand from behind.  Until it made him stop and not continue on his path.  He had difficulty taking another step and instead stood with his back to me who was also standing still facing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you leave me alone in the room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer my question and was still frozen without making the slightest movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if you are pregnant with my child?&#34;  I spontaneously said that to the woman who was now in front of me.  He immediately turned around as if he was shocked by the words I just said.  Frowning as if asking me to repeat what I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if what happened last night made you pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t pretend you don&#39;t understand Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, do you know my name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Obviously, last night we got to know each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it true?&#34;  He seemed surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then later denied what I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I could never be pregnant with your child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, we&#39;ll see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can contact me if it is proven that my words are true. Here is my business card, there is a cell phone contact that you can contact.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s ridiculous that I suddenly gave my business card and contact details to a new person I&#39;ve known since last night, accidentally and even in a semi-conscious state.  This is really crazy and I don&#39;t know what the rest of our story will be like.  I poked at my business card but he looked at my business card without moving at all.  It seemed like he had no intention of taking it.  I immediately put it in his shirt pocket.  Immediately rushed to leave him alone.  He was still standing still when I looked at him for the last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just walked away and left him alone in a state where he seemed confused about what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was actually confused about what to do now apart from going home and facing the reality that I would receive from my father later at home.  All the way home I found the image of the woman named Lilianna constantly looming in my mind and made an impression that was difficult for me to shake off.  My thoughts were only focused on him and what happened last night.  Hope there will be a next meeting.  I have the hope of meeting that beautiful woman named Lilianna again.  I think there will be a longer relationship after this.  I don&#39;t know why my feelings have become so chaotic like this.  Like being drugged by something really intoxicating.  Is this part of the effects of the drink I drank too much last night?  But it seems like Lilianna really has her own charm that makes it hard for me to forget her even for a moment, who knows in the future.  I found myself paralyzed by feelings that I did not predict beforehand, that this would just appear in a matter of one night.  I was really curious about this woman and felt like I had an inner attachment to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now my problems yesterday afternoon began to be distracted by Lilianna&#39;s presence in my life.  I&#39;m starting to feel like my problems are not so difficult to face now.  Even though I&#39;m still clearly confused about facing my father in the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked towards the door of my house after arriving in front of my gate using an online taxi.  Trying to get rid of all feelings of anxiety and anxiety.  I hope my father won&#39;t make me feel like the stupidest person in the world.  I arrived at the house and found my father waiting for me and welcoming me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, that&#39;s just the first experience. Next you will go to the second experience.&#34;  While clapping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t even understand the meaning of what my father just said.  I frowned and just waited silently for my father to say something more that would make me understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t think that I will be disappointed and end everything. I will give you a new assignment.&#34;  He said to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;New assignment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, new assignment.&#34;  While smiling, looking straight ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of being disappointed and feeling wronged by me.  Dad will actually add to my burden again.  I really don&#39;t understand his thoughts.</p>
