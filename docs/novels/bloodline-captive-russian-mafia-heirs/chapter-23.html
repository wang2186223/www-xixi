                <p>After planning our departure yesterday for a holiday to Italy with Callum.  Now Matteo, Callum and I go straight to the airport to depart according to the flight schedule recorded on the ticket that has been ordered.  Callum looks happy and happy.  Moreover, he was accompanied by complete parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is the first time on holiday with Matteo and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going to take a plane, okay ma&#39;am?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Callum, soon we will be flying in the air.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hooray...&#34; Callum was very excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Callum likes it?&#34;  Matteo asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Callum likes it especially when there&#39;s Mom and Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo and I became embarrassed when Callum said that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So where is Callum going now?&#34;  Matteo broke everything up by asking Callum again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did we go,  ma&#39;am?  I forgot?&#34;  Callum asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To Italy, Callum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes, to Italy dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hooray, soon we will arrive in Italy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hooray. ..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go for a walk there later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt touched watching the closeness of father and son before my eyes.  This is the moment I&#39;ve been longing for since the moment Callum started to exist inside me.  The void that once existed in Callum&#39;s life has now been paid for and is starting to be filled with the presence of Matteo as his father beside Callum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trip to Italy now starts from the moment we enter the plane and sit quietly.  According to the flight schedule, the plane now started to fly and flap its wings until we were in the air.  I saw a very beautiful view outside the plane.  But Callum&#39;s smile beats the beauty of it all.  I really felt happy seeing Callum so enthusiastic and there was joy radiating on his innocent face.  I saw Matteo busy chatting with Callum without realizing that I suddenly smiled at this warm appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t feel like time had brought our bodies to land and arrived in Italy safely.  We started rushing to get off the plane after the flight attendant asked us to get off.  The three of them walked together and guided Callum to each other.  Walk along the airport and until you reach outside the airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, I am hungry.&#34;  While holding his stomach with his small and tiny hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, okay, then let&#39;s start our route to the restaurant for lunch, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s better that way, let&#39;s fill our stomachs first so we can have energy while walking.&#34;  I said adding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, let&#39;s go to this famous restaurant in Italy! Let&#39;s go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for Matteo to immediately order a taxi online for us to immediately go to the restaurant he was referring to.  An online taxi came to us a few minutes later after Matteo ordered it to take us to the restaurant.  We immediately got on and drove to where we wanted to go.  Until we arrived in front of the restaurant, which was very magnificent and very luxurious.  It looks like Matteo will spend a lot of money to be able to pay for the food we ordered at this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without delay, we immediately got out of the car and entered the restaurant.  Started looking for a comfortable place for us to eat.  Finally we found a place that we felt would make us comfortable when eating later.  Then the waiter approached us and asked what menu we would choose to eat.  Matteo asked me to choose myself and I chose food that was suitable for Callum to consume.  While waiting for the food to be delivered to our table.  Matteo invited Callum to chat so he wouldn&#39;t get bored.  Meanwhile, I could only watch the excitement of them joking around.  They look very united and it makes the heart peaceful when they see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The food finally arrived in front of us and without further ado because we were both hungry.  We immediately devoured the food served before our eyes without hesitation.  Occasionally I help Callum to eat because there are some things he can&#39;t do.  At the end of our meal, we were suddenly disturbed by the loud sound of Matteo&#39;s cell phone ringing which kept vibrating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t pick up?&#34;  While chewing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Erm, just leave it for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s probably important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm, yes, that&#39;s it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo got up from his seat while whispering half-annoyedly at the unknown caller.  While taking the cell phone from his pocket, he stood up and then looked at the cell phone screen with a puzzled look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t know, the number is new, still unfamiliar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, just pick it up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;ll answer the phone first.&#34;  Walk a few steps away from your original position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While accompanying Callum to eat because I had finished eating myself.  Every now and then I glanced at Matteo because I was worried that something bad would happen after Matteo answered the mysterious phone call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t hear what Matteo was talking about with the caller.  But suddenly Matteo came with an expression that was less than wearing. He suddenly invited us to immediately leave here and find a place to stay where we could rest.  I didn&#39;t even dare ask what he heard from behind the phone.  I just followed the path he would take us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna, Callum, are you done eating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes of course, we&#39;ve finished eating. What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, it&#39;s better if we just look for a hotel first to use as a place to rest. Just a hotel around here, I&#39;ll book it online so I can quickly get the one that meets your expectations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, but why? Aren&#39;t you going to take us on a trip to a tourist spot first?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s starting to get late and the weather isn&#39;t favorable, just look outside! We&#39;d better save our dream of traveling and rest at the hotel so that our bodies will be fitter so that tomorrow we can travel anywhere all day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, okay then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Callum wants to go for a walk now!&#34;  While sulking about his father&#39;s promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Callum, tomorrow, okay?&#34;  While stroking Callum&#39;s hair, he brought his face closer to Callum&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum shook his head and folded his arms.  Turning her head away from Matteo while pouting.  Matteo then got up and looked at me.  We looked at each other and hinted at something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Callum, let&#39;s rest first. Mom will give Callum something when we get to the hotel.&#34;  I persuaded my son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately jumped and put his arms around my neck.  Starting to get spoiled and wanting to be carried.  I was forced to carry him until I got into the online taxi that had been ordered and walked until we arrived at the hotel that Matteo had chosen as a place for us to rest in peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walk through the lobby and arrive at the front of the room.  Matteo attached a card so we could go inside immediately.  We finally went into the room and started packing up our luggage.  As for Callum, I let him watch television by watching his favorite cartoon.  Matteo suddenly said goodbye to go out after everything was almost finished here.</p>
