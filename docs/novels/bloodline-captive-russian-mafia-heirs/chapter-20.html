                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, I was suddenly shocked because the Russian Don was my father&#39;s future in-laws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I needed a lot of people to complete my mission. I tried to unite my father&#39;s men. But no one wanted to join the structure and some of them challenged the structure and became traitors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to absorb the explanation explained by Matteo.  I wonder where it will take me.  So what does this have to do with me and the activities he is currently involved in?  Although I wasn&#39;t too surprised to hear that Matteo was part of a mafia union and was one of its leaders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some people are against it because there are those who are pro the Russian Don in-laws.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He doesn&#39;t realize that I am Alessio&#39;s son.  But I would rather choose to remain silent and not reveal my true identity.  I just wanted to hear where Matteo&#39;s thoughts went next and started to get interested in his plans.  Maybe I will take or reject my father&#39;s offer earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Most will just follow the heir. Erm... initially I refused my father&#39;s orders to take over the attack on the Russian Don. But I&#39;ve had problems with the Russian Don since the death of my best friend Pasha and Anthony&#39;s disappearance without any news until now. Once I finish  taking revenge, then I will not be tied to the mafia group anymore and start to detach myself from the mafia world.&#34;  Had a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you don&#39;t have to worry that Callum will remain safe in my care. Moreover, I have been equipped with martial arts skills and intelligence. So you don&#39;t have to worry about Callum. It&#39;s just that lately I have often left Callum to do my business. So I hope  You&#39;re ready to accompany Sophie to look after Callum. Moreover, I see that Callum is very close to you and doesn&#39;t want to be far from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause and then Matteo came closer to me after he had been facing away from me while he was talking at length about his world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He approached me and started talking seriously.  Half whispering he leaned closer to my face.  I felt disturbed and turned my face back immediately spontaneously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I hope you don&#39;t need to include feelings in this relationship. We only act as parents. Forget about last night&#39;s incident. Don&#39;t include our personal problems in raising children! Don&#39;t be selfish!&#34;  Pressing his voice as he finished his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed saliva feeling cornered by Matteo.  I feel like I am the one who is most wrong in this matter because it is too subjective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never mind! Let&#39;s get out of here and come back without any problems!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I, who was still frozen, then returned to following Matteo&#39;s directions.  Suddenly there was a commotion outside and I saw several people pointing guns at Matteo&#39;s servant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo looked very surprised as did I.  He immediately responded by attacking one of the men behind him who suddenly appeared.  I ran to the side when a fight broke out between them.  Finally Matteo took out his gun and managed to shoot his opponent in the knee.  Matteo says that he knows the man has been giving information to the Russian Don.  It seems like Matteo now feels tripped up and isn&#39;t taking it all lightly.  This is really dangerous because they have dared to openly come to the house twice this week.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That means Callum&#39;s life will be in serious danger.  I became increasingly worried and started to get anxious about all this.  How will Callum survive being chased by the mafia?  Meanwhile, Matteo is often not at home.  They could kidnap or end Callum&#39;s life.  Or taking Callum hostage as bait for Matteo.  After they found out that Matteo had a child and Callum was Matteo&#39;s son.  I was really overwhelmed by a feeling of uncertain anxiety.  Feeling like everything is getting worse and worse.  I hope I will be able to be Callum&#39;s guard and will start joining my father&#39;s mafia group to be able to look after my son Callum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of course I will be taught self-defense techniques and matters relating to intelligence in overcoming problems in the mafia world.  This must have something to do with Matteo and I must be an insider who infiltrated the mafia group that my father had formed a long time ago.  So that I can get related information regarding the attack on Matteo.  So I can make sure that Callum will be safe.  My mind wandered to my father&#39;s offer earlier and spread to its roots, trying to imagine that I would become part of them and join a large mafia group.  Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted when I heard Matteo&#39;s words to the person who was now in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo tried to bargain for his life very firmly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to lose your life right now?&#34;  Matteo asked the person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t come any closer or I will shoot your friend and destroy him!&#34;  He also threatened others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until they admitted that two other men had done the same thing at Alessio&#39;s house this morning.  When I heard this, I was shocked because it meant that the person who was messing around in my house earlier was the Russian Don&#39;s order too.  But why?  I don&#39;t understand the concept of mafia at all.  What exactly is the Russian Don planning to do to my father?  But why did he match Sillas with his daughter?  I don&#39;t know, I will explore it further after I agree to join the big mafia group formed by my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They then apologized to Matteo but heard one of them cursing softly at him.  This was really confusing and surprised me because now I heard their conversation directly.  I have less respect and no sympathy for Matteo now after hearing their conversation.  Especially when Matteo said that he was the one who gave the information to the Russian Don to infiltrate my house.  This is really very confusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What&#39;s actually behind them?  Now who are friends and foes?  Is my father in grave danger?  So now Sillas is at stake because he will soon be getting married to the Russian Don&#39;s daughter.  So who has the evil role in this affair?   I was very confused.  Have Matteo&#39;s mafia group and the Russian Don mafia group agreed to become allies?  But what about Sillas and Aelita&#39;s wedding later?  Will this be a dangerous scourge for our family or will it actually strengthen the relationship between my father&#39;s mafia group and the Russian Don mafia group?  So I can&#39;t read what&#39;s happening now, it&#39;s really beyond my comprehension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the future I will investigate all this further.  I don&#39;t want any harm to come to my father and Sillas but I still want Matteo and Callum to be safe.  Really in quite a serious dilemma.  However, he will still pretend to be innocent about it.  After coming out of hiding, I will assume that everything is unknown to me and has nothing to do with me, either of the two parties concerned that I am protecting.</p>
