                <p>Matteo&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost lost control and left Lilianna and Callum in great danger.  If only Lilianna hadn&#39;t immediately reminded me.  Maybe we were caught by the two cars flanking my car.  Between the Russian Don car I was chasing and another car behind which I didn&#39;t recognize the driver.  Maybe I would know him if I saw him clearly.  But my view couldn&#39;t penetrate the rather dark windshield of the car.  I think it was Alessio&#39;s order.  Maybe he&#39;s starting to read my movements.  He must have been very suspicious about my plans for his future in-laws.  He apparently became the guardian of the Russian Don.  I really have to be more careful now before I do anything.  Luckily, Lilianna was the alarm that accompanied me.  At least it reminded me of the time I almost did something reckless and careless.  Moreover, I saw that the meter in my car was almost out of fuel.  If I still dare to step on the gas to catch the Russian Don&#39;s car then my fate will be woeful.  Not only me but Lilianna and Callum will also get hit by the stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately followed Lilianna&#39;s realistic directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo turned around!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at that meter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately looked at the meter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes that&#39;s right, fortunately you immediately reminded me, thank you Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you&#39;re welcome, hurry up Matteo!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately swerved using my driving skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally I drove the car quickly after successfully reversing the direction of the car.  It seemed like they were quite surprised to see my sudden action like this.  Maybe they thought I&#39;d keep chasing the Russian Don&#39;s car.  But in fact I just dodged and drove as fast as possible away from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking again, I immediately turned the wheel towards home.  Because the car is almost out of fuel</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worried about breaking down in the middle of the road.  If I fill up on petrol first then I think they will be able to catch up and detect my whereabouts.  For this reason, I immediately took Lilianna and Callum away from their car and continued the journey to my house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until we arrived at my house safely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luckily you reminded me, Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I was just spontaneous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I think being at home is better for you and Callum, stay in your room until I get back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Matteo where are you going again?&#34;  Lilianna&#39;s voice was half shouting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A moment!&#34;  I didn&#39;t answer her question and walked very hastily, leaving her holding Callum who was still asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw her still frozen there downstairs and stared at her until I actually left the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately rushed to the garage to use my other car.  Drive very quickly and without hesitation.  Until in the middle of the road I called one of my subordinates who often acts as my driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you? Come here quickly! I&#39;ll share the lock later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately hung up the phone and it didn&#39;t take long for him to arrive in the car he was driving.  I immediately parked my car and left it at the repair shop for it to be serviced.  Then I got into the car driven by my driver who I just called some time ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where to?&#34;  He asked, half turning towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Typical, go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Mr Matteo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carries out his duties according to my instructions and doesn&#39;t feel confused anymore because he is used to doing it with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly we were ambushed by a group of unknown mafia.  It seems like they were ordered to deliberately trip me up.  I immediately told my Van driver to keep driving the car.  The car was driving recklessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, keep going, don&#39;t slack off!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a chase between the car I was riding in and the car that had blocked this car.  Not only that, several people in the car kept shooting at this car.  The gunshots sounded very loud and loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang bang bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without pause, it continued to sound and aimed at this car but repeatedly didn&#39;t hit it.  Until finally my driver was shot and the van accidentally hit the wall of a building.  I started to feel tense and panicked.  Don&#39;t know what to do after the car suddenly stops because the van is dying.  It turned out that the shot was aimed directly at the location of his heart, right in his left chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I see that my driver has immediately died.  I&#39;m not stopping here and trying to get out of this car straight away.  Before finally they actually met me in this car.  The speed of the car chasing us was a bit slow apparently.  So I managed to get out of the car before I saw them here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly the idea arose to quickly sneak between the buildings and pass by a building that we had crashed into.  As for the car and the body of my driver, I will leave it in this place for now.  Because there wasn&#39;t enough time to evacuate it.  Before they were actually here.  For that reason, I only had time to escape and protect myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But unfortunately they saw me passing between the buildings and started to get out of their car to go through the narrow streets.  They chased me at an unstoppable running speed.  I increase my strength to continue running without stopping.  They kept chasing me and made me almost run out of breath.  My breath was labored and I kept walking without stopping.  Don&#39;t let me stop and be silent.  Because if I stop for a moment they will easily ambush me.  It could even finish me off without mercy.  Maybe they won&#39;t let me breathe a sigh of relief first, even for a moment.  For this reason, I did not relax my energy even though my ankles definitely felt sore and weak.  But complaining and despairing will only lead me to the death they hope for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They continued to direct fire at me.  Although several times it always misses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch it!&#34;  One of them shouted at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang bang bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t shrink my guts one bit.  No matter how many people chase me.  He didn&#39;t even feel afraid even though he was continuously bombarded by gunfire.  I still maintain my own destiny to continue living in the way I have now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until I started to feel tired and took out my gun from under the jacket I was wearing.  Try to defend yourself by occasionally countering their shots.  I started directing shots at them even though I was still running away from their position who were still chasing me while firing shot after shot.</p>
