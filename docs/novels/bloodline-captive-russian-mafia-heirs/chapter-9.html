                <p>Matteo&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked towards Anthony and Louis after finishing my business saying goodbye to Lilianna, Shopie and checking on my child&#39;s condition for the last time today.  Because I will spend several days with them, especially I will really miss my child.  So the sun on the forehead is a release for longing that never existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I&#39;m in front of Anthony and Louis.  Immediately took them to the basement and made sure everything was safe in my house.  I took him to a closed room in one of the rooms in my house.  A mysterious room that no one is allowed to enter.  I opened the slot by turning it after entering the room.  The cupboard finally moved and opened the way for us to go downstairs.  There are stairs here and we went down these stairs one by one.  Until finally we arrived at the bankers which was safe enough for us to discuss here discussing the strategy that we would announce to our group who were ready to help on the front line.  In the core group there are only three of us who always make plans and work around it while the others help in the execution process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what kind of strategy will you share with us, Matteo?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, later I will infiltrate the building and be an invited guest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you get in? To be able to enter the invitation, there must be an invitation card or barcode that must be shown. Moreover, in the class of Russian Don Vlad Petrov, he must have prepared a sophisticated invitation concept and have a tightly guarded security system.&#34;  Anthony protested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That can be arranged, I&#39;ve studied everything before I broke the news to you two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, next?&#34;  Louis asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next, you and Anthony will stand guard outside and bring in the troops in code after I succeed in shooting the groom or Sillas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, are you going to finish off Alessio&#39;s kid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, not only Sillas but there are also those I am targeting to kill. Because my concept is to make the Russian Don&#39;s daughter crazy so that there is no heir. Because Vlad Petrov&#39;s only child is Aelita Petrov after the death of his first child, Jeremy Petrov, three years ago.  &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, let&#39;s set up the formation immediately!&#34;  Bring Anthony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We immediately created an attack formation scheme to make it more structured and focused.  So that our mission can be easily and smoothly successful and produce results according to our hopes and desires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, my two friends and I immediately went to the casino to meet other mafias from our group who were ready for this attack mission.  Previously I trusted Louis to arrange a meeting schedule and invited everyone to come today to the casino.  When we arrived at the casino we explained what the three of us had arranged at my house.  Everyone understands and it takes days for us to be in the casino and at the same time practicing like a dress rehearsal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing a mission to meet between my group at the casino for an attack later on the Russian Don&#39;s daughter&#39;s wedding, I returned home and met Liliana, Shopie and Callum.  Thankfully they are awake and fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got home I was immediately greeted warmly by my little family.  Huh, small family?  No!  Not yet, I mean, I only have children biologically but are not yet sacredly bound by the bonds of marriage which are often carried out at the altar with the priest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After having time to chat in the family room and playing around in the garden accompanying Callum who wanted to play on the swings, suddenly Lilianna said goodbye to go home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Liliana, what&#39;s wrong? Say it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I have to go home after being here for a while. Because my father could find out where I am, who suddenly disappeared without any news since I came here. I&#39;m worried that my father suspects me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I can&#39;t stop you from staying here, Lilianna. Although it looks like Callum will feel very disappointed when you&#39;re not around. He will ask me and Shopie about your whereabouts later. But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll try to handle everything. Leave Callum to me,  as long as you don&#39;t get in trouble with your father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for understanding Matteo, even though it&#39;s really hard to leave Callum, I&#39;m afraid that if I take Callum home with me there will be big problems. I&#39;m worried that Dad will mess with Callum or that I&#39;ll lose Callum again for a long time.  even forever. I don&#39;t want that to happen.&#34;  I explain according to the deepest content of my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I thought about that too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay Matteo, I&#39;ll go home straight away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, let me take you to the garage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked with Lilianna to the garage where she kept the car she used to get here a few days ago.  Meanwhile, Callum is still playing in the park accompanied by Sophie.  I deliberately didn&#39;t bring Lilianna with me because I was worried that Callum would cry when his mother&#39;s car drove away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got to the front of Lilianna&#39;s car, I saw that the rear tire was flat and I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna, it looks like the back tire of your car is flat. It looks like it was hit by a nail, I think for sure the inner tire was also punctured.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where?&#34;  Looked at the rear tires of her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, you&#39;re right, Matteo. So what should I do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Em, it&#39;s best to keep your car here for now. I&#39;ll take it to the repair shop later to change the tires.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then how do I get home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just let me take you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it troublesome?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, just relax.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then, thank you in advance Matteo for agreeing to take me home. Since it&#39;s a blackout and there&#39;s no cell phone signal, I can&#39;t order a taxi online. So I&#39;ll take your offer so I can go home now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34;  I took Lilianna to my car and we got into it then I drove the car after I started the engine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car was driving casually and suddenly in the middle of the road someone was stalking my car and blocked the car we were traveling in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unlucky.&#34;  My hands hit the steering wheel quite hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilianna just looked at me with an unusual expression and started to feel uneasy when the person blocking the car forced us out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, get out! Otherwise we will burn your car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was actually just worried about Lilianna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;God damn it.&#34;  I said spontaneously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Lilianna, you wait in the car and hide so that they don&#39;t see and find you. You just lock the key from the inside so that it&#39;s safe in this car, no one can get in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But,  Matteo...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it, just do it!&#34;</p>
