                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before we finally decided to return to Russia.  I have plans to buy souvenirs from Italy first.  Next, I want to buy Callum some cute clothes for him to wear.  Since meeting the technician, we are now under tight security.  Because he was worried that something bad would happen, especially to Matteo, who was thought to be the new Don.  Even though Matteo was only disguising himself, he said he agreed to the technician&#39;s question.  So wherever we go, escorts will be carried out to prevent anything bad from happening to their Don.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So the car we were traveling in was clearly guarded by guard cars behind and on the left and right.  Matteo&#39;s people are now numerous and increasing.  In fact, I didn&#39;t know what Matteo was planning before meeting the technician.  I couldn&#39;t read the pattern that Matteo laid out.  It&#39;s really very complicated to put together and I can&#39;t interpret the series after series that Matteo has done, especially those that are still a plan in his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I&#39;m talking with Matteo about our next life.  In the car there were only me, Matteo, Callum and the online taxi driver in front who was focused on driving.  I don&#39;t think the driver will understand our conversation.  So I was free to chat with Matteo.  Apart from not only not understanding, the driver also has no important role in this problem.  Because he was just a passing person who would soon be gone after completing his task of taking us to where we were going.  For this reason, I am more open in my conversations with Matteo.  Moreover, Callum is still small and doesn&#39;t understand what we are talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo, I&#39;m worried about Callum&#39;s safety right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to worry too much, maybe it&#39;s normal for a mother to worry about her child. But don&#39;t worry too much so you don&#39;t feel like all this has become a very heavy burden in your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, it&#39;s very difficult, still. Everything happens automatically Matteo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I understand what you think and feel. But... Em.. what if you just live with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, with you guys? With you at your house, what do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why? Why do I have to stay at your house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that you can still be with Callum. So you are able to control and make sure things are fine. That is if you want and are willing. If you mind or don&#39;t want to, that&#39;s okay, it&#39;s not a problem for me. I&#39;m just suggesting and offering this opportunity  to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um... that&#39;s fine, I will try to lobby my father and design a scenario so that my father will allow me to live outside the house for quite a long time. Without any further questions that corner me. I clearly want to live and live with Callum. But if I have to take him home  in my house it&#39;s impossible and it&#39;s hard. I don&#39;t want dad to do anything bad to Callum. So I trust Callum to stay with you at your house. He&#39;ll probably be safe with you, but I&#39;m afraid that at any time you&#39;ll be careless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, there is a problem there, so I hope you will join in with Sophie to look after and look after Callum at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;ll do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking much, I immediately said yes and agreed to the offer that Matteo made to me.  Maybe in the next few days after arriving in Moscow I will immediately take some of my personal belongings home to transfer them to Matteo&#39;s house.  So that I don&#39;t have to commute or go back and forth to the house to bring the things I need.  Especially clothes, I will bring my clothes to copy while staying at Matteo&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes Lilianna, don&#39;t you have anything else to do after this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean don&#39;t you want to visit other places in Italy first before we go back to Russia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um... where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, think about it before we finally go home and you feel sorry because you missed something important and want to repeat it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um... I think I want to buy some souvenirs to take with me to Russia. I also want to buy Callum clothes that he can wear as a souvenir that he went to Italy when he was two years old with me and you, Matteo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s good, then do you need guarding to go to the shopping center?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um are you going alone or are you taking Callum?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s better for Callum to come with me so that when he sees clothes that I think are interesting he can immediately try them on in the changing room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, do I need to come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it&#39;s good for you to come along so that someone can look after us and be a shield while we&#39;re outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready, I will look after you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo immediately directed the driver to go to the shopping center before we finally went to the airport to fly to Russia.  The driver carried out his duties well and took us to a large shopping center in Italy.  So we don&#39;t have any trouble finding the right and interesting souvenirs to take home to Russia later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve arrived, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes, thank you, the fare has been entered into your virtual account.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m ready, thank you again sir. I hope you have a pleasant and memorable trip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo and I smiled and without much ado unloaded the two suitcases we brought containing our equipment while in Italy.  Meanwhile I carried Callum while Matteo carried the suitcase.  We look like a complete family by dividing the tasks within it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walked towards the entrance of the shopping center and was accompanied by several people who surrounded us on both sides and behind.  We are like important people who are closely guarded by bodyguards.  Along the way, in the middle of a busy shopping center, we became the center of attention of many people&#39;s eyes looking at us.  I&#39;m quite uncomfortable with all this.  Feeling disturbed by their presence following us all this time.  Until I started to feel uncomfortable and whispered softly to Matteo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Lilianna, what are you whispering about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will they still follow us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah it seems so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel uncomfortable and uncomfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm, same.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can we avoid them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who knows.&#34;</p>
