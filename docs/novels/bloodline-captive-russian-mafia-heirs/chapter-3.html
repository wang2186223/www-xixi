                <p>Matteo&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today the sky looks cloudy, thick black clouds cover the Moscow sky.  Fog was everywhere and now my vision looked terrible.  I feel like tonight has been a very messy night for me.  After I experienced bad and very bad problems.  I decided to visit a bar to just have a drink and get rid of the chaos that was still residing in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first time I just received a tough assignment from my own father.  The task of carrying out the covert business that father had planned for me as far as possible.  My father always wanted me to be his successor in managing the business he had been running for a long time.  My father, Enzo Costello, was an oil mafia and drug mafia in the Soviet Union who was part of the red mafia. He is close friends with La Cosa Nostra from Italy or the Italian mafia.  The mafia&#39;s name is Alessio, who has lived in Russia for a long time and lives with his family here.  They developed a plan to destroy the biggest mafia in Russia, namely Vlad Petrov.  My father trusted me to be a spy so that I could find out Vlad&#39;s business secrets so that his business could be destroyed easily.  At first I refused my father&#39;s request, which seemed very pushy.  But I couldn&#39;t help but follow my father&#39;s rules after being threatened for a very complicated matter for me.  There was a dilemma but I admitted defeat to my father and started being a spy.  However, because I lacked intelligence skills, I finally asked my best friend to come with me in this matter.  He is willing and he is quite experienced.  However, the big mafia certainly had more serious experiences so my friends and I were caught.  In fact, we were held hostage for some time.  But luckily I managed to escape from their clutches.  However, my best friend, Pasha, died at the hands of Vlad Petrov&#39;s favorite and trusted subordinate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, confess, whose orders were you?&#34;  My feet were trampled by thick and hard shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile my friend was being whipped with a buckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, confess! Otherwise you&#39;ll die right here right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! I won&#39;t say it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh how dare you, feel this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We continued to be tortured in a dark room where there was little light.  Instantly Pasha, who was half prostrate, was able to pull the leg of one of those carrying a gun.  I was no less quick and immediately blocked and grabbed the other gun.  Until there was an attack with a gun and gunshot after shot was heard loudly in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, you&#39;re brave, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One bullet missed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only did we shoot each other, we also had quite fierce physical fights.  The martial arts action is quite interesting and triggers even higher adrenaline.  Until my best friend Pasha lost control and started to lose his balance.  He finally fell down and a gun was pointed at his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t do anything right now other than waiting for a miracle that Pasha will be able to pull off a stunning action like he did earlier.  But Pasha instead told me to run and leave him here alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Run guys! Let&#39;s run Matteo!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, Pasha even accidentally said my name.  Then my identity will be easy to trace later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just forget about me! Come on, save yourself now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first I was hesitant but after a while because Pasha kept telling me to run, I had no other choice but to leave him here alone.  Because when Pasha spoke like that, it meant he had run out of methods and was starting to feel hopeless and then no longer had any hope that would make us both safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I took a step I heard and saw shot after shot aimed at Pasha&#39;s body, even from top to bottom.  Until Pasha really looked pathetic and could no longer be helped.  He was forcibly dragged away until I didn&#39;t find his body properly treated.  Meanwhile, I, who had been intimidated, continued to run and get away, even though of course the bullets continued to chase my steps.  But I managed to avoid it and was finally able to escape and be free from the punishment room.  I can be free from Vlad&#39;s environment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even so, I went home empty-handed.  Instead I went home with a huge sense of guilt.  At the same time I didn&#39;t know what to explain to my father.  Moreover, Pasha had mentioned my name earlier.  It is very clear that my name will be data for finding facts.  They&#39;ll look into it and maybe now they&#39;ve got the fact that I&#39;m Enzo Costello&#39;s son.  It could be that now, quickly and nimbly, a group ordered by Vlad Petrov has attacked my father.  So I can&#39;t afford to go home now.  The chaos will make me feel even more cornered and cornered.  I can&#39;t take responsibility for that yet.  Because I don&#39;t have any expertise in this matter.  For me, this is something new and this is my first experience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d rather go into a bar and sip a few drinks very lightly.  I wanted to forget this dark day and escape for a moment from the fact that my father would be very angry with me because Vlad would definitely make a calculation with him.  I can&#39;t escape all of this.  Unless it takes away my consciousness tonight to feel safe and comfortable at least for just one night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Add more!&#34;  I called the bartender to refill my glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t there many, sir? You have drunk almost twenty-one glasses of this beer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crazy!  I don&#39;t care at all how much I sip of this intoxicating drink.  Besides, I have plenty of money to pay for it.  I had already withdrawn the contents of my ATM and credit card before my father blocked them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you refusing my request?&#34;  With a stoned expression and droopy eyes, the bartender seemed afraid that he would reject me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still felt semi-conscious even though I had drunk a lot of drinks.  But I still insist on losing my consciousness completely tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough, sir! You could die before long.&#34;  The bartender refused the twenty-second glass.</p>
