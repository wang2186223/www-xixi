                <p>Matteo&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After three years had passed, I finally received news via telephone about Lilianna, who had been a part of my life since that night.  In fact, the thing that really surprised me was that someone who was my flesh and blood was now with me and was being looked after by my maternal cousin, Sophie.  I was surprised that what I said was true when I last met Lilianna in the parking lot at the bar after we made love that night.  It could be that Lilianna is my soul mate which has been delayed.  But how can all that come true?  Even though I have a future wife who has been my fiancé for the past four years.  She is Massima Adelina, a beautiful woman of Italian blood.  Even though my father actually didn&#39;t agree with me being with her, this time she couldn&#39;t prevent it or oppose my decision to ask for her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This morning I got a surprising phone call from someone I haven&#39;t seen for a long time.  A new number suddenly entered my contacts several times and didn&#39;t have time to pick up because I had just arrived home after taking my child and Sophie out to buy something daily necessities for Callum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone rang again when I arrived at my room and took off the jacket I was wearing.  I immediately picked it up and without missing a beat.  Because I think people who call more than once have quite serious interests.  So I had to immediately give him the opportunity to convey that valuable message to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello? Sorry, who is this with? I didn&#39;t answer your call earlier because I was driving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard no sound and only silence greeted my eardrums.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello? Is anyone there?&#34;  I greeted her again to make sure that the call had not been disconnected and that she was not the perpetrator of a wrong number or just a prankster who wanted to play a trick on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;May I know who you are? What do you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this with Matteo Bogdan Castello?&#34;  She said my name very completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah right, who are you?&#34;  I feel like I know her distinctive voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly Sophie came with Callum and asked me to do something for my son because she was having difficulty doing it.  I fulfilled her request, after that she left when I asked her to leave me because I was having business with the person who was calling me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello? Matteo? Are you still there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, my son and his nanny came to ask me to do something that was causing him a bit of trouble. Can you repeat what your name was? I didn&#39;t really hear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was silent because I remembered that familiar name.  Suddenly I was surprised because she was an important person in my life in the past.  In fact, I lived in curiosity all this time after doing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you the woman who three years ago slept with me after getting drunk at the bar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah right, I&#39;m that girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to tell me something I don&#39;t know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I want to ask you something important regarding my future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? What is that? Say it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is my child with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, your son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, my son Callum, is he with you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shocked beyond words, I tried to confirm again by continuing to ask the truth of this reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Callum also my son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;ve had him since we played at the bar that time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I&#39;m serious, Matteo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A big thing that I didn&#39;t expect at all.  Even though I adopted Callum a year ago, when I saw him being picked up by a woman named Beatrice.  I felt sorry and somehow my inner self was interested in buying and penetrating Callum at that moment.   It turns out that there is indeed a strong emotional bond between the child and the biological father.  There is an energy of mutual attraction.  Until finally Lilianna contacted me for the first time since the incident took place.  It was only in this third year that I found his voice on the telephone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we meet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, I want to meet Callum, my son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, come here and tell me everything that happened! OK, I&#39;ll send you my complete address via text message so you can easily track it and get here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;ve received the text message. I&#39;ll go to your house right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone was hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some time after the phone was hung up and I was waiting for her arrival, now she arrived at my house. I deliberately ordered all my servants to be friendly and welcome her with joy.  Because she is the mother of my child.  I carried Callum and when Lilianna stood in front of me I felt that she was still the same beautiful as before and had not changed, still looking youthful after three years had passed and she had been pregnant and given birth to a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I see correctly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m Lilianna, Callum&#39;s mother. Come here, son!&#34;  While opening her arms wide and bowing to welcome Callum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though they have been separated for a year and are still very small, Callum still remembers the figure of his mother.  He responded to his mother&#39;s welcome by hugging his mother tightly and then Lilianna got up and took my child in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum was so comfortable in his mother&#39;s arms.  Until he fell asleep.  I also told him to put my child to sleep in his room while accompanied by his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile I picked up the telephone that my servant had given me.  It turned out to be an important call from my colleagues Anthony and Louis.  Since the incident, my father gave me a second assignment after I failed in the first assignment until I lost my best friend Pasha, now I have started to enter into the dark business that my father Enzo has also been involved in for a long time.  I was part of it and was announced as the next mafia boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing talking with my colleague, I hung up the phone and started going into the room to meet my son and his mother.  I had time to talk to Lilianna about the conflicts that occurred in our respective lives from the moment the incident started until Callum was finally separated from his mother and is now in my hands as his biological father.  It turns out that Lilianna hasn&#39;t married yet even though she already has a child from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knock knock knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, there are Mr. Anthony and Mr. Louis.&#34;</p>
