                <p>Matteo&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still no answer was heard, only the sound of gunshots that never stopped.  Maybe his phone was far away or maybe Anthony... No!  I have to catch up with Anthony as soon as possible before the worst thing happens to him today, namely a ridiculous and tragic death.  It would be truly unfortunate and pathetic if this really happened.  So I have to immediately save Anthony right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately rushed over to Lilianna and Callum to say goodbye.  But first, I will first check Anthony&#39;s current location using my IT knowledge.  Because I learned this long before I joined my father&#39;s group and became part of the mafia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing tracking Anthony&#39;s current whereabouts and having definitely found his current position.  So I immediately said goodbye to Lilianna to go out and called Shopie to accompany Lilianna in looking after Callum at home.  But Sophie refused this time because she said she had important matters.  But I didn&#39;t think much about it and just left the house to immediately meet Anthony, who now seemed to be in serious danger.  I don&#39;t have much time to think about anything, especially about Sophie&#39;s affairs.  Although in fact I feel worried if I have to leave Lilianna and Callum alone in this house.  Although of course they were accompanied by several servants and a gardener and even a housekeeper.  But I still feel worried.  But there was nothing else they could do other than immediately go to make sure Anthony survived the day.  At least I will try my best so that nothing serious happens to Anthony out there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately went to my car and drove myself.  I didn&#39;t have much time to slow down so I stepped on the gas at a speed that exceeded normal limits.  I drove fast to quickly get to where I was going.  This is a matter of Anthony&#39;s life which I must immediately ensure is safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally I arrived at the place I found on the GPS.  I saw Anthony&#39;s car parked in the middle of the road and both of his car doors were just open.  I immediately got out of my car.  Then walked towards Anthony&#39;s car.  I saw all around there were bodies of unknown people.  Meanwhile I didn&#39;t see Anthony here or around here.  There was only blood dripping and smeared around the car and even inside the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped on something and immediately looked down where I felt like I had accidentally stepped on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh Anthony&#39;s cell phone.&#34;  I muttered to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went back to looking for Anthony around here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anthony... Anthony... Where are you?&#34;  Half-screaming Anthony&#39;s name, maybe suddenly he would just appear in front of me, even though it was impossible to determine whether Anthony was in good condition or vice versa.  But I hope he can survive and escape from this situation that once threatened him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called his name many times.  Until my sweat dripped and my stomach still felt hungry, the sound could not be suppressed.  Because I only ate two bites earlier.  But the most important thing is that I still have the energy if I have to fight today.  Suddenly a telephone ringtone came from my cell phone which vibrated in my trouser pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced right and left and front and back in case something bad threatened me as I picked up the phone and focused on my cell phone.  I have to stay alert even though I&#39;m surrounded by corpses that can no longer move.  After everything I made sure it was safe.  I immediately took my cell phone and looked at my cell phone monitor screen.  It turned out the call was from Lilianna.  Hmm... What&#39;s wrong with him calling me?  Was Callum looking for me and crying to see me?  I immediately picked up the phone without further ado because I was worried that he would convey something important that he wanted to tell me.  Or maybe Lilianna will tell me to go home immediately because maybe she has to go home and her father tells her to go home immediately.  I immediately clicked on my cell phone screen to answer Lilianna&#39;s call without thinking anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo... Matteo...&#34; His voice sounded like someone who was very panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang bang bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of gunshots was heard behind my phone.  I immediately widened my eyes and felt shocked, especially after hearing Lilianna&#39;s voice calling my name very frantically.  Not to mention the constant sound of gunshots echoing.  It seems like the gunshots were not far from where my house is or could it be that they happened inside my house?  I was suddenly shocked and immediately asked what really happened to Lilianna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34;  I panicked again after panicking earlier because I got a call from Anthony, who I thought was in danger because there were gunshots on the phone.  It&#39;s true that something bad has happened to Anthony.  I took Anthony&#39;s cell phone and put it in my coat pocket to take home so that the data could be hacked by someone who might find the cellphone if I left this cell phone lying here like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilianna didn&#39;t answer my question and the phone was disconnected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately remembered Callum.  I&#39;m afraid Callum will do something wrong and even get shot.  It seemed like they were the same group of people who did all this mess to Anthony.  I think they&#39;re after me.  But how do they know the address and location of my house?  Not right!  I immediately ran to my car and without further ado started the car engine and drove at high speed.  My mind was confused during the trip.  I only remember Callum and Lilianna.  But hopefully the house guards can ward them off.  But I&#39;m worried that the home guards will lose because they will definitely use weapons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived in front of the house I saw a terrible mess.  At the gate of the house there was the body of the house guard lying.  I immediately went inside and beat up the people who dared to disturb my house.  I dragged some of them out of the house and beat them until they were black and blue.  Some of them died in my hands because I shot them and some of them ran out of the house somewhere.  Obviously I care about Callum&#39;s condition now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Callum?&#34;  When everything was finished Lilianna came over to me very surprised.  I asked him about Callum&#39;s whereabouts.  Because he was worried that something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilianna didn&#39;t answer me and immediately went upstairs in surprise.  I was shocked, maybe something bad had happened to Callum.  But suddenly Lilianna picked up Callum who was sleeping and walked towards me after going down the stairs.  Without further ado, I immediately hugged Callum tightly and hugged him with great warmth.  Honestly, I don&#39;t want anything bad to happen to Callum and Lilianna.  I&#39;m afraid that Callum will become the target of cruelty by those who have bad intentions towards me and my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Em... it looks like this was planned beforehand.  I suspect that our attack plan has been leaked and known or overheard by the opposing party.</p>
