                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo&#39;s answer was really annoying.  I&#39;m used to being guarded because my father is also a mafia boss.  So everywhere there is guard.  But this time I felt very disturbed because this was my small family event.  I just want there to be me, my son Callum and his father.  Don&#39;t want anyone else to come between us.  Because it made me really uncomfortable and felt like I wasn&#39;t free to do anything.  It feels like freedom is being thwarted and it doesn&#39;t make you feel happy when traveling like this.  We should have been happy but instead this was ruined by their arrival who unexpectedly would disrupt our holiday like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you guys be a bit distant from us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing my unusual and uncomfortable expression, Matteo immediately became sensitive.  Even though he was sensitive for a while, in the end he voiced what was in my heart too.  Finally, some of them moved away and just watched from a distance.  Even so, I still felt uncomfortable, just not like before, where I really felt stiff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callum and I immediately chose clothes that we thought were appropriate.  Asked Matteo for a comment on what would suit Callum.  Matteo also responded to some of the clothes we had chosen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo, is this suitable for Callum?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if someone thought he had his index finger on his chin, his other arms were kept at his chest in a folded position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;May also.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Correct?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about this one?&#34;  I showed the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umm, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s suitable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah seriously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing choosing some clothes that I felt were suitable for Callum, I started inviting Callum to wear them in the changing room to make sure that they really fit and were right for him to wear.  After trying everything, I immediately paid for it at the cashier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then we continued to visit the place where we would buy souvenirs.  We also found some interesting and unique souvenirs.  Bring it to the shopping cart and redeem it at the cashier&#39;s desk.  Then went back out of the shopping center by riding in one of the guard&#39;s cars.  Because they allowed us to ride in their car instead of having to rent an online taxi again, it would take quite a long time to get to the airport.  Because we were pressed for time to get there before the scheduled flight arrived, we had to be there immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the journey, nothing worrying or bad happened.  We safely arrived at the airport and then the people accompanying us said goodbye to return to their basecamp.  Because they were only assigned to be technicians to escort us to the airport.  Matteo and I felt relieved after they left.  I thought that they would mess up but they didn&#39;t.  In fact, we are really looked after like their real bosses.  I really felt nervous before because I was suspicious that they would do something bad to us on the road.  But now I feel sorry for suspecting them like that.  It turns out they are good and not as bad as I thought about them earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We arrived at the airport early, a few minutes before the scheduled departure.  When the time came for the flight to arrive, we immediately rushed into the plane and occupied the seats according to the provisions we had obtained from the tickets we had ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our holiday in Italy is now over and we will soon arrive in Russia to return to living our days as usual.  I also tried to find ideas to explain to my father later.  Regarding the reason why I will stay at Matteo&#39;s house.  Don&#39;t let father know what really happened.  Moreover, he knows about Callum&#39;s whereabouts.  If that happens it will be very messy.  I can&#39;t imagine the bad things and possibilities that will happen later.  My father was a reckless person.  Even small children are no exception.  He is a fierce and heartless mafia boss.  I don&#39;t want anything to happen to Callum.  So I had to think carefully about reasons that really fit my father&#39;s logic and he could just believe.  Without asking further about my reasons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While on the plane, after the plane started to fly I could only sleep in silence while staring at the view behind the window.  Meanwhile Callum was fast asleep and leaned against my body.  Likewise with Matteo, he also fell asleep as if he was very tired and maybe the plane was the safest place for him to get a full rest.  Before he was on land and everything felt more threatened.  He definitely feels uneasy and disturbed when he is on land.  So he took advantage of this time to sleep soundly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could only look at Callum and Matteo who were both asleep.  I imagine a bright and beautiful future from behind their innocent faces while sleeping.  I imagine there will be experiences that I never believed could happen.  Where Matteo and I got married and lived together with Callum in one house as a harmonious family.  The whole house is heaven for us and we are far from anything related to the mafia world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel like this mafia world is a thorn in the way of our happiness.  Because forever our lives will be plagued by feelings of discomfort and haste in living life.  Because wherever we are, we will still be hunted.  I thought that the mafia world was a world where we would make lots of enemies and have bad luck in life.  But we can&#39;t just stop this business.  It is very difficult to break it because it is in the form of a strong chain.  But I think one day everything will be finished and over.  Although the possibility is very small.  Because the mafia world seeks victims from the roots for the mission of becoming a global capital.  But I don&#39;t see that in Matteo.  I found no ambition in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seems like Matteo is just trapped in the bonds of his father&#39;s mafia group, just like I was also trapped by my father&#39;s mafia group.  But I want to make sure that Callum will not have anything to do with any mafia group.  Both from my side and Matteo&#39;s side.  I want Callum&#39;s life in the future to be clean without being haunted by the mafia world.  I want my child to experience a normal life like other humans in general.  However, business doesn&#39;t have to be in a vicious circle like the one experienced by his two grandfathers.  Hoping that my dreams of Callum&#39;s peaceful future come true.  Until finally my daydreams brought me to the land of Russia.  The plane had landed and I immediately woke Matteo.  But I didn&#39;t dare wake Callum and I just carried him out of the plane.</p>
