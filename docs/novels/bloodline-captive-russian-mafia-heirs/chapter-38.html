                <p>I immediately turned to Matteo.  Matteo smiled like he had done something I never instructed him to do.  Killed the two people who had rejected me behind my back.  After saying the names of the two people, I remembered which person it was.  I immediately felt that Matteo had eliminated those two damn people in my group so as not to cause further chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, immediately take care of the funeral process and I&#39;ll be there as soon as my business is finished!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay miss, we are waiting for you to arrive at the funeral later!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the call ended, I chatted with Matteo for a moment before looking back at the data that I had brought in the suitcase that I was carrying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahaha... you&#39;ve got the answer now, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did it, Matteo?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;According to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why? Why did you do it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo smiled again without answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo, do you have to move that fast? I haven&#39;t even had time to think in that direction. But you executed it straight away without any negotiation.&#34;  I continued to be quite amazed at Matteo&#39;s super fast way of working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to wait too long to eliminate losers and rebels. Because letting them live any longer will only invite many disasters to come into our lives. It&#39;s better to eliminate them immediately so that they don&#39;t become sharp thorns in the group you are starting to join.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned, finding it hard to decipher everything.  But he could actually think that fast.  His thinking and movement are very automatic without needing to think long.  Even though it&#39;s naive, it could be the solution I&#39;m currently looking for.  Before he finally heard the story about the problem I had just experienced.  The story I tell from my own mouth.  He was able to understand it long before I told Matteo everything.  Really great and he was able to be a shield for me.  I really need Matteo to accompany me in my life.  So that I don&#39;t become stiff in entering the world of the mafia which is difficult for my normal mind to digest.  I would be really overwhelmed if I had to lead it myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course there had to be Matteo&#39;s intervention as someone experienced in the mafia world for me to be able to lead well and smoothly.  Looks like I have to make Matteo a legitimate part of my life.  So that he can accompany me in completing every mission that will be pursued and targeted.  If I&#39;m alone I feel inadequate and not sure everything will always run smoothly.  In fact, there are many unexpected things that happen in just one group.  Not to mention other groups who are friends, enemies or groups that are just getting to know each other.  It&#39;s really all difficult to guess and predict.  But Matteo was used to reading situations accurately and efficiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately opened the manilla file.  Looked down and opened the suitcase that I carried everywhere today.  Because he had just held a gathering as authentic evidence and lubricant in conveying ideas in front of the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because if I came empty-handed earlier at the gathering.  I will feel less confident in speaking and it will make it difficult for me to convey related messages.  Because everything must be based on facts and data.  So that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was able to speak fluently without the slightest obstacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To find out more about my father&#39;s business, of course I have to open this file.  Opened it sheet by sheet in front of Matteo.  Matteo was also interested in reading it.  I tried to examine and examine the statements in each of these files one by one to better understand what was in them.  Both what is known and what is not generally known about your late father&#39;s mafia group.  I immediately studied it to be able to tinker with the machines and frameworks in the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After reading it little by little, I understood it and immediately studied it.  I didn&#39;t waste my time asking Matteo about many things related to what I was reading.  To gain enlightenment that I don&#39;t yet understand the meaning and purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay Matteo, thank you for giving me many valuable instructions and lessons regarding the problems of the mafia world. Thank you also for protecting me from evil hands that could threaten my safety in the future. If you hadn&#39;t taken the role earlier then  I would be very confused and could become a target of terror from those irresponsible and greedy hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, no problem, Lilianna, don&#39;t be shy about me. I will always be number one and be the front guard for you. If that&#39;s not the case, then I&#39;m really worried that your safety will be threatened. So be careful because there are many petty people who are in the mafia group environment.  Of course, many of them don&#39;t have a sincere heart. Because the priority is to seek as much material as possible and put aside their conscience. For this reason, the main mission in this mafia business is to become superior and a top class capitalist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I can understand what you mean. That almost everyone is fighting for power and seats even though their groups are attacking each other and there is chaos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s true, so stay alert. Keep your stock of trust close and don&#39;t sell it and sell it at a cheap price. This is also for your good in the future. So that you don&#39;t be careless in giving trust to other people. Because in fact, your father&#39;s trusted people clearly don&#39;t like you.  Your position and position. That means they also have the same intentions towards your late father and your older brother, Sillas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, that&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can only understand and realize all this.  Through this incident, the bad side and character of my group was revealed.  Matteo is really sophisticated in thinking and analyzing situations.  He can even read a person&#39;s personality and intentions towards someone.  He really learned from his own experience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t think I have long to stay with Matteo today.  Because there is still a lot of new work that I have to take care of.  Moreover, completing old work that had been neglected due to the sudden deaths of his father and Sillas.  I have a lot of work that I have to finish immediately and get to the bottom of until I can really breathe a little easier.  Not like now, I don&#39;t feel so calm in living this life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo insisted he would be by my side and he wanted to see how some of the meetings went.   And Matteo gave me ways on how I should treat the people in my group to gain their respect.   So he would take part in the morning meeting the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Matteo, I&#39;ll just say goodbye.  Because I don&#39;t have to miss it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately said goodbye to Matteo.</p>
