                <p>Matteo&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This morning, Lilianna came to my house early because she said she missed Callum and wanted to meet him immediately because her mind kept racing to come to my house immediately.  Even though just yesterday afternoon I took her home to her house even though she didn&#39;t arrive home and only asked me to drop her off at the flyover which is not far from where her house is.  But just one night she lost Callum and Lilianna was gone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t wait to hug my son again and accompany him to play all day.  Even though he had been with Callum for days and even spent the night here.  But maybe that wasn&#39;t enough to cure her longing for the past year since she lost Callum because his son, Callum, had been hidden and kidnapped and then thrown away and sold for a cheap price.  Luckily, the person who bought it happened to be me, his biological father.  So Callum is still safe with me now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A phone call from Lilianna&#39;s contact.  I picked it up and answered immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, what&#39;s wrong, Lilianna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Callum home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, where do you think your Callum is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, that&#39;s good, you don&#39;t have any plans to go out? Is there Sophie at home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Geez, can you ask one by one? I&#39;m overwhelmed and confused about answering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahaha, I&#39;m sorry, um... okay then, can I go to your house today? To meet Callum because I really miss him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure you can, um now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone was hung up and I waited for Lilianna to come to my house.  While accompanying Callum who was playing with Sophie in the front yard.  I&#39;ll prepare food for breakfast later after Lilianna gets here.  So we can have breakfast together at the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long before Lilianna suddenly arrived in front of my house.  She waved from a distance, of course at her son.  I woke Callum up so I could see his mother who was now getting closer to us.  Callum was surprised to see his mother coming here.  He spoke of Lilianna with great joy and without hesitation wanted to be on her lap when Lilianna was in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s your child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here, lap mother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilianna held Callum on her lap and kissed his head several times with great affection.  I enjoyed watching him witness the closeness between a mother and her biological child.  Without meaning to, my heart suddenly melted remembering what I shouldn&#39;t have done to Lilianna at that time.  It&#39;s true that I feel very guilty for Callum and Lilianna.  Moreover, it looks like I won&#39;t be able to unite with Lilianna because I have planned a wedding schedule with my girlfriend Massima Adelina.  Hopefully he can accept Callum&#39;s presence as her next child in the future.  Even though I can&#39;t imagine how I will tell Adel everything.  I was worried that she would be disappointed to hear that because I had been doing this with Lilianna since the moment I started having a relationship with Adel in the first year we started to have special closeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you had breakfast?&#34;  I asked Lilianna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because it&#39;s too early to visit my house to meet Callum.  So I think that she hasn&#39;t had time to eat breakfast yet.  So I will make special delicious food for the mother of my child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilianna shook her head when I asked whether she had breakfast or not.  That means she hasn&#39;t had breakfast yet.  So I immediately invited her to go to the kitchen and dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s make breakfast first, coincidentally Callum hasn&#39;t had breakfast either. I&#39;ll make something delicious for us to eat together, come on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilianna nodded and followed me into the house.  As for Sophie, I&#39;ll let her go free because she&#39;s been looking after Callum for too long.  So that she doesn&#39;t get bored, I let her breathe freely and feel free on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Callum hasn&#39;t eaten yet, has he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet.&#34;  Shake his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw Callum being talked to by his mother at the dinner table.  While I cook in the kitchen.  I will make food as quickly as possible to serve it immediately so that this stomach rumbling disappears quickly.  Because I&#39;ve started to feel hungry of course.  So now my stomach is demanding to be filled immediately.  Thus I made extra effort to quickly finish my cooking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally the dish I prepared is ready to be served.  I put it in a large container to take to the dining table so Lilianna and Callum could eat it deliciously and with gusto.  I&#39;m sure they will like the taste of my cooking because the aroma alone is very tempting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Done... The food is ready for us to eat together.&#34;  I voiced with a happy feeling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hooray.&#34;  Callum looks excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It smells so good, it turns out you&#39;re also good at cooking, Matteo.&#34;  Lilianna&#39;s words seemed to radiate amazed eyes at me.  I felt embarrassed and a bit out of style after Lilianna said something about me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Em... let&#39;s eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We started to take the food that was in front of us onto the plate that was in front of us.  Start putting food into each other&#39;s mouths.  Callum doesn&#39;t want help, he wants to eat with his own hands.   We started to focus on eating.  When I was just about to put in the third bite of food, suddenly my cell phone rang and felt it vibrating in my trouser pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo, it looks like it came from your cell phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately checked and sure enough there was an incoming call from Anthony&#39;s contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, there&#39;s a telephone. I&#39;ll answer the phone first, Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up and stood then walked a little away from Lilianna and Callum&#39;s position.  Because I was worried that there would be conversations between Anthony and I that were not suitable for other people to hear, especially women and children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up the phone after shifting from Callum and Lilianna&#39;s position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Anthony, what&#39;s wrong with you calling so early?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang bang bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I heard was the sound of gunfire and no sound of Anthony answering.  I immediately felt worried about Anthony&#39;s condition now.  Could it be that he experiences big problems like what I experienced yesterday when I accompanied Lilianna.  Woe!  I have to catch up with him now.  To make sure he was okay.  I will help him fight the people who might be attacking him right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Anthony, where are you now?&#34;</p>
