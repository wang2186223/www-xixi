                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Touch after touch that Matteo gave me made me even higher.  I really made him fly.  This is an experience I will never forget with him.  I never even thought this scene would happen here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo, you are really crazy.&#34;  I said while holding his neck with both my hands.  While his hands continued to grope my thigh area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re crazy too, Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled hearing that as if we were both crazy people who couldn&#39;t control their lust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to finish it soon?&#34;  I asked spoiled and hoped this wouldn&#39;t end now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34;  He released me by pushing me backwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I immediately remembered Sillas.  It looks like the event is over because Matteo and I have been making out here for a long time.  That&#39;s bad, if the event is really over then I&#39;m worried that someone will find out where Matteo is here.  I immediately made him aware by inviting him to immediately get out of this toilet.  So that no one can find him and he can escape safely from enemy pursuit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo, we have to leave here immediately before the event is over and all the invited guests disperse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes, you&#39;re right, I almost forgot about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo led me and we immediately ran outside while sneaking around.  Walk away from this building area.  Hoping no one would catch us walking out.  Matteo and I were almost far from the building we were in earlier.  I was really nervous because Matteo invited me to be someone he was hunting.  This is the first time I&#39;ve done something like this.  Sneak and hide so that no one can see we are here.  Until finally our steps took Matteo and me some distance from the building.  It looks like the event is on the verge of closing.  Because there were still lots of people cheering and the sound system which was still on echoed from the building there.  No one was seen leaving or dispersing yet.  I think Sillas is still there inside too.  I&#39;ll call him later so he doesn&#39;t feel anxious when I suddenly disappear from the event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo, let&#39;s just go back to your house!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you&#39;re right, before the event is over and they disperse, we have to leave here immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, just order a taxi online from your cell phone!&#34;  I asked, because if I ordered from my cell phone I was worried that one day it would be tracked by anyone who wanted Matteo and his whereabouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo immediately ordered a taxi online and it didn&#39;t take long for our order to arrive.  A car stopped right in front of us.  Matteo and I immediately went into it.  We immediately told the driver to leave immediately after being in the car.  The driver immediately drove this car.  The car was traveling at normal speed.  While I was in the car I thought of Sillas again.  I immediately called Sillas so that he wouldn&#39;t think anything wrong about me suddenly disappearing.  So that Sillas doesn&#39;t feel too worried and worried because I can&#39;t go home with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Silas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna, where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to be with my friend and will stay at his house for a while. Sorry it&#39;s so sudden but my friend really needs me right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what will I say later to Dad, Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just tell me what really happened according to what I&#39;m talking about!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um but, Lilianna...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately hung up the phone without waiting for Sillas&#39; response or reply.  I don&#39;t need that anymore and the most important thing is that I have provided information that will make Sillas less worried about me in the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve called your brother, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, so he doesn&#39;t worry too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, Sillas was my friend when I was at college.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, are you in the same class?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes that&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, this lady has arrived according to the route.&#34;  Suddenly he was stopped by the driver who told him that the car had arrived in front of Matteo&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah, okay, I&#39;ve arrived, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was immediately shocked and we immediately got out of the car.  He paid with a credit card online so he was automatically debited without having to pay with cash.  So we could get out of the car straight away.  Matteo and I walked into the house.  Finding the house was quiet, it seemed like the entire household was fast asleep.  Likewise with Callum and Sophie, Matteo and I saw him asleep by peeking between the doors which were not closed tightly.  After feeling everything was safe, Matteo and I suddenly had the idea to take a shower together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I entered Matteo&#39;s room and Matteo turned on the water tap in his bathroom.  Hot water is provided for us to bathe at nights like this.  In order to get rid of the cold feeling and dust that sticks to the pores of the body because it is swept away by the night wind.  For a moment Matteo and I went to the bath to get into the hot water together.  Immediately I remembered what Matteo said earlier in the car</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were interrupted because the taxi driver told us that we had arrived at our destination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Continue your previous story!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About you being friends with Sillas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, yes, Sillas was my best friend at that time. But after we graduated a dozen years ago, it seems like he started to forget about me. Because we never met face to face again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, especially if you haven&#39;t seen each other for years, there are usually lots of striking changes. Sometimes it&#39;s hard to recognize at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you&#39;re right, but it seems like if I say my name he will start to remember me again. Because we used to be very close and often did lots of activities together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that your cell phone sound?&#34;  Matteo asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, right&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in Matteo&#39;s arms and we were both in the same tub.  Leaning our head on Matteo&#39;s shoulder  we chatted.  But suddenly I was startled by the sound of my cell phone ringing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to reach for it without moving from the tub.  I looked at my cellphone screen and it turned out that the call had come from Sillas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sillas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, Sillas called again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s right, Sillas called me again. Don&#39;t you pick up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just disturbing our romantic atmosphere.  In the midst of feeling comfortable, Sillas broke everything up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just pick it up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I answered the phone from Sillas on Matteo&#39;s orders and permission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were still completely naked and in a tub filled with water and foamy soap covering our bodies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Sillas, what else is there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34;</p>
