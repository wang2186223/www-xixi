                <p>&#34;I have to act immediately to save all of them, especially Louis. Because he is part of my core team. If he succeeds in being persecuted then it will be a shame. All our big secrets will be revealed and they will know our next weak point. This becomes very vulnerable and makes me have to immediately release Louis and the others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then Matteo, hurry up and go to save them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo went away and left me at his house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after Matteo left a few minutes later.  Suddenly a group of people broke into the house and looked for Matteo and me.  But I couldn&#39;t dodge it and didn&#39;t have time to escape.  In fact, I was caught red-handed even when I was carrying Callum to go upstairs to his room.  It turns out they intended and tried to kill me and Callum.  They were targeting the two of us to weaken Matteo.  Because it seems they already know that Matteo has my child, Callum.  So they used Callum as one of the weapons to bring down Matteo.  They want Callum and me to die right now so that Matteo loses and finally gives himself up for free.</p>

                <p>&#34;Stay where Lilianna is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move an inch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahaha... Finally, we found you too Lilianna, give up or I&#39;ll shoot your child!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly I felt scared and immediately hugged Callum tightly.  Worried they would aim fire at Callum.  I really can&#39;t handle it alone.  Even the servants in Matteo&#39;s house didn&#39;t dare to come out of their respective hiding places.  I&#39;m just here standing with Callum, held captive by those who want to attack me.  Hoping there will be a miracle right now.  For example, Matteo suddenly came to save me and Callum here.  But I just feel like everything is just a dream and wishful thinking.  Because Matteo had clearly gone for something equally important.  Even Matteo doesn&#39;t know that Callum and I are in great danger here.  Both of our lives were in serious danger and there was no big possibility that we would survive the death that was starting to pounce on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly I could only pray and hope in my deepest heart.  Waiting for the miracle that I really hope for.  My eyes closed spontaneously.  My grip on Callum tightened.  Callum also closed his eyes and felt scared by this situation.  He seems to have matured and understands the dangers that threaten us now.  I was really confused about what to do other than just surrendering to a situation that was difficult for me to avoid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly a savior came.  I feel alive again.  After almost all, my heart weakened and finally stopped beating.  I felt like I had been watered by the water of new life.  I started to feel safe with the presence of the figure I was waiting for who would save us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, stop it! Or you&#39;ll all die by my hands!&#34;  Matteo shouted from the middle of the door with a sharp gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was sure that he didn&#39;t want Callum and me to get bad treatment from them, especially since Matteo saw them pointing a gun at the two of us.  I really believe that Matteo really hates people who attack small children.  Even those they attacked were their own biological children.  Surely Matteo would never keep quiet about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Matteo, step back! Or your wife and children will die right now from this shot from my hand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing what my wife said, I didn&#39;t really mind it.  Because the problem now is our very precarious situation.  Especially, Callum, I don&#39;t want anything wrong with Callum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, Matteo quickly and skillfully ran and kicked one of the hands of those who were pointing guns at the two of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blac Blac Blac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They immediately put on an amazing fighting action.  I&#39;ve just seen action like this, it&#39;s really amazing.  This is a fight that is quite surprising from the many fights I have witnessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang bang bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of gunfire continued to echo.  Matteo even ran towards me and took Callum from my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was suddenly shocked.  Luckily they didn&#39;t focus their attention on me and stayed on Matteo who was now carrying Callum while continuously firing shots at his opponent who was always targeting his movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was getting more and more unruly and screaming throughout this incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo be careful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo takes care of Callum!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued to voice my concerns.  But none of them were interested in aiming fire at me.  They were too busy with Matteo&#39;s movements who were good at grabbing attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang bang bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a lot of noise in this room.  Finally, one by one they were shot by Matteo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This room was filled with blood from heavy gunshots.   The room became more disorganized and very scattered.  I found myself already confused.  My hair even looked messy and my appearance seemed very shabby with sweat dripping down and my body temperature feeling hot because I was too scared.  In the end, all the opponents were paralyzed by being shot and some even died.  Then Matteo and I got closer to our opponents.  Try asking these people and asking about their motives for doing all this.  It turns out they planned to have the entire line dead and all the Italian hordes exterminated so they could expand their territory.  They also wanted me dead because I broke my promise to marry the boss&#39;s son while my father was still alive.  But their boss&#39;s son was killed in an Italian mob attack a year later after I had flatly refused to marry him.  So when their son died, they thought I was the mastermind behind the planned death that befell their boss&#39;s son.  They want me to suffer too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After this incident was over, Matteo and I had another sex scene as part of releasing the chaotic feelings left over from the incident.   Matteo and I want to grow the dopamine hormone in each of us.  Because once hard thoughts make the body&#39;s muscles feel tense and you really need something to relax them again.   For this reason, we do it in a planned way and build chemistry to be able to feel scene by scene so that it feels more alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After having sex we got information about the Russian mafia boss.  So Matteo and I immediately went to the place where they were allegedly gathering.  We started walking towards the place.  Matteo drives the car at high speed.  Until we got there.  We tried to sneak around to peek at the atmosphere inside.  We saw that his daughter, Aelita, who is my former future sister-in-law, was also in this place.  We saw that he joined his father&#39;s mafia group.  Matteo and I stalked from a distance.  Watching all their movements and starting to make sure that when things start to become possible we can immediately carry out an attack.  Matteo and I are still watching.</p>
