                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After my father and Sillas left forever.  Now I have to prepare myself to join the big mafia group that my father has been offering me.  Since he was still alive, I have always been identified as the future regeneration of his group.  Sure enough, it was my turn to take my father&#39;s power into my own hands without anyone dictating anymore.  My father is gone now, and so is my brother, too.  So now the responsibility is really on my shoulders.  I had to take it upon myself and start taking responsibility for everything.  Try and try to continue with confidence even though you don&#39;t have sufficient background experience, even if I am still completely raw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But by learning from experience after experience that happened in my life.  Then I will be able to overcome all the problems in the mafia world later.  Although I really find it difficult to get started.  But if I don&#39;t start then all my father&#39;s business will be in vain.  Businesses that have been built for a long time will go bankrupt drastically with nothing left.  I can&#39;t live in squalor.  Moreover, since birth I have been treated to and pampered by material things resulting from my father&#39;s hard work.  Even though in fact my father earned his income from haram businesses.  But if I stop here then I will be very adrift and have difficulty moving at first and will feel very stuttering in living life.  So I think I have to insist on continuing with great force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today is the day when I gather many of my late father&#39;s colleagues and subordinates.  Everyone was present without exception.  Here I started to act as a speaker who seemed skilled at leading meetings.  In theory, it might not be too difficult, but in practice in the field I still stare at the moon from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, thank you for coming to this meeting. I am Lilianna, the daughter of boss Alessio, who deliberately invited all my colleagues to attend to provide information regarding the continuation of this business which has been running for a long time. I hope all my colleagues will not mind if I attend.  suddenly in this group. Because I have to immediately make a decision and take over my father&#39;s position as the sole heir. Is there anyone who has objections or perhaps any suggestions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we can only accept what happened according to reality, Miss Lilianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s true, we can&#39;t refuse or object because everything is going according to procedures that are clearly stated in authentic matters. That in the heir&#39;s rights clearly refers to you as the sole heir of boss Alessio&#39;s business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, if everyone agrees, doesn&#39;t anyone else want to have an opinion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Miss, we think everything is clear and more than enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, thank you, then I will immediately make plans regarding the future of the business. As for several related matters that I need, I will immediately provide further information. That&#39;s enough for this meeting. Apart from that, I hope there will be no rumors.  behind. Because I have opened a forum to voice the opinions of everyone present here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After completing a meeting with the ranks of his late father&#39;s mafia group.  I immediately continued my other activities.  I thought that meeting Matteo and Callum was the next thing I would do.  So I immediately went to Matteo&#39;s house to meet Matteo and his child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I finally decided to go to Matteo&#39;s house.  I had heard some rumors that weren&#39;t good.  I feel like someone wants to throw me away from this mafia group.  There was a lot of conflict.  To the point that I heard a conversation between them that I accidentally overheard and they didn&#39;t know I was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, do you guys agree with Lilianna being our new boss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me, too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I think that a woman is not very capable of being the leader of a large mafia group like ours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what should we do now other than follow Lilianna&#39;s lead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carrying out covert rebellion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I agree.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will also take the stand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you look consolidated earlier?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah no, that&#39;s just acting. How could I want to be led by a weak woman who is also just a little kid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard it very clearly.  They appear unwilling to be led by a woman.  It seems like they are proud or maybe they are losing their competition and there is a hidden enemy behind that. But from here I began to understand that the mafia world is full of hypocrisy and it is very dangerous to trust people&#39;s responses too much.  I have to start anticipating and guarding myself from being touched by cunning evil hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately went to Matteo and asked for his opinion about all this.  When I arrived at Matteo&#39;s house, I found Callum being looked after by Shopie and asked him to leave the house area.  Now there is only Matteo in his office.  I approached him without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Matteo, what are you doing? Maybe my coming is bothering you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eh Lilianna you&#39;ve come, um... no! No! Your presence here doesn&#39;t bother me at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank goodness then, because there is something I want to tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it? Come on and tell me right away! I&#39;m ready to hear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You already know that I took over my father&#39;s power in the mafia group, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, oh yeah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t pretend you don&#39;t know about that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Erm... Just do it!&#34;  He said briefly as if he had heard my story even though I hadn&#39;t had time to say anything more than that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides, I already know who made bad comments and was a provocateur in your group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, how do you know? Where were you among us earlier?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo smiled faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve taken care of everything, you just have to wait for your subordinates&#39; next report.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you  mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A call came into my cell phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it! Pick it up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;  I was wide-eyed and had difficulty understanding the strange situation that was happening right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Lilianna, I have bad news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The two most influential people in our business have just passed away. The most loyal people and trusted people of your late father, Miss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Why did he suddenly die? What actually happened? Tell me quickly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone shot him in the back when we were hanging out at a coffee place after that meeting.&#34;</p>
