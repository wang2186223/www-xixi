                <p>When Lilianna witnesses her lover’s murder, she discovers both their fathers are rival mafia kings. Traumatized, she drowns her sorrows in a bar and wakes up in bed with a stranger—Matteo, heir to a crime dynasty. Three years later, their accidental son binds them together just as Matteo launches a brutal war against her family. Caught between her mafia lord father and the man whose touch ignites her blood, Lilianna must protect her child while navigating a labyrinth of betrayal and vengeance. In a world where loyalty means death and desire is a weapon, survival demands an unthinkable choice: destroy her family or lose everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night was as dark as my feelings now, which had just been confronted by a big problem.  I never thought that everything would just happen like that.  The night breeze hit my face with the dust it carried.  I couldn&#39;t resist it in the slightest and even my face was swept to the left without tolerance.  Night fog blocks the roads in this city.  The streets are so gloomy, like what I&#39;m feeling now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moscow became very mournful when the weather started to become extreme like I had just been moved in by my lover.  Not just a temporary stay but definitely forever.  It&#39;s no longer about breaking up or being cheated on.  I just lost my lover, he died before my eyes in tragic circumstances.  His face was covered in blood and he was forcefully dragged until I couldn&#39;t defend him at all.  I can only see it from quite a distance while hiding.  It all started with a shot aimed at me.  But it missed my lover, Jeremy Petrov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he died I could only watch him fall helplessly.  He is the lover who made me fall in love the most.  When he died, I found out that he was the son of a mafia boss named Vlad Petrov.  A Mafia boss who is very famous in Russia even has many subordinates, almost one country is subject to him, not just states.  The incident was very astonishing and long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is how it started, I was having a romantic dinner at a luxury restaurant in the Moscow area last afternoon.  My boyfriend Jeremy picked me up from my residence in his luxury car and invited me in like a king&#39;s consort.  Everything seemed sweet at first until when we started to enter the restaurant I suspected that someone had been watching our movements since I first got into the car in front of my house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things became very scary when several people suddenly attacked with guns.  We can only raise our hands because we have clean hands without weapons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Raise your hands!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone here lay down or I&#39;ll put ammunition in your brains right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the restaurant visitors followed orders and they immediately fell down rather than have their heads exploded ridiculously.  I also raised my hand along with Jeremy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hand over the woman beside you!&#34;  Pointing at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! What reason do you have for forcing me to hand over Lilianna?&#34;  Jeremy was half angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to know the reason. Come on, don&#39;t ask too many questions before I end your lives one by one.&#34;  They kept forcing Jeremy to just hand me over to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, one of Jeremy&#39;s hands tried to hold me tightly.  I hope I don&#39;t slip out of his grasp.  He looked after me very hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, who told you to? How dare you!&#34;  Jeremy started to dare to shout at the strange humans who were pointing guns at the two of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You dare to us huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to worry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They immediately pointed the gun at Jeremy&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could only stare and stare, swallowing saliva deeply.  Don&#39;t know how to deal with all this.  Obviously I have no martial arts skills.  But Jeremy immediately kicked the hands of the people who were pointing the gun at his head one by one.  Until they fell to the ground after Jeremy managed to kick them and their gun was thrown some distance from where they fell.  We immediately got closer to each other and looked at each other&#39;s surroundings, turning our bodies to share the roles of each other&#39;s eyes.  Maybe Jeremy was really curious about the mastermind behind all this incident.  Jeremy bravely stepped on one of them&#39;s feet and asked about their boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, admit who told you to?&#34;  While stepping on the hand of one of them with a thick and hard shoe sole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His other friends started to get closer and wanted to try to help their friend who had been stepped on by his hands by trying to attack Jeremy in a gang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t come any closer or your friend&#39;s arm will break!&#34;  Jeremy threatened the gang who were trying to attack him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, confess! Or I&#39;ll stomp harder!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aaaaa... Sorry. Yes, yes, I will tell you. But loosen your steps.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy loosened his foot a little and the man started to speak the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were ordered by our boss Enzo Costello&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is Enzo Costello? And what was his motive for telling you to kidnap Lilianna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enzo Costello is a mafia boss who is a close friend of Lilianna&#39;s father, Alessio, who is also a mafia boss from another area. The two of them are allied in wanting to destroy your father Vlad Petrov&#39;s power as the biggest mafia boss in Russia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was stunned to hear this testimony.  In fact, I just found out that my father and Jeremy&#39;s father were both big mafia figures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what does this have to do with kidnapping Lilianna? Isn&#39;t there another way to fight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our boss Enzo doesn&#39;t want his friend Alessio&#39;s son to be close friends with Vlad&#39;s son and even have to have a special relationship or be in a relationship. He would prefer if his son Alessio could become his son-in-law. However, after we found out that you guys had already planned a wedding date, it would be better if Lilianna were just killed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;  I was shocked to hear that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly one of them tried to point a gun at me at a very close distance.  I was not able to dodge or fight him in the slightest.  As for Jeremy, I saw that he was starting to get confused and out of control.  He forgot he was stepping on someone until he turned his attention to me and ignored the situation that could have threatened him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh, where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilianna, let&#39;s run!&#34;  Jeremy shouted, full of worry and anxiety at my current situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person who was pointing the gun looked at Jeremy so I could run away when he was caught off guard by me.  Until he started to wake up and told me to stay where he was.  I had time to obey him by staying in place.  But again and again Jeremy told me to keep running from here and hiding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, stop! Stay where you are!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Don&#39;t Lilianna! You keep running and hiding!&#34;  Jeremy said.</p>
