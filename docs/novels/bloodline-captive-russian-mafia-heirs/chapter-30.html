                <p>Matteo&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly the bullets from my gun ran out when I was about to fire several more times.  I immediately threw away the gun I was holding.  Then I took back the other gun which I also kept under my jacket.  I keep a lot of weapons in me.  Both firearms and sharp weapons.  I always do this when I&#39;m going anywhere.  Anticipate everything by being alert in my every move.  Because something bad could happen suddenly like this.  For this reason, I have always been alert in my life since I found out that I was the son of Enzo Castello, a famous mafia boss in Russia.  Not to mention, since I started joining this mafia group, I have also been more careful in looking after myself.  So I always prepare anything that will be a weapon for me against the opponent who is always targeting me whenever and wherever I am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They continued to chase me until I stopped because the road suddenly came to a dead end.  We were suddenly on quite high ground.  Without realizing it, the chase brought me here.  Now I started to turn around and meanwhile they were getting closer to me.  Not only that, they also pointed a gun at me.  Threatening me to stay where I am or I have two equally bad choices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remain still!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, stand there or there will only be two choices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to parachute and fall down or will we shoot you straight in the head?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead if you can!&#34;  I challenged him without the slightest fear.  Because he is used to tense situations like this.  I will look for ideas as quickly as possible to avoid them and survive this situation.  I will never give up even in times of urgency.  I will continue to try to keep myself safe without having to raise my hand and give in and bend the knee to them.  They also won&#39;t find me dead in their hands.  That&#39;s just their wishful thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I am surrounded and have almost no way to escape and escape from their encirclement.  I swallowed my saliva and felt cornered.  They are getting closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just give up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bend your knees before us right now before you really die!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! I don&#39;t want to!&#34;  While throwing saliva to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, I&#39;ll challenge you!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feel this!&#34;  He aimed a shot at me.  But I can dodge and avoid it.  In the end, the shot didn&#39;t hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They became increasingly angry with my actions.  They looked like they wanted to arrest me immediately.  But I still tried to look as if I was still calm.  However, my conscience still felt quite deep worry.  Feeling threatened and almost having no way out of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang bang bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately fired bullets from my gun.  Several times it came out and hit one of them.  This made things even more tense and they started to be confused by my actions.  When I was about to shoot again, suddenly my bullets ran out again.  I didn&#39;t run out of methods and immediately took my weapon under my jacket.  I carry a lot of guns of course.  So you don&#39;t feel short of weapons.  Even in a situation of urgency or threat, I will not be afraid.  Moreover, I keep a lot of weapons in this area of my body.  Although the possibility is very dangerous if I am in a hot area.  Because it could make my body explode.  But I have a way to prevent that from happening.  I&#39;ve designed it that way.  So that I remain safe even though I have many weapons on my body that I keep and tuck away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before finally I took out my gun again and ran out of bullets.  They felt as if they had won a landslide victory over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahaha... Come on, get out your ammunition again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here, shoot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a few steps back when they were about to shoot me and came closer to me.  I swallowed deeply because I almost couldn&#39;t avoid it.  Moreover, I almost slipped down because this is a rather high place.  Meanwhile behind me is the limit.  I almost slipped and fell down.  But I have the balance and ability to survive.  I immediately took out my gun.  Until I shot them one by one.  Some hit the target, some missed.  But I continued to stick my tongue in without relaxing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had difficulty responding to me because my ability to use weapons could no longer be doubted.  I raised the weapon nimbly and while they were a bit slow.  They are like a new, amateur mafia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now there was a terrible shooting.  Shooting at each other and making the atmosphere chaotic.  People from around the building rushed out to see this incident.  We don&#39;t focus too much on them.  Just focus on shooting each other.  Hoping for victory and again my ammunition ran out.  I want to go back to carrying a weapon.  But it turned out that was my last gun.  There was only a knife left.  I immediately took it out and threw it at one of them.  But I failed because I was a bit nervous and couldn&#39;t hide it from myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahaha, what do you want now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your weapons have run out, haven&#39;t they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just give up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still survive with myself and my bare hands without any weapons at all.  I look left and right, no one wants to help me here.  I&#39;m really in a pinch right now.  Maybe I was too arrogant earlier.  So I feel like I will win again like before.  In some cases I always win.  But this time I seem to have to give up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They smiled with arrogant smiles.  I feel like I&#39;m really going to lose.  I had no other choice but to admit defeat.  Then I started to raise my hand and they laughed loudly, feeling that their efforts were not in vain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were getting closer to me, standing still like a statue.  I&#39;m at my wits&#39; end and my energy is starting to wane.  I already feel like this is the end of my life.  It looks like after this I will die, be killed by them or be held hostage first and then be made to die after being tortured first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They actually took me away after I admitted defeat.  The people who witnessed this did not move at all.  Maybe because they are afraid.  I walked resignedly while being escorted by my opponent.  Feeling like I have no hope for the next.  I really feel weak and helpless.  Go on as you are and just accept your next fate.  Don&#39;t know what they will do to me.  I can only imagine the worst things that could happen.  A terrible thing that I will get without being able to refuse it.  Now death is before my eyes.</p>
