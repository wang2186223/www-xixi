                <p>Matteo&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they left I rushed into the room while I let Lilianna continue to follow them.  When I was about to go inside, suddenly I was shocked by the sound of an explosion in this room.  This place exploded and I almost got hit by the explosion.  But luckily I quickly saved myself by running to the side.  In the end, I remained fine while they disappeared from my sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment I experienced an explosion in this room and lost track of them.  So I immediately ran to find their whereabouts.  Until I found them again in an unguarded state.  I immediately gave a blow to the father and daughter.  I hit Vlad Petrov and Aelita from behind on their legs and they fell until they were unconscious.  I immediately checked the situation and it turned out they died in my hands.  They both died on the spot without first breathing.  They actually died immediately with one hard blow from me.  I immediately claimed insurance with a nominal value of one hundred thousand dollars as proof of their death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I profited from both of their deaths.  In various ways, I tried to disburse their death money.  But it turned out to be a bit difficult.  So the rest of it was that Lilianna and I tried to enter the late Russian Don&#39;s office but still couldn&#39;t infiltrate the mafia&#39;s house without trying to shoot dead the people inside who were still guarding it.  The only way to have enough power to bring them down is to take control of the assets of Lilianna&#39;s father, who was once an ally of the late Vlad Petrov.  We ultimately decided to do it for the safety of our son Callum.  Lilianna and I  certainly went through a few more challenges and got closer to our goal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We went back to my house to rest for a while and make sure that Callum and Sophie were still safe.  Luckily the two of us leaving didn&#39;t bring disaster to the house so Callum remained safe with Sophie&#39;s care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After we were sure that everything was safe, we did a second sex scene as a remedy for fatigue after days of doing quite heavy and very challenging actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After having sex, Lilianna suddenly asked me about Callum&#39;s status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo, are you sure that Callum is your son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you ask like that, Lilianna? Tell me the truth, what&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I just want to say that he is really your son. So I want clarity about our relationship and future status.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I have to do a DNA test to convince myself that Callum is my biological child and the result of my biology?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, if necessary and so you don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m cheating you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, let&#39;s do a DNA test tomorrow. Once we know the truth of the results according to the facts stated then I will take firm action to make you my legal wife. How about that?&#34;  I went straight to the point and Lilianna smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>after hearing all my words just now.  Although I felt angry with Lilianna because she hid Callum&#39;s identity from me for two years before I found him in my life.  If I had never met Callum for free then I would never have known the fact that Callum was my own flesh and blood son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After having a serious conversation with Lilianna regarding Callum&#39;s future and his identity clearly.  I immediately said goodbye to going out alone.  This time I told Lilianna to stay at home to accompany Callum and Sophie.  Because I saw she was too tired.  If I take her out to clean things up now, I&#39;m worried that Lilianna will run out of energy and it could end up being a boomerang for our safety in the future.  So I hope he recovers her stamina first at this house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to go out for a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll find out later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurried to leave him alone in my room.  Meanwhile, I immediately do what is my goal now.  A few moments after the incident outside which drained my energy, I immediately returned home covered in blood.  I was attacked while traveling but I managed to kill all the attackers.  Seeing the current situation actually makes Lilianna feel betrayed by me.  Until she put some distance between us until she really found out the real story about what happened to me and the remaining men of the late Russian Don.  I don&#39;t know what Lilianna was thinking when she saw me like this.  But suddenly she changed her attitude towards me and acted strangely.  Lilianna suddenly decided to leave my house for no reason that I could understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes after she left, suddenly my cell phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked it up when I saw an incoming call from Lilianna and it made me frown, feeling strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Matteo, help me!! I was attacked by a group of people who were located not far from your house, approximately twenty meters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was immediately shocked and immediately followed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, wait, I&#39;ll go there immediately to save you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was at the scene that Lilianna was referring to, I was trapped by her.  It seems that Lilianna was also threatened and used to trick me into coming here.  Until I argued with a man who wanted me to come here.  From this, it can be revealed that the killer of Alessio and Sillas was actually Aelita&#39;s agent, Massima.  This is really a clever plot and difficult to predict.  They turned out to be women who were members of a mafia group and were the masterminds in it.  On this occasion, I managed to defeat several of them.  Some of them managed to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We went back to my house and now Lilianna decided to stay with me and never leave again for the reason of protecting Callum from getting involved in this dispute between the mafia.  In our free time, we did another third sex scene before we finally did a DNA test.  For some reason, we felt like we were starting to be possessed by the exciting atmosphere.  Even though we are not married, we feel like we are a legal husband and wife couple.  However, after we finished doing the DNA test and the results proved that Callum was my biological child, I immediately married Lilianna according to my promise to her.  We celebrated a lively wedding party and held family moments afterward as atonement for all my sins and mistakes towards the two of them so far.  I pay for all the time wasted together.  Now everything is fine, but of course, there is still a lot of mafia business to be resolved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>End.</p>
