                <p>Lilianna&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something unexpected happened suddenly.  When Matteo is really in danger.  I never thought that he would suddenly take out a knife from under his jacket.  Then he threw the knife he was holding at one of the attackers.  Until the knife managed to hit the target&#39;s cheek.  After everyone there started to get confused, I was surprised when Matteo took out a gun and fired in several directions and managed to hit the target.  About the five people who attacked him are now lying weak due to wounds on one of their bodies.  I don&#39;t know what they were talking about outside because it was soundproof here and no sound could be heard from outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just saw Matteo snatch a cell phone belonging to one of them.  Matteo also took out his cell phone and then seemed to be calling someone not long after.  When he was finished he just walked past them and then got into the car.  I didn&#39;t even dare to reprimand or ask him.  There was just a tense atmosphere between us in this car, especially when the car was moving.  Finally I arrived and throughout the journey there was no conversation.  I asked to get off at the flyover which is not far from my house.  Deliberately coming down here so as not to be caught by anyone, including my father&#39;s spies from his subordinates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just in front!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;  There were no protests or questions, Matteo simply fulfilled my request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today passed after I got home and slept as usual tonight.  Luckily my father wasn&#39;t at home.  It looks like he is having business activities outside the house.  Luckily I wasn&#39;t bothered by my father&#39;s often deadly questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night passed quickly, my thoughts were on Callum.  I want to meet him today.  Early in the morning after breakfast I called Matteo and wanted to come to his house.  Matteo was also happy to welcome me to his house this morning.  Without long, I immediately went to Matteo&#39;s house.  Until I arrived at his house and I was greeted by the smile of my son Callum.  It felt peaceful and he called me enthusiastically while running towards my position.  I welcomed him and kissed my son on his left and right cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Already eaten?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head, because it was still too early.  I came here too early because my mind kept thinking about Callum.  So that forced my body to go straight here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s make breakfast!&#34;  Invite Matteo to be enthusiastic about me and his son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We also enthusiastically rushed to the kitchen.  Now we look like a small family full of happiness and very harmonious. Even though Matteo and I are not in any relationship, let alone marriage.  But thanks to Callum&#39;s presence, we are very close and even like a married couple raising children with love and gender roles as a father and a mother.  We are so united in raising Callum.  Until Callum actually looks very happy.  Even though he didn&#39;t quite understand the situation his parents were experiencing.  I really feel like I have sinned against Callum and haven&#39;t been able to make amends to him.  Maybe Matteo also feels and thinks this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see that Matteo is very skilled at forcing things.  It turns out he is not only good at martial arts.  But he also has other skills, namely cooking skills.  I was quite impressed with his skills which deserved a thumbs up.  I think he is a man who, like men in general, upholds patriarchy towards women.  But the reality is not that he is truly independent and does not differentiate between women&#39;s work and men&#39;s work.  I felt fascinated when I saw his style of cooking.  He seems cool and quite interesting.  It turns out that Matteo looks handsome too.  It seemed like he had finished cooking and was now serving food in large containers to be brought to the dining table.  Meanwhile Callum and I had been waiting at the dining table while Matteo cooked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While accompanying Matteo because the distance between the dining table and the kitchen is not far.  So I can occasionally pay attention to Matteo&#39;s movements by stealing glances without Matteo knowing.  Because if Matteo caught me watching him, I would be very embarrassed because I was caught.  Matteo came towards us carrying food served in a container that he carried in both hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Taraaaaa... Done, let&#39;s eat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plates, glasses, spoons, forks and knives have been available here for a long time.  I had time to organize it.  Here the drinks brought from the refrigerator are ready on the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Want to sit near, daddy.&#34;  Callum said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I helped Callum get down from the chair next to me and moved him to the chair near Matteo right next to him.  I returned to my original seat.  I had the chance to see Matteo and Callum, it turned out that if I looked closely at the closeness of Callum and Matteo, they were very similar and very handsome.  I was amazed at the beauty of the two of them and started to get lost in crazy fantasies.  Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted when the telephone rang, the sound came from Matteo&#39;s cell phone which he kept in his trouser pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I had time to think about how Matteo could be sure that Callum was his biological child.  Even though they have never had a DNA test.  But Matteo seemed to be completely sure that Callum was his baby from his sperm.  Even though at the beginning of the conversation he accused me of playing crazy with other men.  He initially seemed a little doubtful about Callum&#39;s status as his biological son.  Even though it is true that Callum is real flesh and blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s your cell phone ringing, vibrating. Looks like someone is trying to call you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, let me pick you up first, wait here for a moment, then we&#39;ll eat together, don&#39;t go anywhere yet! Keep Callum here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Matteo.&#34;  I didn&#39;t say much more because it seemed like the call was very important so Matteo walked a little away from my position.  I just left him like that and didn&#39;t look at him so he wouldn&#39;t feel disturbed.  But I still hear his voice when he answers the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Anthony? What&#39;s wrong with you calling me so early in the morning?&#34;  Looks like a very serious person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There seemed to be no sound from there.  So Matteo changed the setting to loud speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang bang bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gunshot was heard from inside the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anthony?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo seemed to be starting to panic.</p>
