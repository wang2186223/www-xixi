                <p>Angela POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ready,&#34; I told Sophie over the phone. &#34;See you in thirty minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been three days since our coffee shop conversation. After my sleepless night, I felt both exhausted and strangely calm. The decision was made - there was no point in tormenting myself anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Sophie arrived at our penthouse, Sean was just stepping out of his private study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Going somewhere?&#34; Sean&#39;s eyes moved between Sophie and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None of your business.&#34; Sophie&#39;s voice could have frozen the Hudson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;Angela hasn&#39;t been well. She should be resting at home, not going out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, now you care about her health?&#34; Sophie&#39;s laugh was brittle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you ever wondered why she&#39;s not well? She was on the gymnastics team in college, remember? The healthiest girl I knew. But look at her now - she&#39;s lost so much weight since marrying you, getting weaker by the day. Is this how the great Shaw family takes care of its own?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my heart rate spike. Sophie had been furious since I told her about my plans, and now I could see that anger bubbling to the surface. One wrong word about the pregnancy, and everything would fall apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough.&#34; I cut in, my voice sharper than intended. &#34;We&#39;re going to be late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I practically dragged Sophie toward the elevator, feeling Sean&#39;s gaze boring into my back. Only when we were safely in Sophie&#39;s Mercedes did I let out the breath I&#39;d been holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He deserved worse,&#34; Sophie muttered, pulling into traffic with more force than necessary. &#34;The way he&#39;s treating you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; I interrupted. &#34;I can&#39;t... I can&#39;t think about him right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The private clinic was hidden in an elegant suburban mansion, with only a small brass plaque marking its presence. Everything about it spoke of discretion and luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why here?&#34; Sophie asked quietly. &#34;We could have gone to New York-Presbyterian or Mount Sinai. They have the best facilities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too many familiar faces.&#34; I stared at my perfectly manicured hands, focusing on keeping them steady. &#34;Elizabeth&#39;s entire social circle practically lives at those hospitals&#39; charity boards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist called my name - my real name, not Mrs. Shaw - and led us to a private consultation room. The doctor was younger than I expected, with kind eyes and a gentle manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two month along,&#34; she confirmed, reviewing my paperwork. &#34;The procedure is relatively simple at this stage. We can schedule it for-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Today,&#34; I cut in. &#34;It needs to be today.&#34; I couldn&#39;t bear to drag this out any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor&#39;s eyes flickered between Sophie and me. &#34;There&#39;s a mandatory waiting period-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand the risks. I&#39;ve made my decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie&#39;s phone buzzed, breaking the tension. She glanced at it, frowning, then declined the call. Seconds later, it buzzed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take it,&#34; I said softly. &#34;It might be important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing&#39;s more important than-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophie.&#34; I managed a small smile. &#34;I&#39;ll be fine for a few minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Sophie left, I went to the restroom. The corridor was filled with well-dressed women, barely any men in sight. Everyone kept to themselves, lost in their own thoughts. The silence spoke volumes - each woman here carried her own secret, her own burden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand drifted to my still-flat stomach. I&#39;m sorry, I thought. I&#39;m so sorry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela? Is that you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice made my blood run cold. I turned to find Rachel Miller - Shaw family friend, society gossip, and Elizabeth&#39;s bridge partner - standing in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rachel.&#34; I forced my features into a polite smile. &#34;What a surprise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it just?&#34; Her perfectly lined eyes swept over my figure. &#34;I never expected to see you here, of all places. Nothing serious, I hope? Nothing that the Shaw family lawyers should know about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just accompanying a friend,&#34; I said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh?&#34; Rachel&#39;s perfectly lined eyes narrowed. &#34;I don&#39;t see any friend with you. You know, Elizabeth always speaks so highly of you... I hope you&#39;re not keeping any secrets from her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flared in my chest. &#34;Mrs. Miller, be careful with your accusations. I could sue you for defamation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel&#39;s expression quickly shifted to a practiced smile. &#34;Dear, I was just joking. Why so defensive? Unless you&#39;re-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, a young girl emerged from one of the consultation rooms. My heart stopped - it was Rachel&#39;s daughter, Jessica. She looked pale, clutching what appeared to be a medical report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom?&#34; Jessica&#39;s voice trembled slightly when she saw Rachel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from Rachel&#39;s face. Mother and daughter stared at each other, the air thick with unspoken words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could guess why Jessica was here - she must be pregnant too. While I usually had no interest in other people&#39;s private affairs, I felt compelled to speak before Rachel could leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rachel,&#34; I said in a low voice. &#34;Don&#39;t tell anyone about seeing me here today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew her gossiping nature well, and how she always competed with Elizabeth behind the scenes. But Rachel&#39;s lips curled into a sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you think you are to threaten me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t want anyone to know about Jessica&#39;s pregnancy either,&#34; I replied coolly. &#34;She&#39;s only just started college, isn&#39;t she? And not married...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel&#39;s face contorted with rage before she stormed off, practically dragging Jessica with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie returned shortly after, leading me to the reception desk to handle the pre-procedure paperwork. As we waited, raised voices caught my attention. In the corner of the waiting area, Rachel and Jessica were having a heated argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t keep this baby!&#34; Rachel&#39;s voice was shrill despite her attempt to keep it down. &#34;That boy is penniless - he&#39;ll never be able to give you the life you deserve!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But we&#39;re in love!&#34; Jessica&#39;s eyes were brimming with tears. &#34;I want to keep this baby. It&#39;s a living being - your grandchild! How can you be so cruel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Rachel could respond, Jessica turned and ran out of the clinic, leaving her mother standing there helplessly. Their argument left me unsettled, stirring up the doubts I&#39;d been trying so hard to suppress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden scream from the operating floor above made me flinch, the sound cutting through the artificial calm of the waiting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the chaos of emotions threatened to overwhelm me, my phone buzzed with a text message. I opened it:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela, I need to see you. Just the two of us. We need to talk. -Christina&#34;</p>
