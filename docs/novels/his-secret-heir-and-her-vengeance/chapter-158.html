                <p>Angela POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a cold laugh. &#34;You&#39;re giving yourself too much credit. Green eyes aren&#39;t exactly rare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If they&#39;re not mine,&#34; Sean countered smoothly, &#34;then whose are they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question hung between us like a blade. I clenched my jaw, fury building in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re not yours,&#34; I hissed. &#34;You have no right to them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean stepped closer, his voice dropping to that dangerous, silky tone I remembered all too well. &#34;Even without a DNA test, I&#39;m certain they&#39;re my children, Angela. It&#39;s obvious they&#39;re my flesh and blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve been divorced for five years,&#34; I shot back. &#34;You have no legal right to demand anything from my children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our divorce was finalized when you were already pregnant,&#34; Sean observed, his eyes never leaving mine. &#34;A fact you conveniently failed to mention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fell silent, memories flooding back-five years ago, when I had texted him about my pregnancy. His response had been nothing but silence, followed by insisting on our divorce. He clearly hadn&#39;t wanted our children. That painful rejection had sealed my decision to leave without further discussion about the pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want to fulfill my responsibilities as their father,&#34; Sean continued, his tone softening slightly. &#34;I&#39;ve missed five years of their lives already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s rich,&#34; I snapped. &#34;You didn&#39;t even know they existed until recently, and now suddenly you want to play the devoted father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I acknowledge my failings,&#34; he admitted, shocking me with his candor. &#34;But I have the resources to give them everything they deserve-the Shaw family name, the best education, opportunities beyond what you could imagine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were doing perfectly fine without you,&#34; I countered, stepping back. &#34;Don&#39;t disrupt the life we&#39;ve built just because your conscience is suddenly bothering you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;They&#39;re my children too, Angela. If necessary, I have an entire legal team prepared to establish my parental rights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something cold and primal surged through me-the fierce protective instinct of a mother. I turned away, my voice low and dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one will take my children,&#34; I warned. &#34;Not even you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the school, I immediately transformed my expression, softening my features as Aria spotted me and came running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy!&#34; she called excitedly. &#34;Did you talk to Mr. Night? Isn&#39;t he handsome?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knelt down, embracing her tightly. &#34;Aria, sweetheart, I need you to promise me something. You can&#39;t eat the food Mr. Night brings anymore, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her small face crumpled in confusion. &#34;But why? His food is so yummy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because...&#34; I hesitated, searching for words a five-year-old would understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy,&#34; Aria interrupted, her eyes lighting up with inspiration, &#34;why don&#39;t you just let Mr. Night be my daddy? Then it would be okay, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze, her innocent suggestion striking me like a physical blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It sounds like an excellent proposal,&#34; Sean&#39;s smooth voice came from behind me. I hadn&#39;t even heard him approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood, positioning myself slightly in front of Aria. &#34;Mr. Shaw,&#34; I greeted icily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Wilson,&#34; he nodded, then smiled warmly at my daughter. &#34;Aria seems quite fond of me. Perhaps you should consider her suggestion seriously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Night,&#34; Aria tugged at his sleeve, &#34;do you like my mommy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean crouched down to her level, his eyes twinkling with calculated charm. &#34;I liked your mommy from the very first moment I saw her. Love at first sight, you might say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s love at first sight?&#34; Aria asked, fascinated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It means Mr. Night admires your mother very much,&#34; Sean explained gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recognized his strategy immediately-using the children to manipulate the situation. I&#39;d seen him deploy similar tactics in business negotiations countless times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aria, Ethan,&#34; I interjected firmly, &#34;it&#39;s time to return to class.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan, who had been watching silently from a few feet away, approached cautiously. I noticed how he deliberately avoided coming too close to Sean-a stark contrast to his previously reported friendliness toward &#34;Mr. Night.&#34; This brought me a sense of relief; my more mature Ethan always stood firmly by my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Tommy prepared to follow them, he glanced uncertainly at Sean, who gave him a subtle nod of permission. The interaction confirmed my suspicions about their relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the children gone, I began mechanically gathering the elaborate lunch spread from the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t touch that,&#34; Sean said sharply. &#34;I&#39;ve arranged for it to be taken care of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arched an eyebrow. &#34;You clean up after yourself now? I thought the Shaw family was above such menial tasks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tommy isn&#39;t actually my relative,&#34; Sean admitted unexpectedly. &#34;He&#39;s from a distant branch of the Shaw family. I arranged for him to attend this school to facilitate my relationship with the twins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The casual admission of his manipulation infuriated me. &#34;You used an innocent child as a pawn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m providing him with opportunities he wouldn&#39;t otherwise have,&#34; Sean countered. &#34;His family is grateful. And it allowed me to know my children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They were doing perfectly fine without you,&#34; I repeated, gathering my purse. &#34;We don&#39;t need Shaw money or Shaw opportunities. We just need peace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean remained seated, watching me intently. &#34;I&#39;ve already set up education trust funds for them. It&#39;s the least I can do after missing five years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned away, exhaustion suddenly weighing heavily on my shoulders. &#34;Stay away from us, Sean. Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at my office, I couldn&#39;t focus on work. Files remained untouched on my desk as I stared blankly at my computer screen, mind racing with contingency plans. What if Sean pursued legal action? What rights did he have after five years of absence, even if unintentional?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By late afternoon, Marcus stopped by my office, concern etched on his face. &#34;Angela? We need your input on the Davidson portfolio.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not now,&#34; I replied distractedly, gathering my belongings. &#34;I need to pick up the children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I drove to the school, an unexplainable sense of dread built in my chest. The afternoon traffic seemed deliberately designed to slow my progress, each red light a personal affront.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally arrived, the administrative assistant&#39;s expression immediately set off alarms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Wilson,&#34; she began hesitantly, &#34;the children have already been picked up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I gripped the counter. &#34;By whom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Their father,&#34; she replied, checking her records. &#34;Mr. Shaw. He&#39;s on the approved list.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never put him on any list!&#34; I protested, panic rising in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, but he showed proper identification and legal documents. The children seemed to know him well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fumbling for my phone, I dialed Sean&#39;s number repeatedly, each unanswered call increasing my panic. After the sixth attempt, I made my decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to the Shaw Tower,&#34; I said through clenched teeth, already heading for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I drove toward midtown, I dialed my attorney&#39;s number with trembling fingers. My hands shook with a mixture of fear and fury as I gripped the steering wheel. Sean Shaw had just declared war on the wrong mother.</p>
