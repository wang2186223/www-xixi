                <p>Angela POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened in disbelief, bloodshot from alcohol but still that unmistakable emerald green. For a moment, he just stared, his breath catching as if he&#39;d been punched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela?&#34; he whispered, his voice breaking. &#34;Is that really you or am I hallucinating?&#34; His fingers trembled as they reached up to touch my face, hesitant and uncertain, as if I might dissolve under his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The overwhelming stench of whiskey hit me as he leaned closer. I had no idea how much he&#39;d been drinking tonight, but it was enough to make my eyes water. his thumb tracing the outline of my cheekbone in a gesture so achingly familiar it made my heart constrict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t be real,&#34; he murmured, his eyes filling with a mixture of wonder and pain. &#34;I&#39;ve dreamed of finding you so many times...&#34; His fingers tangled in my hair, the touch both gentle and desperate. &#34;Tell me I&#39;m not imagining this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the war of emotions playing across his features-anger, hurt, longing, and beneath it all, a raw vulnerability that the alcohol had stripped bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of me, Sean!&#34; I hissed, struggling against his grip, trying to ignore how my body still betrayed me with its response to his touch after all these years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze focused slightly at the sound of my voice, those green eyes-the same ones I saw every day in Ethan&#39;s face-searching mine with painful intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers continued their exploration, tracing the contours of my face as if committing them to memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is you,&#34; he breathed, the revelation seeming to hit him anew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you go? Why did you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words slurred slightly as he swayed, his weight pressing me further against the wall. His eyes dropped to my lips, and I knew exactly what he was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sean Shaw, if you dare kiss me, I swear you&#39;ll regret it,&#34; I warned, my voice deadly cold despite my hammering heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, his body went slack against mine, his considerable weight nearly crushing me as he collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angel,&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to push him away and stand up, but his arms instinctively tightened around me, pulling me closer in his drunken state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed to have forgotten we were in a public place, his hand moving to the back of my head, pressing it against his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips found my neck, the stubble of his five o&#39;clock shadow scraping against my sensitive skin as he planted heated kisses along my collarbone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unwelcome electric current shot through my body, awakening sensations I&#39;d fought to forget for five years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I was paralyzed, caught between past and present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela? Where are you?&#34; Olivia&#39;s voice cut through the fog of confusion, snapping me back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged through me. I pushed Sean away from me, desperate to create distance before Olivia appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden movement caused him to fall backward, and I instinctively grabbed for him to prevent injury. The motion threw me off balance, and we both tumbled to the floor just as Olivia appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela! What on earth is going on?&#34; Olivia gasped, her eyes wide with shock at the scene before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rose with as much dignity as I could muster, smoothing my dress with practiced composure. &#34;This drunk tried to harass me,&#34; I said coolly, the lie slipping easily from my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harass you?&#34; Olivia&#39;s voice rose in disbelief. &#34;No, that can&#39;t be right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched with growing horror as Olivia knelt beside Sean, gently turning his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is him-the man I&#39;ve been telling you about! He must have had too much to drink tonight. He&#39;s not usually like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit me like a physical blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia&#39;s mystery man-the one she&#39;d been obsessing over, the one whose &#34;emerald eyes&#34; she&#39;d been rhapsodizing about-was Sean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My Ex-husband. The father of my children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A true gentleman maintains his self-control even when intoxicated,&#34; I replied icily, fighting to keep my voice steady. &#34;Alcohol merely reveals one&#39;s true nature.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t understand,&#34; Olivia insisted. &#34;He&#39;s always so polite and dignified. I&#39;ve never seen him disrespect a woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found myself in an impossible position. I wanted to warn Olivia about Sean&#39;s complicated history, about Christina, but couldn&#39;t reveal how I knew without exposing our past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should get going,&#34; Olivia suggested. &#34;You go ahead. I&#39;ll make sure he&#39;s alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You barely know him,&#34; I protested, genuine concern for her safety mingling with a strange, unwelcome possessiveness. &#34;That&#39;s dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia&#39;s face softened with determination. &#34;If there are consequences, they&#39;re mine to bear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much do you actually know about him?&#34; I asked carefully, trying to gauge exactly what Olivia understood about Sean&#39;s life. &#34;His personal life? Is he... seeing anyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s definitely single,&#34; Olivia insisted with such confidence that I nearly laughed. &#34;If he were married or had a girlfriend, he wouldn&#39;t be drinking alone in bars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my resolve hardening. &#34;I can&#39;t let you take this risk, Olivia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s gotten into you tonight?&#34; Olivia&#39;s eyes narrowed with suspicion. &#34;I&#39;ve never seen you this tense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of internal debate, I relented slightly. &#34;How do you plan to handle this situation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a hotel nearby. I&#39;ll help him get a room to sleep it off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I conceded, seeing no other option that wouldn&#39;t raise more questions. &#34;We&#39;ll get him to a hotel, make sure he&#39;s safe, then leave immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Plaza Hotel&#39;s elegant lobby was nearly empty when we arrived, having managed to half-carry, half-drag Sean through the entrance. Olivia approached the front desk, leaving me struggling to support Sean&#39;s weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite myself, I noticed the familiar scent of citrus mingled with whiskey that clung to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His unconscious face was relaxed, years of tension erased in sleep, making him look almost like the boy I had known in my youth. A dangerous nostalgia tugged at my heart, and I ruthlessly suppressed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need a room for tonight,&#34; Olivia was saying to the receptionist. &#34;My friend is... unwell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist looked skeptically at Sean&#39;s slumped form. &#34;I&#39;ll need the guest&#39;s identification for check-in purposes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s indisposed at the moment,&#34; Olivia explained. &#34;Can&#39;t we make an exception? He&#39;s an important client.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, madam. Hotel policy requires-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; I interrupted, stepping forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, I reached into Sean&#39;s inner jacket pocket where he had always kept his wallet, extracted it, and removed his ID card and credit card, which I handed to the receptionist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when I caught Olivia staring at me, mouth slightly agape, did I realize my mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know where his wallet was?&#34; she asked, suspicion clouding her features.</p>
