                <p>Angela POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean lifted me from the town car as if I weighed nothing, cradling me against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His steady heartbeat against my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For just a moment, I allowed myself to sink into his warmth, to pretend this tenderness meant something more than obligation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind us, Christina&#39;s Louboutins clicked against the floor in perfect rhythm, each step a reminder of her unwanted presence in my home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean gestured toward the living room. &#34;Christina, please make yourself comfortable. Sarah, would you bring Miss Jordan some lemon water?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still remember,&#34; Christina&#39;s smile carried years of shared history. &#34;Though I suppose some things never change. This place looks exactly the same as it did two years ago - you never were one for redecorating, Sean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The casual familiarity in her voice made my stomach turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course she knew every detail of this home - she&#39;d practically lived here before our marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to look away as she settled onto the leather sofa with the ease of someone returning to their rightful place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps this was always meant to be her home, I thought. I&#39;m just keeping her seat warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean carried me toward the master bathroom, his movements careful but sure. The marble countertops gleamed under soft lighting as he set me down, steadying me with one arm while reaching for my shirt with his other hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat that had nothing to do with my fever rushed to my face as his fingers slipped beneath the hem of my shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can manage,&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can barely stand,&#34; he said softly, continuing his gentle but methodical undressing. &#34;Besides, it&#39;s nothing I haven&#39;t seen before. Don&#39;t be shy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intimacy of the moment shattered as Christina appeared in the doorway, still carrying her lemon water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me help,&#34; she offered, setting her glass aside. &#34;I have a medical degree, after all. I know exactly how to care for patients in this condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched Sean&#39;s reflection in the mirror, a part of me desperately hoping he would refuse, would insist on staying. But of course, that was just another foolish fantasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, he stepped back. &#34;I&#39;ll be in my study if you need anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door closed behind him with a quiet click, leaving me alone with the woman who knew every inch of this home as well as I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take it from here,&#34; she announced, reaching for my blouse buttons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swear, this is the weirdest thing that&#39;s ever happened to me:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My husband&#39;s lover gave me a bath!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My, you&#39;ve gotten thin,&#34;  she exclaimed, genuine surprise coloring her voice.&#34;Men generally prefer women with more curves, you know. Sean especially - he&#39;s always appreciated a more... feminine figure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; I met her gaze in the mirror. My voice came out colder than intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In two years of marriage, Sean had never once mentioned his preferences in women. Perhaps it didn&#39;t matter whether I was thin or curvy - he simply didn&#39;t care about me at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but notice Christina&#39;s perfect curves reflected in the mirror. So this was the type of figure Sean preferred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These past two years... you&#39;ve done Sean such a service, helping him maintain appearances in society. Though I imagine it must have been difficult, playing the role of Mrs. Shaw when everyone knows it&#39;s temporary.&#34; Christina smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes, too exhausted to maintain the pretense of polite society any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to worry about me, Christina. I know my place in Sean&#39;s life - and yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The position by his side will always be reserved for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something flickered in her eyes - triumph, perhaps, or uncertainty. Before she could respond, a knock at the door announced Sean&#39;s return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect timing,&#34; Christina called back. &#34;I was just about to help Angela out of the bath. Though perhaps you should wait in the other room - we wouldn&#39;t want to make anyone uncomfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should drive you home later,&#34; Sean told Christina after helping me back to my room. But Christina shook her head, her perfect smile never wavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I insist on staying the night,&#34; she said softly. &#34;Angela needs proper medical supervision, and I&#39;d feel terrible if something happened while I wasn&#39;t here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean hesitated for just a moment before nodding. &#34;I&#39;ll prepare the guest room for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain in my chest had nothing to do with my fever as I watched him lead Christina down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even waited for our divorce to be final before moving into our home. But what right did I have to object?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I retreated to my room, trying to ignore the sound of Sean&#39;s voice giving instructions to the staff about preparing Christina&#39;s accommodations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, tucked into bed with fresh cooling cloths on my forehead, I heard footsteps approaching. Sean appeared in the doorway, a glass of water in one hand and my medication in the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to take these,&#34; he said, his voice gentler than I&#39;d heard it in months. He sat on the edge of my bed, the mattress dipping slightly under his weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I managed, already anticipating his departure. &#34;You don&#39;t have to stay. I&#39;m sure Christina-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m staying until you fall asleep.&#34; The words were quiet but firm, brooking no argument. &#34;Take your medicine, Angela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tenderness caught me off guard. It had been so long since he&#39;d shown this side of himself - the Sean I&#39;d known before contracts and convenient arrangements had complicated everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something pulled tight in my chest as he helped me sit up, his hand warm against my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re getting divorced,&#34; I reminded him, hating how small my voice sounded. &#34;You don&#39;t need to pretend to care anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, but his touch remained gentle as he handed me the pills. &#34;Close your eyes and rest. You&#39;re burning up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was too exhausted to argue, my head pounding with each heartbeat. The cool pillow welcomed me back as Sean adjusted the blankets, his cologne wrapping around me like a familiar comfort I shouldn&#39;t allow myself to feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleep came in fits and starts, punctuated by fever dreams of graduation nights and yacht parties, of moments I&#39;d lost before I&#39;d ever had them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then suddenly, I was jolting awake from a nightmare I couldn&#39;t quite remember, Sean&#39;s name escaping my lips before I could stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bedroom was empty, the silence broken only by the distant hum of the city below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was somewhere in our home tonight - the thought sent a fresh wave of pain through my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Sean with her now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image of them together, making love, invaded my mind before I could stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tear slipped down my cheek, disappearing into the pillow before I could brush it away.</p>
