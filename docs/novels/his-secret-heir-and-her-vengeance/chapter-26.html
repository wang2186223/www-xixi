                <p>Angela POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could reply, I looked up to find Sean standing before me, his expression unfathomable. He stepped closer and said quietly, &#34;We need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at him and set down my teacup. &#34;Go ahead,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This has to stop,&#34; he said, gripping my wrist. &#34;Whatever issues we have, we can&#39;t let them affect grandmother right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled my hand free, careful to keep my voice low. &#34;I&#39;m well aware of our responsibilities, Sean. I&#39;ve been managing appearances for two years now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened. &#34;Then why are you suddenly acting like my touch burns you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe because I&#39;m tired of pretending.&#34; The words slipped out before I could stop them. &#34;Tired of playing the perfect wife while you spend your nights with-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t.&#34; His voice carried a warning edge. &#34;Not here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if to prove his point, a nurse walked past, her curious glance lingering on our intimate positioning. Sean immediately shifted closer, one arm sliding around my waist in a practiced display of affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Smile,&#34; he whispered against my hair. &#34;We have an audience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced my lips to curve upward, even as my body tensed against his chest. This close, I could feel the steady beat of his heart, could smell the faint traces of expensive whiskey still clinging to his clothes from the night before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled away from his embrace, saying, &#34;Grandmother is waiting for her tea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up the teacup and headed toward the garden to find her. Sean followed, his arm wrapping firmly around my waist as we walked side by side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elizabeth beamed at the sight of us together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two remind me so much of my younger days with your grandfather,&#34; she said wistfully. &#34;Such a handsome couple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes sparkled with joy, but before she could continue, a nurse came over to inform us it was time for Elizabeth&#39;s routine checkup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We waited outside the examination room, Sean still holding me close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You went to the club last night,&#34; he said suddenly, his fingers tightening fractionally on my hip. &#34;Evan told me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel the temperature rising between us, and I tried to pull away from his embrace, but his grip remained firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t go last night,&#34; I said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lying,&#34; Sean&#39;s voice hardened. &#34;Evan called you, and he saw you there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Evan did call me,&#34; I admitted. &#34;But I went to bed early last night. He must have seen someone else. Besides, taking care of you is Christina&#39;s responsibility now, not mine. Why would I interfere between you two?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally released me from his grip, saying arrogantly, &#34;Evan called you on his own initiative. I never asked him to call you. And I certainly wasn&#39;t expecting you to come pick me up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as our argument was escalating, Dr. Carter opened the examination room door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. and Mrs. Shaw?&#34; His expression was carefully neutral. &#34;Could I have a moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s arm stayed around my waist as we followed the doctor to a private waiting area. The room was decorated like an upscale living room, with plush leather chairs and tasteful artwork, but nothing could completely disguise its clinical purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elizabeth&#39;s latest tests show some concerning developments,&#34; Dr. Carter began. &#34;Nothing immediately dangerous, but I believe we should move up the surgery schedule.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much sooner?&#34; Sean&#39;s voice remained steady, but I felt the tension in his body increase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to move the surgery up by a week.&#34; Dr. Carter glanced between us. &#34;I know it&#39;s short notice, but waiting carries unnecessary risks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A week earlier than planned. The timeline we&#39;d been using to measure our marriage&#39;s remaining days had suddenly shortened dramatically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does she know yet?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought it best to discuss it with you first.&#34; Dr. Carter&#39;s smile was sympathetic. &#34;Elizabeth tends to handle such news better when it comes from family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to tell her together,&#34; Sean said finally. &#34;Present a united front.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela...&#34; He ran a hand through his hair, a rare display of frustration. &#34;This isn&#39;t about playing parts. Grandmother needs both of us right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; My voice softened despite myself. &#34;I won&#39;t let her down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand found mine, fingers intertwining with practiced ease. For a moment, I allowed myself to remember how natural this used to feel - the simple comfort of his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Truce?&#34; he offered quietly. &#34;Just until she&#39;s recovered?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Truce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we returned to Elizabeth&#39;s room, she was sitting up in bed, her sharp eyes taking in our joined hands with obvious approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There you are, my dears.&#34; Her smile could still light up a room. &#34;Such perfect harmony. I always knew you two were meant for each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, I&#39;ve been thinking about the future lately. About legacy, and what truly matters.&#34; Her gaze moved between us, unusually serious. &#34;Promise me something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything,&#34; Sean said immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise me you&#39;ll take care of each other. No matter what happens with this surgery.&#34; Her voice carried the weight of years of observation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Life is too short for pride to stand in the way of love.&#34;</p>
