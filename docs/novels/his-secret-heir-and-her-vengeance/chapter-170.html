                <p>Angela POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For a woman, you punch me?&#34; William steadied himself against the wall, nostrils flaring. &#34;I&#39;ll fight you too, Sean! This is insane!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean gently shifted me behind him, placing himself between William and me in a gesture that was unmistakably protective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try it,&#34; Sean challenged, his tone still unnervingly calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William lunged forward, fist drawn back. Sean caught his punch mid-air with disturbing ease, fingers closing around William&#39;s knuckles like a vise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t lose your mind in my home,&#34; Sean warned softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s losing their mind?&#34; William spat back. &#34;You&#39;re the one who&#39;s lost it! How can you face Christina after this? What kind of man are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s other hand shot up unexpectedly, connecting with Sean&#39;s jaw. I gasped involuntarily, my heart racing as I watched the two men square off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sean, please stop!&#34; Christina&#39;s voice cut through the tension as she stepped forward, eyes glistening with tears. She grabbed William&#39;s wrist desperately. &#34;William, don&#39;t hit him! Please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her knuckles whitened as she clung to William&#39;s arm. &#34;Both of you, just talk it out. Don&#39;t fight because of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I observed the scene with quiet detachment, noting the hidden currents beneath her words. This fight isn&#39;t really about you, Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What struck me most was the way Christina looked at Sean-her eyes brimming with expectation and dependency, her entire body angled toward him even as she restrained William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evan stepped forward, his practical nature asserting itself. &#34;Gentlemen, this is beneath both of you. We&#39;ve all been friends for years. Let&#39;s talk like adults.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He threw the first punch!&#34; William protested, yanking against Christina&#39;s restraining grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would he have done that if you hadn&#39;t grabbed Angela&#39;s shoulder?&#34; Evan countered, raising an eyebrow. &#34;You instigated this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just grabbed her shoulder,&#34; William huffed indignantly. &#34;I didn&#39;t hit her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evan shook his head in disapproval. &#34;That&#39;s hardly gentlemanly behavior, William.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s so special about Angela Wilson anyway?&#34; William sneered, his gaze raking over me dismissively. &#34;Is she untouchable now? Too precious to even be touched?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too precious for you to touch,&#34; Sean replied, his voice dropping an octave. The possessiveness in his tone sent an involuntary shiver down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evan raised both hands, his patience visibly thinning. &#34;Enough! Are you two planning to continue this ridiculous display all night? Because if so, I&#39;m leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evan raised both hands, visibly frustrated. &#34;Enough of this ridiculous display!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched the tense standoff, deliberately staying silent. This wasn&#39;t my fight, and I had no desire to mediate between Sean and his so-called friends. My only concern was retrieving my children and leaving this toxic situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shaw uncle, are you fighting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The small voice sent ice through my veins. I turned to see Aria standing in the doorway, her small fingers clutching Sean&#39;s suit jacket. Her dark curls framed her innocent face as she looked up at the adults with wide, curious eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone&#39;s attention immediately shifted to her. I watched as they took in her features, the striking resemblance to Sean unmistakable even to strangers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved quickly, pulling Aria to my side. &#34;Aria, don&#39;t get involved in adult matters,&#34; I said firmly, trying to mask my panic. &#34;Where&#39;s your brother? Go get him. We&#39;re leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan appeared in the doorway, moving to stand beside us. With his serious expression and unmistakable green eyes, his resemblance to Sean was impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched Christina&#39;s face drain of color as her gaze darted between Ethan and Sean. The truth was written plainly on her face-she recognized immediately whose children these were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s entire demeanor transformed the moment Aria appeared. He immediately released William and stepped back, all aggression vanishing from his posture. I noticed how he positioned himself to subtly include me and the children within his protective radius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell, Sean?&#34; William exploded, looking from the children to Sean and back. &#34;Are these your kids? You&#39;ve had children with Angela all this time? What about Christina? What has she been to you all these years? Does she deserve to be strung along like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hallway fell silent as everyone awaited Sean&#39;s response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William spun toward Christina. &#34;What is he talking about? What did you two discuss that I don&#39;t know about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s face had gone ashen, her lips pressed into a thin line as she seemed unable to formulate a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I need to spell it out for everyone?&#34; Sean asked, his voice glacial as Christina remained mute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. Since you all want to know, I&#39;ll say it plainly. Five years ago, when Angela left, you came to my room in the middle of the night pretending to be her. Later, you spread rumors about our engagement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve kept quiet about these things to protect you, Christina, but I&#39;ve repeatedly told you that I will never marry you. I&#39;m saying it again now, in front of everyone, so there will be no more misunderstandings. I will never marry you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at Christina in disbelief. The calculated deception Sean described was shocking even to me, who had experienced her manipulations firsthand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s expression morphed from anger to confusion to shock as he processed Sean&#39;s words. Christina couldn&#39;t meet anyone&#39;s eyes, her silence confirming everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this true?&#34; William asked her, his voice suddenly quiet. &#34;Did you really do those things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s continued silence was answer enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evan shook his head slowly. &#34;Everyone heard about that engagement party. All this time, I thought Sean had abandoned you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uncomfortable silence descended as everyone absorbed this unexpected revelation. Sean&#39;s eyes found mine again, a hint of apology in them for airing all this dirty laundry in front of me and the children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just thought...&#34; Christina finally spoke, her voice breaking, &#34;that even if you didn&#39;t love me at first, with time you would see that I was the one who truly loved you, that you would eventually change your mind...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s face displayed a kaleidoscope of emotions before settling back on indignation. &#34;What&#39;s so wrong with that? She only did those things because she loves you so much! At least she didn&#39;t abandon you like Angela did!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words stung, but I remained silent. Sean&#39;s expression hardened further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never promised Christina anything,&#34; Sean stated firmly. &#34;I never agreed to that supposed engagement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all clear now,&#34; Evan said, looking at Christina. &#34;You need to let this go, Christina. It&#39;s over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sean,&#34; Christina attempted one last plea, &#34;that day on the yacht, if it weren&#39;t for me, you would have-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will repay the life debt,&#34; Sean interrupted coldly, &#34;but not with marriage. I&#39;ve been perfectly clear about that.&#34;</p>
