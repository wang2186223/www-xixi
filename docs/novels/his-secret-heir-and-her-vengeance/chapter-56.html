                <p>Angela POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s smirk deepened as he watched me, lounging back into the plush leather of the VIP suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes held that familiar entitled gleam I&#39;d seen too many times in men who confused wealth with worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come now, Angela,&#34; he drawled, gesturing to one of his friends to pour more champagne. &#34;Why so serious? We&#39;re all friends here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my stance firm, one hand protectively near Emily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve made myself clear, Luca. This isn&#39;t an appropriate venue for business discussions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of Luca&#39;s friends-a tall man with slicked-back hair and an expensive but tasteless suit-sidled closer to Emily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey beautiful, how about a drink?&#34; He held out a glass of champagne, his smile predatory. &#34;A pretty thing like you shouldn&#39;t just stand there all stiff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily shifted uncomfortably, pressing closer to me. &#34;No, thank you,&#34; she said firmly, but I could hear the tremor in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave her alone,&#34; I snapped, my patience wearing thin. &#34;She&#39;s here in a professional capacity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another of Luca&#39;s entourage laughed, the sound crude and mocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Professional? Come on, sweetheart. We all know why pretty girls like you two really come to places like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca raised his hand, silencing his friends with a lazy gesture. He stood, walking toward me with exaggerated casualness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, Angela, I&#39;ve been hearing interesting things about you and Sean.&#34; His voice dropped lower, meant for my ears alone. &#34;Word is, he&#39;s getting ready to throw you aside. Christina&#39;s quite the upgrade, isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my jaw tighten but kept my expression neutral. &#34;My marriage is none of your concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, taking another step closer. &#34;Why keep playing the loyal wife? Everyone knows you&#39;re just hanging on by a thread. When Sean dumps you, what will you have left? A failed family name? A bankrupted legacy?&#34; His eyes raked over me appreciatively. &#34;But you could do better. Someone like me could give you everything you need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s lips curled into a sneer. &#34;Stop acting so high and mighty, Angela. Everyone knows you only married Sean for his money. How are you any different from these hookers?&#34; He gestured dismissively at the women in the room. &#34;At least they&#39;re honest about what they&#39;re selling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes flashed dangerously. &#34;And that&#39;s exactly why you&#39;ll always be nothing but a trust fund playboy who&#39;s never earned a dollar on his own,&#34; I shot back, my voice dripping with disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me, Luca, besides spending daddy&#39;s money, what exactly can you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch your mouth, Angela. You&#39;re not in a position to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To what?&#34; I cut in, my voice ice-cold. &#34;To point out that you&#39;re nothing but a parasite? Unlike you, I can actually earn my own living. Take away your father&#39;s connections, and what are you? Just another mediocre man with an inflated ego.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage flashed across his features. Before I could step back, he grabbed my arm, yanking me closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think Sean will protect you? He doesn&#39;t give a damn about you anymore. I could take you right here, and he wouldn&#39;t lift a finger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed, harsh and ugly. &#34;What are you going to do? Tell Sean? Go ahead. Everyone knows he&#39;s too busy with Christina to care about his soon-to-be ex-wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca leaned in closer. &#34;Why don&#39;t you become my mistress instead?&#34; His voice dropped to a husky whisper. &#34;I can make sure you maintain this luxurious lifestyle after your divorce. Remember that island party five years ago? I liked you from the moment I saw you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory suddenly flooded back-that resort party where I&#39;d first encountered Luca. We&#39;d had a heated argument that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered it clearly now: he&#39;d made crude comments about my dress, suggesting I was trying to seduce men with my &#34;provocative&#34; outfit. He&#39;d propositioned me for a one-night stand, treating me like some easy conquest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt bile rise in my throat as his face loomed closer, alcohol heavy on his breath. I tried to pull away, but his grip tightened painfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of me,&#34; I warned, &#34;or you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela!&#34; Emily&#39;s voice suddenly cut through the tension. She rushed forward, trying to pull Luca&#39;s arm away from me. &#34;Stop it! Let her go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two of Luca&#39;s friends pounced on Emily, their hands rough and greedy. One pinned her slender neck in a bruising grip, his fingers digging into her soft skin, while the other shoved his hand under her blouse, groping her curves with shameless hunger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at this tasty little treat,&#34; one of them growled, yanking her closer, his voice dripping with lust. &#34;Such a loyal assistant, huh? Time to show this sweet thing what happens when good girls step out of line.&#34; He pressed himself against her, his bulge obvious through his pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, now,&#34; the other purred, his hot breath tickling her ear as he dragged his tongue slowly up her cheek, leaving a wet trail across her flushed face. &#34;Don&#39;t scare her too much. She&#39;s just a pretty little pet trying to please her boss-let&#39;s break her in nice and slow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34; I struggled harder against Luca&#39;s grip, watching helplessly as tears welled up in Emily&#39;s eyes. &#34;Leave her alone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca just laughed, clearly enjoying the scene. &#34;See what happens when you try to act above your station? Now your precious assistant has to suffer the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as one of the men started to force a glass of champagne to Emily&#39;s lips, the door burst open with a thunderous crash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A massive figure filled the doorway-broad-shouldered and intimidating, like a Marine stepped straight out of a recruitment poster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dim light, I could barely make out his features, but his presence commanded immediate attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything happened in a blur after that. Luca was suddenly on the ground, clutching his jaw. His friends scattered like cockroaches, a few trying to fight back only to be efficiently dispatched by the newcomer&#39;s precise, powerful movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Shaw,&#34; the man&#39;s deep voice cut through the chaos, &#34;please come with me. Your car is waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved with military precision, creating a safe path through the now-chaos of the VIP room. I grabbed Emily&#39;s hand, pulling her along as we followed our unexpected rescuer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; I asked Emily as we hurried toward the exit, my heart still racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, though her face was pale. &#34;Yes, thanks to you. And... whoever that is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we reached the corridor, I turned to our mysterious savior. &#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man remained silent, his expression unreadable beneath the dim lights. Finally, he spoke, his voice deep and professional. &#34;My employer sent me to assist you, Mrs. Shaw. He would like to meet with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More security personnel emerged from the shadows, surrounding us in a protective formation. Despite their intimidating presence, I felt oddly calm. These men had just saved us from Luca-surely I could trust them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded slowly. &#34;Alright, take me to your employer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as Emily and I started to move forward together, the large man held out his arm, blocking Emily&#39;s path. &#34;I apologize, Miss Miller, but my employer wishes to speak with Mrs. Shaw alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily&#39;s eyes widened with concern. &#34;But Angela-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay, Emily,&#34; I reassured her, though uncertainty flickered through me. &#34;Have someone from the office pick you up. I&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
