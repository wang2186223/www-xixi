                <p>My heart pounded as we stood outside Christopher&#39;s luxury apartment building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like an eternity, the door swung open. David, Christopher&#39;s personal assistant, greeted me with a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Wilson.&#34; His tone was welcoming and familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;David, is Christopher inside?&#34; I asked, unable to mask the urgency in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Blake is in the-&#34; David&#39;s words died on his lips as his gaze shifted behind me, registering Sean&#39;s imposing presence. The friendly smile vanished instantly, replaced by a guarded expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely noticed the change, my mind entirely focused on finding my children. I pushed past David into the foyer, moving quickly across the marble floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean moved to follow, but David instinctively stepped forward to block his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, I&#39;m not sure if-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s emerald eyes locked with David&#39;s, the intensity of his gaze so palpable it seemed to physically push the other man back. Without a single word spoken, David retreated, allowing Sean to enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The subtle aroma of polished wood and luxury enveloped me as I moved through the apartment. Then I heard it-Aria&#39;s distinctive laughter, bright and carefree, followed by a man&#39;s gentle voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed the sounds through the open glass doors leading to the terrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christopher sat in a plush outdoor chair, Aria perched on a cushioned bench beside him, her small face lit with delight. Ethan sat across from them, his posture characteristically more reserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The terrace table was adorned with an assortment of gourmet pastries and several expensive-looking toys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan noticed me first, his watchful eyes widening slightly. &#34;Aria, Mama&#39;s here,&#34; he said, his voice measured and calm as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aria&#39;s head whipped around, her curls bouncing as she spotted me. &#34;Mama!&#34; she squealed, leaping from her seat and racing toward me with outstretched arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crouched down, enveloping her in a tight embrace, breathing in her familiar scent mingled with chocolate. Relief crashed over me in waves as I held her solid, warm body against mine. Ethan approached more slowly, but I reached out an arm to include him in our embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela, you&#39;re here,&#34; Christopher said, his voice gentle and untroubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I examined Aria&#39;s face, noting the chocolate smeared around her mouth. &#34;Look at you,&#34; I said, attempting a light tone despite my still-pounding heart. &#34;Eating like this, are you a little piggy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aria is not a little piggy!&#34; she protested indignantly. &#34;Piggies aren&#39;t pretty!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christopher approached us, his movements fluid and graceful as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he began, his tone genuinely apologetic. &#34;I was passing by the school today and missed Ethan and Aria, so I decided to pick them up for a little while. I forgot to let you know. I hope I didn&#39;t cause you any trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could respond, Sean&#39;s voice cut through the air from behind me. &#34;Not trouble-just hours of frantic searching.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot Sean a warning glance, silently pleading with him not to escalate the situation in front of the children. Christopher&#39;s expression flickered momentarily-a brief shadow crossing his features-before his composed mask returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were searching for that long?&#34; Christopher&#39;s voice remained level. &#34;I apologize for my oversight. It was truly careless of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; I interjected quickly. &#34;These things happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christopher&#39;s gaze lingered on me before shifting to Sean, then back to me. &#34;You haven&#39;t had dinner yet, have you? Why not stay and join us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need,&#34; I replied, forcing a smile. &#34;I&#39;ve already arranged food at home. Everything would go to waste if we stayed. Perhaps another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well,&#34; Christopher nodded. &#34;Let me have David drive you home, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That won&#39;t be necessary,&#34; Sean interjected immediately, his tone brooking no argument. &#34;I&#39;ll take them myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christopher&#39;s eyes hardened as they met Sean&#39;s. &#34;I wasn&#39;t asking you. I was asking Angela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension between them was palpable, like static electricity charging the air. I stepped forward, placing myself subtly between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really, it&#39;s fine,&#34; I assured Christopher. &#34;I can manage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christopher conceded with a graceful nod. &#34;If you&#39;re sure. Be safe, and call me if you need anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34; I promised, already gathering the children&#39;s belongings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we prepared to leave, Christopher disappeared briefly, returning with two elegant gift bags. &#34;These are for Aria and Ethan,&#34; he said, extending them toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I-&#34; I began to refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; he insisted gently. &#34;Aria has already accepted hers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at my daughter, who was indeed clutching a small stuffed unicorn that hadn&#39;t been in her possession earlier. With a resigned nod, I accepted the bags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I took Aria&#39;s hand, preparing to leave, Sean unexpectedly bent down and scooped Ethan into his arms. The boy looked startled but didn&#39;t protest. For a moment, something passed between them-a look, a feeling-that made my heart constrict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christopher stood motionless on his terrace as we left, his expression carefully blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I looked back at his solitary figure watching us leave, a storm of emotions churned within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger rose first - how could he take my children without telling me? - followed quickly by guilt for how harshly I&#39;d treated him last week. Yet beneath these feelings lurked something else: fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Christopher, who had always been so dependable, could do this... would it happen again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would someone else try to take my children next time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought sent a chill through me as Sean and I carried my children away.</p>
