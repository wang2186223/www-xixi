                <p>Sean POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I walked back into the hospital room, I was surprised to hear Grandma laughing-really laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela had clearly told her some joke. But instead of feeling relieved, a tight knot formed in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Angela and Grandma bonded, the more unsettled I felt. It was as if the closer they grew, the harder it would be to tell Grandma about the divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if she took it badly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if it made her so upset that she collapsed again, like before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made me wince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stood there in the doorway, lost in my worries, Grandma noticed me. Her face brightened when she saw me. &#34;Ah, there you are,&#34; she said, her voice soft with affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you feeling, Grandma?&#34; I asked, walking over to her bedside. &#34;Are you hungry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma waved me off with a smile. &#34;Angela already made sure I&#39;m taken care of. She&#39;s having mushroom soup sent up.&#34; She patted Angela&#39;s hand, clearly proud of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as I can see you both, I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, the nurse brought in the soup. Angela immediately took charge, gently feeding Grandma herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something about the way Angela cared for Grandma that made her seem like she was already a part of the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Grandma finished her soup, she sat back against her pillows, her gaze softening. &#34;You two should head back to the office now,&#34; she said, sounding almost guilty. &#34;I&#39;ve wasted your whole day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, how could spending time with you be a waste?&#34; I said. My frustration with the situation was starting to show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela smiled at me, her tone calm. &#34;We&#39;re happy to be here with you, not just because it&#39;s our responsibility. You need to get better so you can be ready for the surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma shook her head. &#34;I&#39;m getting old, dear. Whether I have the surgery or not it doesn&#39;t really matter. I don&#39;t want to be a burden to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, don&#39;t say that,&#34; I said quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor had warned me that if she didn&#39;t have the surgery, she might not make it another two years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to talk about this. You don&#39;t have much time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela, sensing my anxiety, spoke to Grandma gently.&#34;What if we bring you home to stay with us? It&#39;ll be better than here. You&#39;ll be more comfortable, and we&#39;ll be able to take care of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, your house isn&#39;t like a nursing home. There&#39;s no one there to look after me the way they do here.&#34;Grandma hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft sigh, she lay back down, clearly exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to pressure her anymore. She needed rest, and I wasn&#39;t about to disturb that. I motioned for Angela to follow me out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as we stepped into the hallway, Angela&#39;s frustration poured out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can we leave her here alone like this? Can&#39;t you see how much stress she&#39;s under about the surgery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she doesn&#39;t want to come back with us, Angela. She needs rest. We can&#39;t push her.&#34;I rubbed my temples, trying to stay calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We shouldn&#39;t have left her at the nursing home yesterday. And we shouldn&#39;t have gone to handle the divorce paperwork this morning. We should&#39;ve been here earlier. This is all my fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela&#39;s voice cracked with guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I realized then that Angela wasn&#39;t angry with me-she was blaming herself. Her guilt was weighing her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand,&#34; I said softly. &#34;I&#39;ll talk to her. I&#39;ll convince her to come home with us tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arranged for Grandma&#39;s things to be packed up and for the housemaid to prepare her room. I even bought a bouquet of her favorite tulips. An hour later, Angela and I returned to Grandma&#39;s room, where she looked up, clearly surprised to see us again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you two doing here?&#34; she asked, a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had the driver bring your things home,&#34; I said. &#34;You&#39;re coming with us tonight. No arguments.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t ask for my permission!&#34; Grandma grumbled, though her eyes were full of amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just listen to Sean. You won&#39;t be staying here tonight anyway.&#34; Angela added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma hesitated but allowed us to help her out of bed. She grumbled a bit more, but the smile on her face said it all-she was happy we were there. As much as she pretended to resist, I could see that she was relieved to have us by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela had been right all along. Grandma may have seemed independent, but deep down, she was scared of the surgery and longed to be with family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the drive home, the mood lightened. Angela and Grandma chatted and laughed, their conversation easy and full of warmth. For the first time all day, I felt a sense of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the drive, my phone rang. It was my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked about Grandma&#39;s surgery. Grandma answered the phone with a calm, reassuring tone, telling my mother that the surgery would be delayed and that she shouldn&#39;t worry about rushing back to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With Sean and Angela here, I&#39;m in good hands,&#34; Grandma said, her voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we&#39;ll come tomorrow and have dinner with you,&#34; my mother said on the other end, her tone relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that made me feel lighter. We hadn&#39;t had a family gathering in so long, and knowing that one was coming made Grandma even happier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget the doctor&#39;s orders-no alcohol,&#34; Angela teased Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma shot her a playful look. &#34;You little thing, you&#39;re even more nagging than Sean!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but laugh. It felt good to finally relax, to let go of the tension I&#39;d been carrying all day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we pulled into the driveway, though, I noticed something that made my heart skip a beat. A familiar figure stood near the entrance, speaking to the building security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was dressed in a white dress, and as the security guard gestured toward us, she turned and looked in our direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The headlights of the car illuminated her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze for a second, my heart tightening. Why was she here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s that woman?&#34; Grandma asked, her voice curious. &#34;She looks... familiar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what to say. All I could do was watch as Christina stood there, looking right at us.</p>
