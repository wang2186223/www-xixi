                <p>Angela POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela, you&#39;re finally back!&#34; Olivia exclaimed as we entered her apartment. &#34;I haven&#39;t seen you all day. Was it a special date with Christopher?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christopher smiled slightly. &#34;If you want to call it a date, I wouldn&#39;t object.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt heat rising to my cheeks. &#34;We were looking at schools for Aria and Ethan,&#34; I explained, setting down my purse on the console table. &#34;Nothing romantic about registration paperwork.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guilt flashed across Olivia&#39;s face. &#34;Oh my God, I completely forgot about that! I&#39;m so sorry, Angela. I should have gone with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; I assured her, helping Aria with her coat. &#34;Christopher knows all the best private schools in the city.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hung our coats in the closet, then turned to Olivia with practiced casualness. &#34;By the way, you called me twice around noon. Was there something urgent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as Olivia&#39;s expression flickered, her fingers suddenly twisting together. &#34;No... nothing special. Just wondering when you&#39;d be back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My intuition immediately flared-she was hiding something. But I simply nodded, letting the matter drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aria, Ethan, go change into your house clothes,&#34; I instructed, watching the twins disappear down the hallway before turning back to the adults in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christopher leaned against the kitchen counter, his posture relaxed but his eyes sharp. &#34;So, Olivia, how was your evening at that bar last night? Did you find what you were looking for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia&#39;s head snapped toward him, then toward me, her eyes narrowing. &#34;You told him? About the bar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was concerned,&#34; I said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela,&#34; Olivia&#39;s voice took on a hard edge I&#39;d rarely heard before. &#34;We agreed that even while living together, we&#39;d maintain our independence and not interfere in each other&#39;s personal lives. Why would you tell Christopher about me going to a bar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was merely concerned for your safety,&#34; Christopher interjected smoothly, his voice gentle but firm. &#34;Bars these days can be unpredictable environments, especially for a beautiful single woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched Olivia&#39;s expression soften slightly at the compliment, though resentment still lingered in her eyes. This concerned me even more-whenever anything related to Sean came up, Olivia seemed unable to control her emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her encounter with him at the hotel last night, her infatuation with him appeared to have deepened significantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later in the kitchen, as we prepared dinner, I carefully sliced vegetables while Olivia seasoned the fish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,&#34; I ventured, &#34;did you manage to get that green-eyed man&#39;s contact information?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did!&#34; Olivia exclaimed excitedly. &#34;He seems cold and distant, but I&#39;m sure I can win him over!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia&#39;s knife paused mid-chop. &#34;Angela,&#34; she said, not looking up from the cutting board, &#34;you spent the whole day with Christopher, didn&#39;t you? He&#39;s been so good to you, even arranging accommodation in the city. If I insist on you staying here, would that interfere with your relationship development?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up at Olivia, feeling a wave of disappointment wash over me. Despite my outward composure, I could feel something shift between us-a subtle fracture in our friendship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dinner was a quiet affair. The tension around the table was palpable; even the twins seemed to sense it, eating quietly without their usual chatter and playfulness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we finished our meal, I looked at my children with a gentle smile. &#34;Ethan, Aria, you both behaved very well tonight. Why don&#39;t you go rest in your room for a bit, then pack your things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of my eye, I saw Olivia&#39;s face drain of color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll be moving to a hotel downtown tonight,&#34; I explained calmly, my voice betraying none of the turmoil I felt inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The twins exchanged a quick glance before quietly excusing themselves from the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they left, I deliberately took my time finishing the last bite of seafood salad, savoring the delicate flavors while gathering my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela, I&#39;m sorry,&#34; Olivia whispered, her voice small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew Olivia wasn&#39;t truly concerned about my relationship with Christopher. She simply didn&#39;t want me staying here to &#34;interfere&#34; with her pursuit of Sean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In my room, I methodically packed our belongings while booking a suite at The Four Seasons on my phone. A soft knock interrupted my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; I called, zipping my suitcase closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan appeared in the doorway, his small frame silhouetted against the hallway light. &#34;I&#39;ve packed everything, Mama,&#34; he reported solemnly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Aria?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s ready too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wheeled my suitcase into the hallway, where Olivia stood waiting, her expression a complex mixture of regret and defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you really leaving?&#34; she asked, arms crossed protectively over her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to be closer to the school for tomorrow&#39;s enrollment,&#34; I explained, the excuse sounding hollow even to my own ears. &#34;It&#39;s more convenient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me drive you, at least,&#34; she offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, but I&#39;ve already called a car.&#34; I turned to my son. &#34;Ethan, please go get your sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia&#39;s eyes followed the boy as he disappeared into the guest bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before we go,&#34; I said quietly, turning back to my friend of many years, &#34;I have something to say. You may not want to hear this, Olivia, but as your friend, I need to warn you-before falling for someone, make sure he&#39;s actually single. Make sure he doesn&#39;t have a girlfriend or fiancée. Don&#39;t end up hurting yourself.&#34; I picked up my handbag. &#34;That&#39;s all I can say. We should go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t wait for her response. The twins emerged from their room, Aria chattering excitedly about bringing Olivia chocolates from the hotel, both children seemingly oblivious to the tension between the adults.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the apartment door closed behind us, worry gnawed at my heart. I knew I couldn&#39;t stop Olivia&#39;s infatuation with Sean-those green eyes had cast a spell too powerful to break with mere words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking toward the elevator, I wondered if I should have told her the truth-that the mysterious green-eyed man was the father of my children, the husband I had deliberately left behind five years ago.</p>
