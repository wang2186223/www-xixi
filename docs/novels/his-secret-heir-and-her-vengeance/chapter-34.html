                <p>I met Nathan&#39;s gaze, doing my best to stay calm despite the unease creeping in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The exact time hasn&#39;t been set yet, but it&#39;ll be soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows furrowed even more at my response, his lips pressed into a thin line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the gears turning in his mind, calculating, analyzing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you before, you can always consult with me before making any big decisions,&#34; Nathan said, his tone more serious now, but there was an edge of concern beneath it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged, forcing a smile. &#34;I only decided a couple of days ago. It&#39;s not really a big deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan&#39;s gaze softened, but only for a moment. He nodded, though his thoughts seemed to be elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nathan, what&#39;s going on in that head of yours?&#34; I asked, unable to bear the silence any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked, as if snapping out of a trance, and looked at me, a flicker of sadness in his eyes that I hadn&#39;t seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; He hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not thinking about resigning, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan had come to work at Sean&#39;s company because of me, and I knew he&#39;d follow my lead in everything-even quitting if I decided to leave. The thought of him leaving without a second thought hit me hard, a mix of protectiveness and guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of answering, Nathan raised an eyebrow and gave me a half-smile-one that didn&#39;t reach his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m thinking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; I said, &#34;but don&#39;t forget about your own situation. Are you really planning to leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;ve already made up my mind.&#34; I nodded, trying to keep my tone light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela, I&#39;m not criticizing you,&#34; Nathan said, his voice softer but still laced with frustration. &#34;But Christina&#39;s back, and you&#39;re just going to walk away? Is it really that easy to push you around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words stung, but I didn&#39;t flinch. I knew it wasn&#39;t just about Christina-it was about me, about how Nathan saw me giving up, how he thought I was weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause, and his voice dropped lower, his brow furrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela, you weren&#39;t always like this. Why is it when it comes to Sean, you just... give up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered my eyes, feeling a lump form in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it had been anyone else, I might&#39;ve fought for them. But Sean didn&#39;t love me-not the way I needed him to. And I couldn&#39;t keep holding on to something that would never be mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t come here to talk about Christina, did you?&#34; I asked, trying to shift the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan glanced down at the folder in his hands, clearing his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, the project Sean had us working on before your vacation? I&#39;ve already handled it. Take a look.&#34; He placed the folder gently on my desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked it up, impressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You finished it a week ahead of schedule?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was easy.&#34; Nathan grinned, his usual cocky smirk back in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pride was contagious, and I couldn&#39;t help but smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The afternoon wore on, and soon the warm rays of the setting sun filtered through the office window, casting a golden glow on Nathan&#39;s hair. Time had passed faster than I realized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To reward you, I&#39;ll take you out to dinner tonight.&#34; Without thinking, I ruffled his hair, a playful gesture that always felt natural between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, Nathan didn&#39;t just let it happen. In one smooth motion, he grabbed my hand, his grip firm, and lifted his head, closing the space between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were darker than I&#39;d ever seen, and his voice dropped low as he whispered, &#34;Stop treating me like a kid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something in his gaze-something unspoken-that made my heart skip a beat. I quickly pulled my hand back, stepping away, suddenly aware of the distance that had grown between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To me, you&#39;ll always be like a little brother,&#34; I said, laughing to hide the awkwardness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan didn&#39;t answer, his eyes lingering on me as if he was considering the space I&#39;d put between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my laptop with a soft click and pushed it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go. I know a great restaurant. You&#39;ll love it,&#34; I said, offering him a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan glanced at me, and we both made our way toward the door. The office was quiet now, with most of the employees having left for the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as we stepped out of the office, we came face to face with Christina and Sean, who were walking toward us. The air shifted instantly, thick with unspoken tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s gaze flicked briefly to mine, and then, almost instinctively, his eyes landed on Nathan. His expression hardened, and I felt an odd chill pass between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina, always ready to stir the pot, didn&#39;t miss her chance. &#34;Angela,&#34; she said, her voice dripping with sweetness, &#34;It looks like you and Nathan are pretty close. I hear you&#39;ve known each other for years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer immediately, and I could feel Nathan&#39;s stance shift beside me-his posture stiffening just slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina wasn&#39;t done. &#34;I also heard that before your family went bankrupt, Nathan worked at your family&#39;s bank. Your father even planned to arrange your engagement, didn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could respond, Nathan spoke up, his voice sharp with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know so much about Angela&#39;s family? Did you have someone dig into her past?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, taking a small step forward, he added, &#34;And by the way, Angela and I are colleagues. We talk about work. But you, Christina-what&#39;s your excuse? Why are you always hanging around someone else&#39;s husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina went silent, her face flushing with anger, but she quickly turned to Sean, hoping he&#39;d step in to defend her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sean didn&#39;t move. Didn&#39;t speak. He just stood there, his face an unreadable mask, his gaze icy. Finally, he turned to me, as though Christina had disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The workday&#39;s over. Let&#39;s go home together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We already have plans for dinner,&#34; I said, my voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s expression darkened even further, his jaw tightening as if my words had struck a nerve. I couldn&#39;t understand why he was so upset. I was just having dinner with Nathan-there was no reason for this hostility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is this what they call possessiveness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Sean didn&#39;t have feelings for me, was I not allowed to be around another man as long as I was still his wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t wait for Sean to say anything else. I wasn&#39;t asking for permission anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing Nathan&#39;s arm with finality, I smiled and said,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go! The restaurant is really popular, and if we&#39;re late, we won&#39;t get a seat.&#34;</p>
