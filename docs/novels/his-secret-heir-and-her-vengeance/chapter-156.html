                <p>Angela POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands still trembled slightly as I guided the twins through our apartment door, the shocking revelation weighing heavily on my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we have hot chocolate, Mama?&#34; Aria asked, skipping ahead to the kitchen while I set my purse down on the entryway table and hung our coats in the closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, sweetheart,&#34; I replied, taking a deep breath to compose myself. I couldn&#39;t let the children see how shaken I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed them into the kitchen, where Aria was already climbing onto her favorite stool. Ethan stood quietly by the counter, his observant gaze studying my face with unusual intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mama, are you okay?&#34; Ethan asked, his gaze unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My smile faltered momentarily. &#34;I&#39;m fine, sweetheart. Just thinking about some work things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been quiet since we left the mall playground,&#34; he persisted, showing that perceptiveness that sometimes caught me off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aria jumped down from her stool and tugged at my hand. &#34;Come see what I drew today! I put it in my backpack. It&#39;s a unicorn with rainbow wings!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I helped her retrieve her artwork, I noticed Ethan still watching me, clearly unconvinced by my casual dismissal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mama, you look worried,&#34; Aria remarked suddenly, her small face turning serious. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t think about work now. It&#39;s after-work time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed softly, grateful for my daughter&#39;s simple wisdom. &#34;You&#39;re right, darling.&#34; I stroked her dark curls, then glanced between both children. &#34;Actually, I wanted to ask you both something. Did Mr. Night visit your school during lunch today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The twins exchanged glances before Ethan shook his head. &#34;No, not today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He came yesterday and the day before,&#34; Aria added helpfully. &#34;He probably had work today. But his assistant came and brought us special lunches!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My suspicions solidified instantly. Was Sean&#39;s absence from the school because of our argument in the parking garage last night? The timing seemed to fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Night&#39;s so nice,&#34; Aria continued, oblivious to my churning thoughts. &#34;I asked him if he was married or had a girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My attention snapped fully to my daughter. &#34;You asked him what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aria grinned, unperturbed by my sharp tone. &#34;I asked if he was single, and he said yes! Isn&#39;t that good news, Mama?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I struggled to maintain my composure. &#34;Aria, why would you ask him something like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because...&#34; Aria&#39;s voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper, &#34;I think he would make a good daddy for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her innocent statement hit me like a physical blow. I sank into a kitchen chair, trying to process her words. My heart raced as a cold fear gripped me. Had Sean somehow managed to manipulate my daughter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aria,&#34; I said carefully, &#34;why would you think that about Mr. Night specifically? Christopher is nice to you too. So is Marcus from my office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aria wrinkled her nose. &#34;They&#39;re different. Mr. Night feels right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned forward, my voice growing serious. &#34;Aria, I need you to be honest with me. Did Mr. Night suggest that he could be your father? Did he tell you to think of him that way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Aria looked genuinely surprised by the question. &#34;I asked him first. Right, Ethan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise, Ethan nodded firmly. &#34;Mama, Ethan can confirm Aria is telling the truth. She asked him first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, momentarily relieved yet still troubled. &#34;Aria, you can&#39;t just ask strangers to be your father. That&#39;s not how it works.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he&#39;s not a stranger anymore,&#34; Aria protested. &#34;And I like him. He feels like a daddy should feel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I asked, my heart in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aria shrugged, struggling to articulate her feelings. &#34;I don&#39;t know. He&#39;s just... he feels right. Ethan likes him too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to my son, whose cheeks flushed instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;N-no, I don&#39;t,&#34; Ethan stammered, avoiding my gaze. &#34;Ethan doesn&#39;t like Mr. Night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His denial was so transparently false that I almost smiled despite my concerns. After a moment, Ethan looked up, his expression worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mama, do you not want us to be around Mr. Night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The direct question caught me off guard. I hesitated, uncertain how to respond without revealing my complicated history with Sean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s getting late,&#34; I said finally. &#34;Why don&#39;t you both go get ready for bed? We can talk more tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After tucking the twins in, I retreated to my bedroom, pulling out my phone. I opened WhatsApp and stared at Mr. Night&#39;s contact information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scrolled through our previous conversations, seeing them now in an entirely new light. Sean had been watching the twins&#39; Instagram account, donating money, communicating with me through comments, all while keeping his true identity hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The timeline suddenly made sense. Sean must have only recently discovered the twins&#39; existence, likely through Olivia after my return to New York.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had known earlier that the Instagram twins he&#39;d been following were his own children, he would have flown to Italy immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I set my phone down, my decision made. Tomorrow at lunch, I would go to the school and confirm what I already knew in my heart to be true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, I pulled up to the school just as the lunch hour began. My suspicions were immediately confirmed when I spotted the familiar black Bentley parked near the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That must be Sean&#39;s car,&#34; I murmured to myself, my knuckles whitening as I gripped the steering wheel. &#34;I knew something was off about that vehicle. I even tried knocking on its window before. My instincts weren&#39;t wrong after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security guard at the gate recognized me immediately. &#34;Ms. Wilson, what brings you here at this hour?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had some free time and thought I&#39;d surprise the children,&#34; I replied smoothly. &#34;May I go in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; the guard nodded. &#34;There&#39;s another parent who came to have lunch with the children. Been coming regularly lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My pulse quickened. &#34;Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, very nice gentleman. I&#39;ve seen your children playing with his relative quite often.&#34; The guard smiled kindly. &#34;If you hurry, you might join them for lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do that,&#34; I replied, my voice betraying none of the storm brewing inside me. As I walked toward the school building, a cold smile touched my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lunch together? That&#39;s never going to happen.</p>
