                <p>Angela POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When?&#34; I asked, my voice steadier than I expected. &#34;When did she die?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean swallowed hard, his Adam&#39;s apple bobbing visibly before he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three years ago. Christmas Eve.&#34; His voice was barely audible. &#34;It was kidney failure that triggered cardiac arrest. By the time we got her to the hospital, it was too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit me like physical blows. Three years. While I had been building a new life in Italy, Elizabeth had passed away with her family by her side - but without me there to say goodbye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elizabeth had kidney failure?&#34; I asked, stunned. &#34;How did I not know this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s gaze dropped to his hands. &#34;Her condition had been deteriorating gradually. Age-related, mostly. That night...&#34; He paused, his voice catching. &#34;That night was different. More severe. By the time we found her...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a bitter laugh, hollow and painful. &#34;What right do I have to ask about any of this? I wasn&#39;t even there when she was ill. I didn&#39;t even know about her kidney problems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She mentioned you,&#34; Sean said quietly. &#34;At the end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head snapped up, eyes locking with his. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She missed you very much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something broke inside me at those words-a dam I&#39;d carefully constructed over five years, holding back emotions I couldn&#39;t afford to feel. Tears filled my eyes and spilled silently down my cheeks. I tried to turn away, to hide this moment of vulnerability, but Sean reached out, pulling me gently against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should have resisted. I should have pulled away immediately. Instead, I found myself collapsing against him, my tears soaking into his shirt as silent sobs wracked my body. His arms encircled me, one hand stroking my hair with unexpected tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay,&#34; he murmured. &#34;It&#39;s all over now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stayed like that, frozen in a moment that seemed to exist outside our complicated history, until the door opened and a nurse entered. She paused momentarily at the sight of us before proceeding to change Sean&#39;s IV bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reality crashed back as I suddenly remembered why Sean was hospitalized-gastric bleeding, collapse, his own medical crisis. And here I was, crying in his arms like he was the healthy one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled away, wiping my face as I moved to the small cabinet in the corner of the room. Finding a clean hospital gown, I turned back to Sean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry I got your shirt all wet,&#34; I said, holding out the garment. &#34;You should change into something dry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean shook his head. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;ll dry soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re already sick. Getting chilled will only make your stomach condition worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My hands are a bit occupied at the moment,&#34; he replied, indicating the IV line inserted into his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the medical equipment, suddenly feeling foolish. Of course he couldn&#39;t easily change clothes with an IV in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat silently in the hospital room for a while, then glanced at my watch and realized it was almost time for the children to be dismissed from school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s getting late,&#34; I said, setting the gown aside. &#34;I should go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had barely turned toward the door when Sean&#39;s hand shot out, grabbing my wrist. His grip was firm, desperate even, as his eyes locked onto mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re leaving?&#34; The vulnerability in his voice was startling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to pull my hand free, but his grip only tightened. &#34;Sean, please let go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you come back tomorrow?&#34; he asked, desperation bleeding into his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I promise I&#39;ll come tomorrow,&#34; I assured him. &#34;The doctor says you need proper rest and care. I&#39;ll look after you during this period.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip relaxed slightly, but he didn&#39;t release me. &#34;What would you like for breakfast? I&#39;ll have Thomas arrange it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything is fine. I&#39;ll eat whatever you bring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll bring breakfast,&#34; I offered, &#34;but I won&#39;t be able to stay for lunch. I have other commitments.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fine. Thomas can handle lunch arrangements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, acutely aware that I couldn&#39;t tell him my &#34;commitments&#34; were our children-Aria and Ethan-who needed their mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s eyes searched mine, a different question forming. &#34;You... you&#39;re not living with Christopher, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I answered simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief visibly washed over him, his lips curving into the slightest smile. &#34;Good. You can go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he released my wrist. I rubbed it absently as I moved toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela,&#34; he called just as my hand touched the handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned back, finding his eyes filled with uncertainty. &#34;You&#39;ll really come tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; I said softly. &#34;I keep my promises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside in the corridor, Thomas straightened from where he&#39;d been leaning against the wall, his expression guarded but apologetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Wilson, I&#39;m truly sorry for-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; I interrupted, keeping my tone businesslike. &#34;You can arrange dinner for Mr. Shaw tonight. Make sure he eats properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if he refuses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met Thomas&#39;s gaze directly. &#34;Then tell him I won&#39;t be coming tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding dawned in Thomas&#39;s eyes. He nodded slowly. &#34;I see. That should be... effective.&#34;</p>
