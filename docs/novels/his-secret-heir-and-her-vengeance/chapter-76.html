                <p>Dr. Carter&#39;s words from this morning&#39;s appointment still rang in my ears: Elizabeth&#39;s condition had improved enough to schedule the surgery for this weekend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the news we&#39;d all been waiting for, though I couldn&#39;t help but notice how Sean&#39;s shoulders had tensed at the announcement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander needed to return to Europe first to handle some urgent foundation business, but Victoria had decided to stay and help take care of Elizabeth. Her presence would likely bring some peace to our household in the coming days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the hospital, Victoria took Elizabeth home while Sean and I returned to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at my watch as I finished reviewing the last quarterly report. The afternoon sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Shaw Tower, and I found myself craving something sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor had warned me to limit my sugar intake during the pregnancy, but I&#39;d made a deal with myself - one small piece of cake each day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bakery downstairs had become my guilty pleasure, their hazelnut chocolate cake worth every calorie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up from my desk, I smoothed down my oversized blazer - a recent wardrobe addition to conceal my slowly changing figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The street outside Shaw Tower bustled with the usual midday crowd. I waited for the crossing signal, adjusting my wool scarf against the winter wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The impact came without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One moment I was standing at the crosswalk, the next I was stumbling forward as something-someone-slammed into me from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in my comfortable sneakers, the force of his impact was too strong, and I couldn&#39;t maintain my balance. I fell forward, my hands instinctively moving to protect my stomach as I fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pavement was rough against my palms as I caught myself, my heart pounding with both fear and fury. &#34;What do you think you&#39;re-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words died in my throat as a large hand wrapped around my wrist, squeezing with deliberate cruelty as it yanked me upward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch where you&#39;re going, miss.&#34; The man&#39;s voice was slurred with affected drunkenness, but the anger in his eyes was unmistakably clear and intense as they locked onto mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about him seemed strangely familiar. I had a nagging feeling that I&#39;d seen him somewhere before, but I couldn&#39;t quite place where.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger surged through me as I stood up, my voice sharp with indignation. &#34;You were the one who crashed into me! You should be the one apologizing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His response was to grab my wrist, his grip tightening painfully. &#34;This is a dangerous city,&#34; he said in a low voice. &#34;All sorts of accidents can happen to pretty ladies who aren&#39;t careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The threat in his words was unmistakable. I tried to pull away, but his fingers only dug deeper into my flesh. Perhaps it was his intimidating build that kept others at bay - no one dared to intervene, choosing instead to hurry past us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe the lady would like you to let go.&#34; The new voice was calm but carried an edge of authority. Michael Smith, Sean&#39;s assistant, stood a few feet away, his expression neutral but his stance ready for confrontation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man released my wrist with exaggerated care. &#34;Just trying to help a lady who took a fall,&#34; he said, his mock-innocent tone making my skin crawl. &#34;No harm meant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as he turned to leave, he leaned close enough for only me to hear his final whisper: &#34;Better be careful in your condition. Wouldn&#39;t want anything to happen to the little one, would we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the world tilt beneath my feet. The casual mention of my pregnancy, delivered with such calculated menace, sent a chill down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was no random encounter-someone had been watching me, following my movements, even tracking my doctor&#39;s appointments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela?&#34; Michael&#39;s voice seemed to come from very far away. &#34;Should I call security?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to breathe, to think past the panic clawing at my throat. I shook my head. &#34;No need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in my private office, I examined my wrist in the afternoon light. My palms were scraped and raw from the fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed with an incoming call from Sophie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told her about what had just happened - the collision, the threat, the way he knew about my pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god, Ang!&#34; Sophie&#39;s voice rose with alarm. &#34;We need to call the police right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And tell them what?&#34; I touched my scraped palms. &#34;That someone accidentally bumped into me at a crosswalk? They won&#39;t find anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This wasn&#39;t just some random accident,&#34; Sophie insisted. &#34;Look, I&#39;ll do some digging, try to find out who this guy is. But right now, the most important thing is keeping you and the baby safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused for a moment. &#34;The person who can protect you best is actually right there with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew she meant Sean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s still your husband,&#34; Sophie pressed. &#34;And whatever game he&#39;s playing with Christina, he wouldn&#39;t let anyone hurt you. Not like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I considered her words, remembering the flash of genuine concern I&#39;d sometimes catch in Sean&#39;s eyes, the way his touch would linger just a moment too long when our hands brushed in passing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you&#39;re right,&#34; I conceded. &#34;But approaching him means admitting weakness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better to appear weak than end up hurt-or worse.&#34; Sophie&#39;s voice softened. &#34;Promise me you&#39;ll at least think about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, I stood at my office window, watching the sun sink behind Manhattan&#39;s gleaming towers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock at my door made me turn. Emily stood there, looking apologetic. &#34;Mr. Shaw is asking for the Morrison portfolio.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the clock-nearly six. Usually, I would have Michael deliver any late files, maintaining the professional distance Sean and I had cultivated. But Sophie&#39;s words echoed in my mind, mixing with the phantom ache in my wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take it to him myself,&#34; I decided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean was at his desk when I entered, his tie loosened, sleeves rolled up as he studied something on his laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up at my entrance, surprise flickering across his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Morrison portfolio,&#34; I said, placing the file on his desk. I turned to leave but hesitated at the door. &#34;Sean...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; There was something in his tone-expectation? hope?-that made my heart skip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you...&#34; I took a deep breath. &#34;Would you mind if I rode home with you tonight?&#34;</p>
