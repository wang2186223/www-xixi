                <p>Sean POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The black Bentley idled at the corner of the street, strategically positioned to observe the school&#39;s entrance while remaining inconspicuous. I sat in the back seat, eyes fixed on the elegant brownstone building where Angela was dropping off the twins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knelt to straighten Ethan&#39;s uniform collar, her movements gentle and practiced. The morning sunlight caught in her hair as she leaned forward to accept Aria&#39;s enthusiastic goodbye kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bye, Mama!&#34; Aria called, waving energetically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember to wait for me right here after school,&#34; Angela reminded them, her voice carrying that tender firmness I&#39;d once known so well. &#34;Go on now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they disappeared through the large wooden doors, Angela stood for a moment, watching them go. Something in her posture-the slight tension in her shoulders, the way she suddenly glanced around-told me she sensed something. Her eyes swept the street, lingering momentarily in our direction before she turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered the window slightly, watching her retreating figure until she disappeared around the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Wilson seems remarkably perceptive,&#34; Thomas observed from beside me. &#34;We&#39;re just sitting here, yet she appeared to sense something. Fortunately, she didn&#39;t spot us, but... Mr. Shaw, why don&#39;t you want her to know you&#39;re here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot him a cold glance. &#34;If she knew, do you think I&#39;d ever get to see those children?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thomas nodded slowly. &#34;Indeed. If those children truly are yours... the fact that Ms. Wilson never told you of their existence clearly indicates she doesn&#39;t want you to know. If she discovers you&#39;re aware, she might immediately disappear with them. The risk is considerable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me, sir, may I ask who you are?&#34; The security guard&#39;s tone was polite but firm as he blocked our path to the school entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thomas stepped forward smoothly. &#34;I&#39;m Thomas Smith, executive assistant to Shaw Group. This is Mr. Sean Shaw, who&#39;s here to make a generous donation to your institution.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of my name and &#34;donation&#34; worked their usual magic. Within minutes, we were being escorted to the principal&#39;s office, where a middle-aged woman in a tailored suit greeted me with barely contained excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Shaw, what an honor to have you visit our school!&#34; The principal beamed, extending her hand. &#34;Your donation is incredibly generous. We cannot thank you enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I maintained my neutral expression, shaking her hand briefly. &#34;Principal, now that the donation has been arranged, I&#39;d be interested in seeing the educational environment you provide. Would it be possible to tour the classrooms?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course!&#34; she exclaimed, clearly thrilled by the request. &#34;I&#39;d be delighted to show you around personally. Please, follow me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we moved through the hallways, the principal enthusiastically detailed the school&#39;s curriculum and facilities. I nodded at appropriate intervals, but my attention was elsewhere, scanning each room we passed for two specific faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After visiting three classrooms, we approached a bright corner room with colorful artwork adorning the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart rate quickened as I caught a glimpse of dark curls through the glass-Aria&#39;s unmistakable bouncing energy as she danced around a table where several children were engaged in an art project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is our kindergarten special activities room,&#34; the principal explained. &#34;The children come here for creative projects and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those children in the corner,&#34; I interrupted, gesturing toward the twins. &#34;Who are they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The principal followed my gaze. &#34;Ah, Aria and Ethan Wilson. They&#39;re quite the little celebrities, actually. They have quite a following on social media with their travel videos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved closer to the door, drawn by an invisible force I couldn&#39;t resist. The principal continued talking, but her words faded into background noise as I stepped into the room, my eyes locked on the two small figures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aria noticed me first, her head snapping up with recognition flashing across her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the handsome mister!&#34; she exclaimed, dropping her crayon and pointing at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan turned more slowly, his green eyes-my eyes-widening slightly as he recognized me too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crouched down to their level, my heart thundering so loudly I was certain everyone could hear it. The world around us seemed to blur as I focused entirely on these two small humans who, I was now certain, carried my blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, he&#39;s the gentleman I met on the airplane, remember I told you?&#34; Aria bubbled, tugging her brother&#39;s sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan nodded, his expression guarded as he regarded me. &#34;Hello, sir,&#34; he said, his tone polite but distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t call me sir,&#34; I replied with a small smile. &#34;You can call me Mr. Night, or Mr. Twilight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Twilight?&#34; Aria&#39;s eyes grew round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you that Night person from our videos?&#34; Ethan asked skeptically, his gaze shrewd and assessing in a way that felt like looking into a mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t I look like him? Or don&#39;t you believe me?&#34; I kept my voice gentle, fighting to control the surge of emotions threatening to overwhelm me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Night!&#34; Aria cheered, instantly accepting, while Ethan maintained his distance, studying me with those piercing eyes that were so unnervingly familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to Ethan, respecting his caution. &#34;You can look more carefully to be sure. There are many imposters online, so it&#39;s good to be cautious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of scrutiny, Ethan spoke again. &#34;I&#39;ve confirmed it&#39;s you, but why didn&#39;t you tell us who you were before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Night,&#34; Aria interjected excitedly, &#34;are you here to register your children for our school?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question hit me with unexpected force. I swallowed hard before answering softly, &#34;My children are already at this school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? What are their names?&#34; Aria bounced on her toes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell you next time,&#34; I said mysteriously, though my heart ached with the truth I couldn&#39;t yet share.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty minutes later, I slid back into the Bentley, my mind reeling from the encounter. Thomas handed me a warm thermos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Shaw, it&#39;s cold today. This will help protect your stomach,&#34; he said, gesturing for me to drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I accepted it wordlessly, taking a careful sip of the honey-infused milk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Shaw, please drink more,&#34; Thomas urged. &#34;Your health is particularly important now, especially with the potential changes coming to your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;Indeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seeing you with those children was quite touching,&#34; Thomas continued. &#34;I couldn&#39;t resist taking a photo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Photo? Send it to me,&#34; I demanded immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I examined the image on my phone, something unfamiliar happened-a genuine smile spread across my face. The photo captured a moment when both children were looking up at me, Aria with open fascination and Ethan with thoughtful curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seemed to connect well with them,&#34; Thomas observed, &#34;though I noticed the boy was quite wary of you. Remarkable caution for someone so young.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s good that my child has such vigilance,&#34; I replied, approval evident in my tone. &#34;It will protect them from harm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Shaw, you&#39;ve already determined they&#39;re your children? Without DNA testing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that necessary?&#34; I countered, my gaze unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now, do you plan to tell Ms. Wilson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I said decisively. &#34;Not yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car pulled away from the curb, I took another look at the photo, my chest tight with an emotion I hadn&#39;t allowed myself to feel in years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My children. Mine.</p>
