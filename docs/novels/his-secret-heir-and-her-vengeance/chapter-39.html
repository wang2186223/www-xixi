                <p>The sound of her footsteps faded, leaving the room in a thick, almost eerie silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exhaled and let my gaze drop, my hand instinctively resting on my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby,&#34; I whispered softly. &#34;Let&#39;s just hope everything goes smoothly. When it&#39;s time, I&#39;ll take you to meet your grandfather. He&#39;ll love you so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of my father brought a bittersweet ache to my chest. I had meant to tell him about the pregnancy. But every time I called, he was too busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first time, he had rushed through the conversation, his voice distracted. The second time, he barely gave me a chance to speak before hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I understood why. His career was his focus right now-his comeback, his work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day before Elizabeth&#39;s surgery, Sean and I decided to visit her at the nursing home, hoping to ease some of her anxiety. We picked up a few gifts, wanting to lift her spirits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we arrived, I started sharing some funny stories from work-tales of strange clients and bizarre situations that had happened over the past week. Elizabeth&#39;s laughter filled the room, and for a moment, I could see the tension in her face start to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean didn&#39;t say much, just sitting quietly beside me, watching. I caught his gaze more than once-gentle, warm, and strangely soft. It was a look I didn&#39;t often see from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the evening wore on, I suggested that I stay the night with Elizabeth. I thought she might appreciate the company before her surgery tomorrow, but she waved it off with a tired smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;m not a child. You two should go home and rest. Come back tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, but Sean stepped in and gently placed his hand on my arm. &#34;Since Grandma says so, we&#39;ll come back early tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elizabeth nodded. &#34;Exactly. It&#39;s late, and I need to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave in, though reluctantly, and stepped forward to give her a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; she said, reaching up to pinch my nose with a teasing grin. &#34;You&#39;re getting more and more talkative, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, but inside, my heart tightened. I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that it might be the last time I saw her. I pushed the thought away, not wanting to dwell on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we were back at home, sean slipped off his jacket, and his deep voice cut through the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go take a shower, then rest early.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I nodded, turning to grab my clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before I could leave, something lingered in my mind. I had been holding onto a question all day, one I wasn&#39;t sure was the right time to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sean,&#34; I said, turning back around, &#34;I need to ask you something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already begun untying his tie, but when he heard my voice, he stopped. His dark eyes fixed on mine, sharp and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated for a moment, then asked, &#34;Should we go to the divorce office before Grandma&#39;s surgery tomorrow, or wait until after?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the words left my mouth, I felt the atmosphere shift. It was as if the air had grown colder, heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately realized it probably wasn&#39;t the right time to ask, especially with everything going on with Elizabeth. She was about to undergo surgery, and Sean was likely feeling the pressure of it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I said quickly, rushing to backtrack. &#34;I shouldn&#39;t have brought this up now. Let&#39;s wait until after her surgery. You should rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before I could turn to leave, Sean stepped forward, blocking my path. His voice dropped low, almost like a warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really want to get a divorce tomorrow, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wasn&#39;t what I meant, but before I could explain, he cut me off, his tone turning ice-cold. &#34;Then, as you wish. We&#39;ll go to the civil affairs office when it opens tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sean...&#34; I stood there in shock for a moment, not sure what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean didn&#39;t wait for me to respond. Without another glance, he turned and walked into the bathroom, his back stiff with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bathroom door slammed shut with a deafening bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood by the bed, my eyes lingering on the wedding photo still sitting on the bedside table. It felt surreal to look at it now, like a</p>
