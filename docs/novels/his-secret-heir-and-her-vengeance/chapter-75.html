                <p>Christina POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at my phone in disbelief, my finger hovering over Sean&#39;s number for the fourth time. Three calls. Three rejections. The sharp ache in my chest had nothing to do with my injury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean Shaw never ignored my calls. Never.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed myself up against the silk pillows of my VIP hospital bed, wincing as the movement pulled at my bandaged forehead. My gaze drifted to the mirror on the opposite wall, and I found myself studying my reflection with growing anxiety. Dr. Carter&#39;s words echoed in my mind: &#34;There might be permanent scarring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe he actually hung up on you.&#34; Jennifer&#39;s voice dripped with calculated sympathy as she settled into one of the plush chairs beside my bed. &#34;But then again, have you seen how cozy Angela&#39;s been getting with Christopher Blake? They were having lunch at The Grand just today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers tightened around the phone. &#34;The Grand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmhmm.&#34; Jennifer took a delicate sip of mineral water, her eyes watching me over the crystal rim. &#34;And that&#39;s not all. Haven&#39;t you noticed something strange about Elizabeth&#39;s surgery schedule? It keeps getting pushed back and back...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to look at my friend, my eyes narrowing. &#34;You think Angela is deliberately delaying Elizabeth&#39;s surgery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought sent ice through my veins. It would be just like that calculating little gold-digger to pull something like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The late afternoon sun painted my hospital room in shades of gold, casting long shadows across the expensive furnishings. I was about to respond when a commotion outside my door drew our attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Jordan?&#34; A flustered nurse appeared in the doorway. &#34;There&#39;s a young man downstairs insisting on seeing you. He says his name is Mike?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My initial reaction was to refuse. Mike was a nobody-a street thug who&#39;d developed an inconvenient fixation on me after a chance encounter at a charity event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to admit, he was handsome in that dangerous, rough-around-the-edges way. One night, after too much champagne at some forgettable fundraiser, I&#39;d let my guard down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had sex in his apartment in some questionable part of town. I&#39;d made him swear to keep it our secret. What was he doing here now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t supposed to show up like this, especially where there was any chance Sean might find out about his existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I needed to know what he wanted. After a moment&#39;s consideration, I decided to see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let him up,&#34; I said, ignoring Jennifer&#39;s look of shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina!&#34; Jennifer hissed. &#34;You can&#39;t be serious. He&#39;s... he&#39;s...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A concerned friend,&#34; I cut her off smoothly, already adjusting my designer hospital gown to look more vulnerable. &#34;Please, Jennifer. Stay with me while I receive him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used the few minutes before Mike&#39;s arrival to perfect my pose. The bandage needed to catch the light just so, highlighting the injury without being too obvious about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Mike burst through the door, it was like watching a bull crash into a china shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His knockoff designer clothes and rough manners couldn&#39;t have been more out of place in my refined hospital suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bouquet of roses in his hands looked like they&#39;d been bought from a street vendor-cheap and gaudy against the elegant flower arrangements already filling my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Jordan!&#34; His voice was too loud, making me wince internally. &#34;I heard what happened. I came as soon as I could.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed a weak smile, carefully angling my face. &#34;Mike, you shouldn&#39;t have...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who did this to you?&#34; His fists clenched at his sides, his street-hardened face darkening with anger. Perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught Jennifer&#39;s perfectly plucked eyebrows arching as she took in Mike&#39;s appearance. &#34;My, my. What... interesting company you keep, Christina darling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed how Mike&#39;s jaw tightened at Jennifer&#39;s tone, how his eyes narrowed at the obvious dismissal in her voice. The tension in the room was exactly what I needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jennifer,&#34; I made my voice hold just the right note of gentle reproach. &#34;Mike was kind enough to visit me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Mike&#39;s expression softened as he looked at me was almost pathetic. His obvious adoration made Jennifer roll her eyes behind his back, but I had to fight to suppress a smile. Everything was falling into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It must have been terrifying,&#34; Mike said, stepping closer to my bed. &#34;Being attacked like that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t say attacked,&#34; I demurred, then winced theatrically. &#34;It was just... well...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just Angela Shaw shoving her into a marble statue,&#34; Jennifer finished sharply. &#34;And now look-there might be permanent scarring. All because that gold-digger couldn&#39;t handle seeing Christina with Sean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mike&#39;s expression grew thunderous. &#34;She did what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I touched my bandage gently, letting my hand tremble slightly. &#34;Please, it&#39;s nothing. I&#39;m sure she didn&#39;t mean to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like hell she didn&#39;t!&#34; Mike&#39;s voice rose dangerously. &#34;In my neighborhood, we know how to handle people who think they can get away with hurting others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Jordan,&#34; Mike&#39;s voice had dropped to a dangerous growl. &#34;Where I come from, we have ways of dealing with this kind of thing. Nobody hurts someone I care about and gets away with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached out, letting my fingers brush against his sleeve. The cheap fabric made my skin crawl, but I forced myself to maintain contact. &#34;You&#39;re sweet to want to protect me, but please... I couldn&#39;t bear it if you got into trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look he gave me was filled with such fierce devotion it almost made me laugh. Instead, I let my eyes fill with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just... I never thought someone could be so cruel,&#34; I whispered, my voice breaking just enough. &#34;And now, my face...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mike&#39;s expression hardened with resolve. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Miss Jordan. I&#39;ll make sure she learns her lesson. Nobody&#39;s gonna hurt you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he turned to leave, I caught his sleeve. &#34;Mike, please,&#34; I said softly. &#34;I tried to tell you... you shouldn&#39;t do anything reckless...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina,&#34; Jennifer cut in sharply before Mike could respond. &#34;You&#39;re too kind-hearted. That woman hurt you, and now there might be permanent scarring. Someone needs to teach her a lesson.&#34; Her eyes glittered with malice as she looked at Mike. &#34;If you want to be her knight in shining armor, why should she stop you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Mike stormed out, I gazed out the window at the setting sun. &#34;I have no idea what you mean, Jennifer. I simply received a concerned friend&#39;s visit.&#34; My lips curved into an innocent smile, but my mind was already several steps ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shadows lengthened across my hospital room floor, and I closed my eyes, exhausted by the day&#39;s events.</p>
