                <p>Sean POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria.&#34; Angela&#39;s voice was warm, though I caught the slight tension in her shoulders. &#34;What a lovely surprise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling.&#34; My mother moved to embrace Angela, shooting me a disapproving look over her shoulder. &#34;I hope my son hasn&#39;t been making things difficult for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Angela could respond, the sound of a door opening down the hall drew our attention. Elizabeth appeared, her silver hair perfectly coiffed despite the early hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria!&#34; Elizabeth&#39;s face lit up. &#34;Alexander called to say you were both coming, but I hardly dared believe it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother.&#34; I cut in, studying her face carefully. &#34;Why did you suddenly return from Europe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t parents visit their son without an interrogation?&#34; Victoria&#39;s tone was light, but her eyes were sharp as she glanced between Angela and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought we could all have breakfast together. Though I must say, Sean, if you&#39;ve done something to make Angela kick you out of bed, you should have had the decency to sleep on the floor, not the expensive Italian leather.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela stepped forward, her professional mask firmly in place. &#34;It&#39;s not what you think, Victoria. Sean was just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Working late,&#34; I finished quickly. &#34;I didn&#39;t want to disturb anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How considerate.&#34; My mother&#39;s voice dripped with sarcasm. &#34;Though I seem to recall you having no such concerns when you were living at home. The number of times you stumbled in at dawn...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria,&#34; Elizabeth interrupted gently, &#34;shall we have breakfast? Sarah has prepared your favorite croissants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we settled around the dining table, I couldn&#39;t help but notice how naturally Angela fit into this tableau of Shaw family domesticity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved with easy grace, ensuring Elizabeth&#39;s tea was exactly how she liked it, engaging Victoria in conversation about her latest charitable endeavors in Europe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve been away so long,&#34; Victoria said to Elizabeth, genuine regret in her voice. &#34;The foundation&#39;s new projects have been all-consuming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t apologize,&#34; Elizabeth smiled. &#34;Angela has been taking wonderful care of me. Such a thoughtful girl-always remembering my medications, accompanying me to every doctor&#39;s appointment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as my mother&#39;s expression softened, noting how she reached out to squeeze Angela&#39;s hand. The gesture sent a wave of guilt washing over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this time, I&#39;d been so focused on maintaining the facade of our arrangement that I&#39;d failed to see the reality: Angela wasn&#39;t playing a role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was genuinely caring for my family, filling gaps I hadn&#39;t even noticed existed. The realization made my throat tight with shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How many of her quiet acts of kindness had I dismissed or taken for granted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive to the hospital should have taken thirty minutes. In the tense silence of the Bentley&#39;s interior, it felt like hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My parents had taken Elizabeth in their car, leaving Angela and me alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we pulled away from the curb, Angela&#39;s warm demeanor vanished. She sat rigid in the passenger seat, staring straight ahead, her hands folded tightly in her lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela-&#34; I started, but she cut me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t.&#34; Her voice was ice. &#34;Let&#39;s just get through this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in her tone made my hands tighten on the steering wheel. The familiar surge of frustration rose in my chest-the same feeling that had driven me to kiss her last night, only to be pushed away. Without thinking, I pressed harder on the accelerator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screech of tires came with barely any warning. A delivery truck appeared around the corner, its horn blaring as I swerved sharply to avoid it. Angela&#39;s gasp cut through the air like a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled over immediately, my heart hammering. &#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I turned to look at her, I saw tears sliding down her cheeks. The sight hit me like a physical blow. Angela Wilson Shaw didn&#39;t cry-not when her family&#39;s company collapsed, not during our countless arguments, not even last night when I&#39;d crossed a line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela, I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have-&#34; I reached for her, but she flinched away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t touch me.&#34; Her voice broke slightly. &#34;Just... don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the door and stepped out onto the sidewalk, leaving me alone with the weight of my mistakes. Through the windshield, I watched her pace slowly, one hand pressed against her stomach as if she felt ill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gesture triggered a memory from two months ago-another morning, another car ride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been laughing then, her head thrown back against the seat as I told her about William&#39;s latest romantic disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I&#39;d reached over to brush a strand of hair from her face, she hadn&#39;t pulled away. Instead, she&#39;d caught my hand, pressing a kiss to my palm that sent electricity shooting through my veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had changed since then? When had we lost that easy intimacy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela returned to the car after a few minutes, her composure restored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We drove the rest of the way in silence, but I couldn&#39;t shake the image of her tears, or the growing certainty that I was somehow losing something precious without understanding exactly what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived at Presbyterian Hospital, I hurried around to Angela&#39;s side before she could open her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I offered my hand and she took it, allowing me to help her from the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, driven by an impulse I couldn&#39;t quite name, I slipped my arm around her shoulders as we walked toward the entrance. Her body tensed slightly at the contact, but she didn&#39;t pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We found my parents already waiting in the VIP wing. Elizabeth was being prepped for her tests, leaving us to wait in the pristine corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone vibrated in my pocket. Christina&#39;s name flashed across the screen, and I quickly hit decline, hoping no one had noticed. Minutes later, it buzzed again. Another call from Christina. Again, I ended it without answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her name appeared for the third time, I felt a bead of sweat form at my temple as I terminated the call. Glancing up guiltily, I found Angela standing with her arms crossed tightly over her chest, deliberately looking anywhere but at me. My mother, however, fixed me with that penetrating stare I remembered from childhood interrogations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who keeps calling you?&#34; Victoria&#39;s voice was deceptively casual. &#34;And why aren&#39;t you answering?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked you a question, Sean.&#34; Victoria&#39;s voice took on that dangerous sweetness I remembered from childhood scoldings. The silence that followed felt heavy with unspoken accusations, but before I could respond, Dr. Carter appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression was professionally neutral as he approached our group. &#34;Mrs. Shaw is ready for her consultation. Would you all follow me, please?&#34;</p>
