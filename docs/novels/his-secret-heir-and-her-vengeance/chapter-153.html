                <p>Angela POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t you just admit you&#39;re pissed at me over another woman!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s accusation hit like a slap. I felt exposed, as if he&#39;d peeled back my carefully constructed facade and revealed the raw hurt beneath. Yet even as I recognized the truth in his words, indignation flared within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t flatter yourself,&#34; I replied coldly, trying to mask how his words had pierced me. &#34;I&#39;m not jealous. I simply despise men who can&#39;t remain faithful or constant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind flashed unexpectedly to last month&#39;s charity auction. I&#39;d spotted Sean across the ballroom, Christina Jordan clinging to his arm, her red lips curving into a possessive smile as she whispered something in his ear. The image burned in my memory, bringing a bitter taste to my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing between Christina and me,&#34; Sean insisted, his green eyes searching mine with an intensity that made my breath catch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could snap back, his hands were on me-strong fingers curling around my hips, yanking me flush against him. My back hit the cool metal of the car as his body pinned me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I have now, Angela?&#34; he murmured, his breath warm against my ear. &#34;All I have are these tiny changes in your demeanor to judge whether you still feel anything for me. Even if it&#39;s just a trace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remained rigid in his embrace, desperately fighting to maintain my composure. I felt like ice, frozen in his arms, unable to move away yet refusing to yield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly are you trying to say?&#34; I challenged, injecting as much derision into my voice as possible. &#34;Has the mighty CEO of Shaw Group suddenly turned sentimental?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s eyes narrowed, his jaw tightening. &#34;Can&#39;t you hear what I&#39;m saying, Angela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice echoed in the empty parking garage, amplifying the tension between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me guess,&#34; I said with mock thoughtfulness, my tone deliberately provocative. &#34;You regret our divorce? You want to start over? The great Sean Shaw wants to give us another chance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I infused each word with scorn, already preparing the cutting rejection I would deliver when he admitted it. Part of me anticipated-perhaps even hoped for-seeing him retreat the way he had five years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sean saw through my strategy. His lips curved into a knowing smile that sent a jolt of awareness through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why provoke me when I&#39;ve made myself painfully obvious?&#34; he asked softly. &#34;Yes, you&#39;re right. I do regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned closer, his face mere inches from mine. I could feel his breath against my lips, the heat of his body overwhelming my senses. Just as our lips nearly touched, I let out a contemptuous laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean immediately froze, pulling back slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what makes you think I&#39;d ever accept your change of heart?&#34; I demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The garage lighting cast harsh shadows across his handsome features, highlighting the intensity in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were the one who contacted the lawyer first,&#34; I continued, the old pain seeping into my voice despite my efforts to sound indifferent. &#34;You initiated our divorce, Sean. You walked away first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I gave you what you wanted,&#34; he countered. &#34;Filing for divorce was fulfilling your wish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My wish?&#34; I repeated incredulously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you remember what happened after our first night together?&#34; Sean&#39;s eyes darkened with hurt. &#34;You called it &#39;just a normal physiological need.&#39; As if what we shared meant nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice hardened as he continued, &#34;And then you asked me for five million dollars in compensation. You turned what we had into a transaction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That money was an investment,&#34; I shot back defensively. &#34;I&#39;ve already returned every cent through the investment account. I don&#39;t owe you anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to step around him toward my car, but he blocked my path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The money was never the issue,&#34; Sean said, frustration evident in his tone. &#34;It was how easily you dismissed what happened between us. And then there was your confession about Christopher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him, genuinely confused. In my recollection, Sean had been the one to call our night together &#34;an accident,&#34; forcing me to save face by agreeing it was merely physical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t it you who said that night was just an accident?&#34; I challenged, my voice steady despite my racing heart. &#34;Those were your exact words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s expression shifted, something unreadable flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or are you changing your story now?&#34; I pressed, sarcasm dripping from my words. &#34;Should I believe you had ulterior motives all along? Even Hollywood&#39;s best screenwriters wouldn&#39;t buy that script.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34; Sean asked simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question hung between us in the silent garage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand moved to the nape of my neck, gentle yet firm as he drew me closer once more. I could feel his breath caressing my cheek, his lips hovering just above mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haven&#39;t you ever considered,&#34; Sean whispered, his emerald eyes gleaming dangerously in the dim light,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;that I might have wanted you all along? That night wasn&#39;t an accident, Angela. I truly wanted you.&#34;</p>
