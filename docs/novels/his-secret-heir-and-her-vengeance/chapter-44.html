                <p>When I saw that car speeding toward Angela, my heart stopped. Time seemed to freeze for a split second as my mind went blank. I didn&#39;t think. I didn&#39;t hesitate. I just moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My legs propelled me forward as if they had a mind of their own. There was no question in my head-I couldn&#39;t let her get hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached her just as she froze in the middle of the street, too caught in her thoughts to move. Without a second thought, I grabbed her, yanking her into my arms. We both fell to the ground, the impact of the fall sharp against the pavement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, all I could hear was the rush of blood in my ears, my breath ragged as I clutched her to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was afraid to let go, afraid to check if she was okay, afraid that if I did, she might be hurt. But I could feel her-her soft, warm body pressed tightly against mine, her breath a steady rhythm under my fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held her tighter, relief flooding through me in waves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t get rid of the images from the seconds before. The car coming straight for her. The way she hadn&#39;t seen it. The fear that had clenched my chest so tightly I couldn&#39;t breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as I held her, my mind began to calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I even felt the warmth of her lips brush against my throat, soft and almost hesitant, like she didn&#39;t realize what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world around us started to return to normal. I was aware of the whispers, the murmurs of the onlookers who had gathered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you two alright?&#34; A voice from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely acknowledged them, my focus only on Angela. I could still feel the heat of her body in my arms, the way her chest rose and fell with each breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers tightened around her, and I couldn&#39;t let go-not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we finally got to our feet, I made sure to keep my hand firmly wrapped around hers. The grip was tighter than necessary, but I didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stood there, my mind still racing from the events that had just unfolded, Angela&#39;s voice broke through the haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your shoulder... it&#39;s bleeding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until she spoke that I felt a sharp, insistent pain shooting from my left shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the pain in my shoulder was nothing compared to the fear of losing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was apologizing again, her voice soft, uncertain. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry, Sean...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to tell her that it wasn&#39;t anger I was feeling, that I wasn&#39;t mad at her. I wasn&#39;t angry at all. What I was, was terrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our two years of marriage had been a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the memories we shared-the countless moments where we laughed together, where we comforted each other-those were real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d known each other for so long-since we were kids, sharing secrets and dreams, seeing each other at our worst and our best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, as we were about to part ways, I couldn&#39;t imagine my life without her in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t paying attention. I just I was so worried about Elizabeth, and I&#34; Angela explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can understand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the truth in her eyes. I knew she cared for Elizabeth, just as much as I did. Their bond was undeniable-one forged over years of friendship and shared moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also understood why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela had lost her mother when she was young, and I often wondered if Elizabeth&#39;s care for her had filled that void, even if just a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered before we even got married, how Elizabeth had shared advice with Angela-advice on dealing with things like menstrual pain, things women often discuss among themselves in private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was those small, intimate exchanges that spoke to the closeness they shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Elizabeth found out I was going to marry Angela, her concern was less about the wedding itself and more about me-she wanted to make sure I would treat Angela well, that I wouldn&#39;t hurt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if Elizabeth knew the truth, if she knew this marriage was just a formality, a lie we&#39;d been living... I couldn&#39;t help but think that two years ago, she would never have supported it. She would&#39;ve seen right through us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt to think about that-how we had deceived the people closest to us, how we had played this role without ever being honest. But Angela and I were too deep in it now, tangled in the mess we&#39;d created.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if Elizabeth ever found out... I couldn&#39;t bear to think of the disappointment in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived at the sanatorium, the doctor looked at me with a bit of surprise but quickly composed himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could only imagine how bad I looked-probably like a zombie. I hadn&#39;t slept at all last night, dark circles under my eyes, and I hadn&#39;t shaved in two days. On top of that, Angela and Elizabeth had almost scared me half to death today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elizabeth fainted because of the stress. Her vital signs are normal, and there&#39;s nothing else to worry about,&#34; the doctor said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Angela and I let out a relieved breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then the doctor added, &#34;That said, given her current mental state, it&#39;s not ideal to perform surgery right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What can we do? Is there a solution?&#34; Angela asked, her voice filled with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll start her on medication to help stabilize her, but you&#39;ll also need to support her emotionally,&#34; the doctor explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela pressed her lips together, clearly troubled by the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped closer and took her hand. &#34;We&#39;ll help her get through this. Let&#39;s go see her now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angela nodded, then suddenly paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, let the nurse clean the wound on your shoulder first.&#34;</p>
