                <p>Sean POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain dripped from my hair as I stared out the window of the town car, watching the dreary landscape scroll past in a blur of grays and muted greens. Angela sat across from me, wrapped in my jacket, her skin still too pale after her collapse at the cemetery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t understand her anger back there, her accusation ringing in my ears: &#34;If it weren&#39;t for you, I never would have left Elizabeth.&#34; What the hell did that even mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five years ago, she was the one who told me she loved Christopher Blake. I still remember that moment with painful clarity-standing in our living room, her eyes avoiding mine as she said those words that shattered everything: &#34;I love him. I love Christopher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, technically I was the one who suggested we go to court to finalize the divorce, but what choice did she leave me? She&#39;d already decided to replace me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now she had the audacity to act like I was the villain in our story? Like I was the reason she missed saying goodbye to Elizabeth? What right did she have to place that guilt on me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled up to the hotel, and Thomas rushed forward with an umbrella, helping Angela inside while I followed, my clothes still soaked through despite the towel I&#39;d used earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once back in my hotel suite, I peeled off my wet clothes and stepped into a scalding shower, trying to wash away both the physical chill and the confusion clouding my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After changing into dry clothes, I picked up my phone, staring at Angela&#39;s contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite my irritation, I found myself tapping out a message: Lunch in thirty minutes?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her response came quickly: No, I need to rest. Thank you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tossed the phone onto the bed, frustration building beneath my ribs. Thomas knocked tentatively at the door, then entered when I called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Wilson declined the lunch invitation?&#34; he asked carefully, quickly pocketing his phone when he saw my expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She says she needs to rest,&#34; I replied, not bothering to hide my annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thomas nodded sympathetically. &#34;She&#39;s had a difficult morning, sir. The emotional strain of visiting Mrs. Shaw&#39;s grave, plus her fainting spell... Perhaps she genuinely needs the rest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said nothing, just walked into the bedroom and closed the door behind me. If she wanted space, fine. I&#39;d give her space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around noon, Thomas arranged for food to be delivered. While I was still on a restricted diet, I&#39;d graduated from bland soups to more substantial fare. I picked at the grilled chicken and steamed vegetables, my appetite dampened not by my physical condition but by my thoughts of Angela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s been resting for how long now?&#34; I asked, breaking the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thomas checked his watch. &#34;About two hours, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Order lunch for her too,&#34; I instructed, ignoring the twist of hunger in my stomach that had nothing to do with food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thomas hesitated. &#34;But Ms. Wilson said-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there something wrong with eating before resting?&#34; I cut him off sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not. I&#39;ll arrange it immediately,&#34; he replied, reaching for his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned to the window, watching raindrops race down the glass. Rest. That&#39;s all she seemed to want-rest from her company, rest from her responsibilities, rest from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty minutes later, I heard voices in the hallway. Stepping out of my thoughts, I moved to the door, listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve rung several times, but there&#39;s no answer,&#34; a hotel staff member was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something cold slithered through my chest. I yanked open my door and stepped into the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a problem?&#34; I asked, eyeing the food cart parked outside Angela&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, we&#39;ve brought the meal you ordered, but it seems your friend isn&#39;t answering,&#34; the server explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thomas immediately stepped forward. &#34;I&#39;ll call her,&#34; he offered, already dialing. The phone rang on speaker, and my muscles tensed with each tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; Angela&#39;s voice came through clearly-too clearly for someone who&#39;d just woken up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Wilson, have you rested well?&#34; Thomas asked carefully. &#34;If you&#39;re awake, could you please open the door? Mr. Shaw has arranged lunch to be delivered to your room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That won&#39;t be necessary, Thomas. Thank you for your concern, but I&#39;ve already left the hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit me like a physical blow. Left? After we&#39;d just visited Elizabeth&#39;s grave together?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Ms. Wilson, you-&#34; Thomas stammered, looking as surprised as I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m on my way back to New York. Please let Sean know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snatched the phone from Thomas&#39;s hand. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard me correctly. How convenient that you&#39;re already on the line, so Thomas doesn&#39;t need to relay the message.&#34; Her voice was infuriatingly composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela, what is this supposed to mean?&#34; I fought to keep my anger in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing in particular. This was just a transaction between us, remember? I told you at the hospital-I only came to see Elizabeth. Now that I&#39;ve fulfilled our agreement, I need to get back to New York. I have work waiting for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Weren&#39;t you supposedly unwell and needing rest?&#34; I gritted out, my fingers tightening around the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I rested for twenty minutes. Is that a problem?&#34; Her casual dismissal made my blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait for me there,&#34; I commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s not possible, Mr. Shaw. I&#39;ve already purchased my ticket and will be departing shortly. Even if you came now, you wouldn&#39;t make it in time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angela, do you think returning to New York puts you beyond my reach?&#34; The threat slipped out before I could stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly are you implying, Mr. Shaw? I&#39;m simply returning to work. Is there something wrong with that?&#34; Her feigned innocence was like gasoline on a fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. Go back to New York. Just wait for me there.&#34; My voice had gone cold, detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. I&#39;ll eagerly await your grand arrival,&#34; she replied, sarcasm dripping from every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended, and I stood frozen, a wave of betrayal washing over me. We had just stood together at Elizabeth&#39;s grave. She had collapsed in my arms, her vulnerability so raw and real. And now she was fleeing like a thief in the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I handed the phone back to Thomas, my expression dark enough that he took a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Wilson has already left town?&#34; he asked cautiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gone back to New York,&#34; I replied curtly, my mind already mapping out my next moves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thomas turned to the server. &#34;You can take the food back. The guest has departed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they left, I remained in the doorway, staring at the empty hallway. What was she running from?</p>
