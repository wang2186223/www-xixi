                <p>Angela POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clutched David Chen&#39;s offered arm as we navigated through the crowded entrance of Sotheby&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The opulent auction hall buzzed with Manhattan&#39;s elite-faces I hadn&#39;t seen in five years but who clearly remembered me, if their whispers and sidelong glances were any indication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Wilson, I apologize for the last-minute change,&#34; David said in his perfectly modulated voice. &#34;Mr. Blake was called into an urgent meeting. He&#39;s asked me to accompany you tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, David,&#34; I replied. &#34;Christopher has more important things to attend to than a charity auction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David nodded respectfully. &#34;Ms. Wilson, your seat is in the private box upstairs. Mr. Blake arranged it specifically.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auctioneer tapped his microphone, drawing the room&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ladies and gentlemen, we&#39;ve concluded our regular offerings and now move to tonight&#39;s highlight-original Monet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I settled into my seat, grateful for the relative privacy of the box as bidding began. Numbers flew across the room, wealth displayed in casual seven-figure increments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Six million dollars from Mr. Shaw!&#34; the auctioneer announced with barely contained excitement. &#34;Do I hear six point five?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it really be him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scanned the room frantically, my eyes darting between faces, but couldn&#39;t spot him anywhere. He must be in one of the private boxes, like me-hidden from the general audience but very much present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what would I even do if I saw him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could I possibly say after five years of silence?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Shaw increases his bid to six point five million!&#34; the auctioneer called out again, the name striking me like a physical blow each time it was uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers clutched the armrest, knuckles turning white as that name-the one I had avoided speaking for five years-sliced through my composure like a blade through silk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room suddenly felt airless, oxygen replaced by memories I&#39;d fought so hard to suppress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David leaned closer, concern evident in his expression. &#34;Ms. Wilson, are you alright? You&#39;ve gone quite pale.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just...a bit lightheaded,&#34; I managed, my voice sounding distant even to my own ears. &#34;I think I need some air.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like me to accompany you?&#34; David asked, already half-rising from his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;No, please stay. I&#39;ll just step out for a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My legs felt unsteady as I made my way to the exit, my heart hammering against my ribs with each step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corridor outside was empty. I leaned against the wall, eyes closed, willing my pulse to slow. Winter rain fell gently beyond the windows, the carpet near the entrance damp from guests&#39; footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrapped my cashmere shawl tighter around my shoulders, the New York winter far harsher than the mild Tuscan climate I&#39;d grown accustomed to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chill in the air matched the one in my memories-my last encounter with Sean had been during another winter, in another lifetime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five years, I thought, pressing my palm against my forehead. I&#39;ve built a new life, I have Aria and Ethan, I&#39;ve moved on. Why am I still affected like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I straightened, wiping away the cold sweat that had formed on my brow. I turned to walk toward the ladies&#39; room when a tall figure stepped into my path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me,&#34; I murmured</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man before me wore an impeccably tailored Armani suit in midnight blue, his tie knotted with mathematical precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello,&#34; he said, his smile revealing perfect teeth. &#34;You&#39;re Angela Wilson, aren&#39;t you? I&#39;m Tristan Lawrence, George Lawrence&#39;s son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked, recognition dawning. The sole heir to the Lawrence Capital empire, Tristan&#39;s reputation as both a financial prodigy and Manhattan&#39;s most eligible bachelor preceded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His notorious playboy reputation was equally well-known-gossip columns had famously reported that at his thirtieth birthday party, he&#39;d drunkenly vowed to bed a thousand beautiful women before settling down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Lawrence,&#34; I acknowledged, accepting his extended hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father speaks very highly of you,&#34; Tristan continued, his grip firm but not overbearing. &#34;Says you&#39;re the most talented investment advisor he&#39;s ever tried to recruit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s kind of him to say,&#34; I replied, trying to regain my composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father mentioned he&#39;s made several attempts to bring you on board at Lawrence Capital. May I ask why you&#39;ve declined? Were his terms not satisfactory, or is it something about the company itself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chose my words carefully, unwilling to reveal my plans for establishing my own firm. &#34;I appreciate your father&#39;s offers, but my reasons for declining are personal. .&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s smile widened, transforming his face with boyish charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fair enough. Though you should know that I&#39;ll be taking over operations soon, and if you were to join us, I&#39;d ensure you received... special consideration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could respond, Tristan removed his jacket and draped it over my shoulders in one fluid motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;New York winters are brutal compared to the Italian countryside,&#34; he said, his voice lowering slightly. &#34;I&#39;ve just returned from the French Riviera-the contrast between Mediterranean sunshine and Manhattan ice is quite jarring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gesture caught me off-guard, the jacket still warm from his body heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should return to the auction,&#34; Tristan said, glancing at his watch. &#34;I&#39;m hosting at The Plaza later tonight-nothing formal, just drinks and conversation. My driver can pick you up whenever you&#39;re ready to leave here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped back with a slight bow, walking away before I could return his jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved to follow him, intending to return the garment, but he had already disappeared around a corner. With a sigh, I headed toward the entrance, hoping to hand the jacket to an attendant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me,&#34; I said to a young woman staffing the coat check. &#34;Could you please return this to Mr. Lawrence when you see him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant&#39;s eyes widened slightly. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Ms. Wilson, but if Mr. Lawrence gave you his jacket, you should probably return it to him personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know where he&#39;s gone,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Lawrence is something of a fixture at The Plaza,&#34; the young woman replied, a hint of gossip in her tone. &#34;Hosts parties there almost weekly. Though I must say, him giving you his jacket is unusual-he typically doesn&#39;t leave... tokens... with the women he meets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant leaned forward slightly. &#34;Mr. Lawrence never leaves evidence. Giving you his jacket means he wants you to find him to return it-it&#39;s his way of ensuring a second meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see,&#34; I replied. &#34;Thank you for the information.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I straightened, preparing to return to the auction room when a movement at the entrance caught my eye. My heart stuttered to a stop, the world around me seeming to freeze in that singular moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean Shaw stood just inside the doorway, commanding attention without effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His white shirt contrasted sharply with his black suit, his cold, handsome features set in the same impassive expression I remembered all too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him stood Christina Jordan, resplendent in a floor-length pink gown, the hem slightly damp from the rain outside. She clung to his arm with practiced intimacy, her red hair gleaming under the chandeliers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They looked perfect together-the power couple everyone had always expected them to be. Other guests turned to acknowledge them, respect and admiration evident in their deference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain lanced through my chest, sharper than I&#39;d anticipated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So they really did end up together, I thought, biting my lower lip to ground myself. Their children must be the same age as Aria and Ethan by now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean&#39;s head turned suddenly, as if sensing my presence, his gaze sweeping the lobby. I froze, unable to move or breathe, pressing myself deeper into the shadowed corner where I stood. My hands turned to ice as I watched his eyes narrow, searching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For one terrible moment, I thought he might have seen me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then someone called his name, drawing his attention away, and I remained hidden, my heart thundering in my chest.</p>
