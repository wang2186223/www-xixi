                <p>Angela POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time David dropped me off, it was already 10 PM. When I&#39;m with the kids in Italy, I&#39;d usually be getting them tucked in right about now, then catching up on work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But tonight, ever since I ran into Sean, I just couldn&#39;t relax. Olivia suggested we head to one of her favorite bars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I&#39;m lucky, I might run into this guy I&#39;ve been crushing on! I&#39;m definitely getting his number tonight!&#34; Olivia said, practically buzzing with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought to myself, a drink tonight wouldn&#39;t hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Olivia and I were about to leave, David stopped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Wilson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught David Chen&#39;s concerned expression as he stood in the doorway of Olivia&#39;s brownstone, his forehead creased with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Wilson, the auction ended quite late. Is it really appropriate to go out at this hour?&#34; he asked, his tone carefully respectful yet unmistakably disapproving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside me, Olivia rolled her eyes dramatically. &#34;Good heavens, David! It&#39;s barely ten o&#39;clock. When did you become such an old fuddy-duddy? You&#39;re still young!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw the tension in David&#39;s stance-his well-tailored suit couldn&#39;t hide his discomfort. Christopher had hired him to keep me safe, not to watch me venture out at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not the time that concerns me, Ms. Harrison. It&#39;s your safety. Two women alone at night-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the Upper East Side of Manhattan,&#34; Olivia interrupted, adjusting her designer clutch. &#34;There are security guards and cameras on every corner. We&#39;ll be perfectly fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, recognizing the futility of arguing when Olivia had that determined glint in her eye. Instead, I turned to David. &#34;Please make sure Aria and Ethan are in bed by nine. And no more iPad time tonight, even if they beg.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, Ms. Wilson,&#34; David nodded respectfully. &#34;I&#39;ll ensure they follow their routine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on!&#34; Olivia tugged at my arm with childlike impatience. &#34;We need to get there before it gets too crowded.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the door closed behind us, I caught a glimpse of David already reaching for his phone. No doubt calling Christopher to report my whereabouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought should have irritated me, but instead, it brought an odd comfort-someone was watching out for my children while I indulged in this rare night out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Rain was exactly as exclusive as Olivia had described-understated luxury with a skilled jazz pianist playing softly in the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crystal chandeliers cast a warm glow over the intimate space, and I found myself relaxing slightly as we settled into plush velvet chairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think?&#34; Olivia asked proudly, gesturing around the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s lovely,&#34; I admitted, accepting a glass of sparkling water from a passing server. My gaze swept the room, unconsciously searching for familiar faces-a habit I&#39;d developed since returning to New York.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, when does your mystery man usually appear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia&#39;s excitement dimmed slightly. &#34;It&#39;s getting late. I&#39;m not sure he&#39;ll show up tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be discouraged,&#34; I reached across to pat her hand reassuringly. &#34;Let&#39;s call it a lucky draw. If he doesn&#39;t come, I&#39;ll keep you company for a while. The atmosphere is nice enough to sit and chat for an hour or two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia&#39;s eyes softened with affection. &#34;Angela, you&#39;re such a good friend. We&#39;ll always be friends, won&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could respond, a tall man in an expensive suit approached our table, his confident stance announcing his intentions before he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inwardly sighed, recognizing the type immediately from his designer suit and ostentatious watch-another wealthy show-off who thought his money made him irresistible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me, ladies. I couldn&#39;t help noticing you from across the room. May I join you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for the offer, but we&#39;re having a private conversation,&#34; I replied with a polite smile that I kept deliberately cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only want to buy you a drink. Do you know how many women would kill for this opportunity?&#34; he pressed, hovering at the edge of our table, his cologne overwhelming as he leaned in closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m married. If you don&#39;t want my husband to beat you to a pulp and see your face plastered across tomorrow&#39;s tabloids, I suggest you leave right now,&#34; I stated coldly, my eyes never leaving his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s face drained of color as he took a step back, his previous confidence evaporating instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My apologies,&#34; he stammered, adjusting his tie nervously. &#34;I didn&#39;t realize who... I&#39;ll just go.&#34; He retreated hastily, nearly bumping into a waiter in his rush to escape our table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked away, Olivia laughed softly. &#34;You&#39;ve gotten much more direct these days. Five years ago, you would have made up some polite excuse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Directness saves time,&#34; I replied, sipping my water. &#34;Especially now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your husband？ Christopher?&#34; Olivia asked, eyebrows raised suggestively. &#34;He&#39;s clearly interested in you. You should consider giving yourself another chance at happiness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head firmly. &#34;Two children are more than enough for me. Taking care of the twins already consumes most of my energy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of my beautiful children brought a genuine smile to my face, softening my features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speaking of genetically blessed children,&#34; Olivia leaned forward conspiratorially, &#34;I wouldn&#39;t mind borrowing some genes from that gorgeous man I told you about. His features and presence are simply perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia&#39;s bold declaration made my hand jerk, spilling orange juice onto my white coat. &#34;Damn it,&#34; I muttered, dabbing at the stain with a napkin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I better deal with this before it sets,&#34; I said, rising from my seat. &#34;I&#39;ll be right back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the restroom, I carefully blotted the stain with damp paper towels, relieved to see it fading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied with my cleaning efforts, I gathered my belongings and exited, rounding the corner toward the main lounge. My heart stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sean stood less than ten feet away, his tall frame unmistakable even in the dimly lit corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed to be heading toward the men&#39;s room, his normally precise movements slightly unsteady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five years melted away in an instant, and I felt as if all the oxygen had been sucked from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I instinctively retreated, planning to hide in the women&#39;s restroom until he passed. I had nearly reached the door when a strong hand gripped my shoulder, spinning me around and pinning me against the wall.</p>
