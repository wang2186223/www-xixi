                <p>In Colombia, the sun began to rise over the mountains, bathing the mansion in a soft light. As was his custom, Lorenzo said goodbye to his mother before leaving for the company. His relationship with her had always been complicated, but respect and obligation kept him close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Take care, son. See you later -his mother said with an affectionate smile, although her eyes didn&#39;t shine as they used to when it came to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo nodded, kissed her on the cheek, and left in a hurry, but before he reached the car, he remembered something important he had forgotten in his room. He decided to quickly go back for it, quietly, so as not to alarm his mother or Valeria. Despite the rush, something inside him told him he needed to do it. The document he had left behind was crucial for the meeting that morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He headed back to the house without making any noise, making sure no one saw him return. When he entered, everything seemed quiet. However, as he walked down the hallway, something caught his attention: the voices of his mother and Valeria were clearly coming from the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, he stopped, hiding behind a corner so he wouldn&#39;t be seen. He didn&#39;t want to intervene or listen to them, but curiosity pushed him to get a little closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t know what happened to Lorenzo -Valeria said in a frustrated tone-. How could he be so blind, mother? She was never right for him, and now, look where we are.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo felt a knot in his stomach. Although he didn&#39;t fully understand, something about his sister&#39;s words unsettled him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It was what I had to do -his mother replied, in a tone full of deep resentment-. If Lorenzo had made the right choice, he would never have had to deal with that woman. I always knew his loyalty would be with me, but... I never imagined he could be so manipulable. In the end, everything we did was for his own good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valeria let out a sigh, as if feeling relieved by her mother&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why didn&#39;t you do it sooner? Why did you wait so long to separate Amelia from him? -Valeria asked, as if she had been waiting for an answer that would justify everything that had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Because I didn&#39;t think I needed to, but after so much... when she felt so sure of herself, that&#39;s when her ego made her believe Lorenzo would live only for her -his mother replied with venom in her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo gritted his teeth as he heard those words. He knew his mother had never accepted Amelia, but hearing her speak so coldly about his wife filled him with indescribable rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-She never understood that everything I offered him was for his own good. I pretended to be sick, all so that he would stay by my side. And even though I told him I needed him, she never understood. All she cared about was herself. And when I finally realized that his love for me was being questioned, I couldn&#39;t allow it -his mother continued, her voice full of bitterness-. I was the one who kept him close, the one who made him stay. Amelia never understood that she had to give space to his family, to his mother. She was never willing to sacrifice for him, and he... he always believed me, not her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo felt like the world was crashing down on him. His mother&#39;s words hurt more than he had anticipated. He remembered the day Amelia had left, her eyes full of pain, and how he hadn&#39;t stopped her, because he had believed his mother. He had preferred to believe his mother, who had pretended to be sick, rather than trust his wife&#39;s explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I never understood how she couldn&#39;t see everything I offered him -his mother went on, her voice even harsher-. Sometimes I think it was because of her pride. If it had been different, everything would have been better. But she left, and that was the best decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo closed his eyes, feeling the pain pressing on his chest. It had been him who had chosen to believe his mother&#39;s lies. It had been him who had allowed Amelia to leave, without asking a single question, without seeking her side of the story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized he had been a fool, blind, preferring to listen to his mother&#39;s words instead of seeing the truth. The truth was that Amelia had been a victim of manipulation, of constant humiliation, in an environment that never accepted her, and he had been responsible for all of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning slowly, Lorenzo decided to leave without making a sound. He needed time to process what he had just heard. He didn&#39;t know how, but he had to get Amelia back. He needed to apologize, and above all, he needed to understand how he had allowed everything to reach this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With determined steps, Lorenzo left the mansion, leaving behind the heavy burden of his mother&#39;s words. The sun had already risen completely, bathing the streets with its golden light, while the city continued its course, unaware of everything he had just discovered in that moment. The murmur of everyday life seemed to show no compassion for what was happening inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each step he took toward the car seemed to take him further from the mansion, but at the same time, it brought him closer to the truth. The battle with his own family had just begun, and he didn&#39;t know how much he could take before he broke. The pain and confusion accompanied him, and the anger he had held in for years now threatened to spill over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew facing his mother and Valeria would be just the beginning, but beyond that, the greatest challenge was facing himself. The decisions he had made, the lies he had accepted without questioning, and the open wound that hurt him every time he remembered how he had let Amelia go without fighting for her. Although the road ahead wouldn&#39;t be easy, Lorenzo knew he couldn&#39;t continue living in ignorance. He had to rebuild what he had lost, even though, in his heart, he already felt it might not be enough.</p>
