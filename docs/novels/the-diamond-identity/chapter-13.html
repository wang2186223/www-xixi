                <p>Finally, he found her sitting in a chair by a window, away from the bustle of the other guests. The moonlight illuminated her wrinkled and serene face as she quietly watched the night. Mateo paused for a moment, nervous, but then moved forward with determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Excuse me -he said shyly, extending the dessert towards her-. I wanted to give you this. I&#39;m really sorry for bumping into you earlier... I didn&#39;t mean to be rude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elderly woman looked up, her gray eyes gleaming with surprise and tenderness as she saw the boy in front of her. Her smile, slow and warm, deepened the wrinkles on her face but also gave her an unexpected air of youth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Oh, dear -she replied softly, like a whisper-. You have nothing to apologize for. It was just a little accident. But I really appreciate your kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo, a bit relieved by the woman&#39;s response, handed her the dessert, and she took it with trembling but firm hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s a very lovely cake -the elderly woman commented-. You know, these used to be my favorites when I was young. My mother used to make them for me on special occasions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy smiled, glad that his gesture was appreciated. But what surprised him most was the warmth that had formed between them, as if they were connected in some way, despite barely knowing each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Would you like me to stay for a while? -Mateo asked, with his usual curiosity-. I don&#39;t like it when people are alone, and you seem to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elderly woman looked at him with eyes full of affection and nodded gently, pointing to the chair beside her. Mateo climbed up and settled in, his legs dangling off the edge of the chair, and watched her attentively as they began to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, the elderly woman leaned slightly toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You shouldn&#39;t be walking around alone here, little one. I&#39;ll take you to your mother -she said in a serious tone, standing up with more ease than Mateo had expected. Her posture was firm, and though she used a cane, it seemed she didn&#39;t need it as much as he had imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo nodded confidently and took her hand. The elderly woman guided him through the hall, avoiding tables and people, toward the place where she knew Margaret was. But as they got closer, the atmosphere changed. Mateo felt a tension in the air, and when he saw Margaret from a distance, he noticed that she also felt it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret, with her characteristic mask, was talking to some guests, but when their eyes met, her posture stiffened. Her heart began to beat faster, the pressure of the situation overwhelming her. How had Mateo ended up talking to this woman? Her protective instinct kicked in immediately, though she couldn&#39;t fully understand why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elderly woman stopped in front of Margaret, with a firm and penetrating gaze that cut through any barrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Here is your son -the elderly woman said, her voice sharp, devoid of the sweetness she had shown toward Mateo earlier-. You shouldn&#39;t leave him alone in such a crowded place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret felt a wave of tension run through her body. She pressed her lips tightly beneath her mask and leaned down toward her son, gripping his hand firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thank you for bringing him -she replied, her tone controlled, though the discomfort was evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elderly woman did not move. She watched Margaret for a few more seconds, as if she wanted to say something else, something hidden behind her wise and ancient eyes. The hardness in her face didn&#39;t disappear, and Margaret felt as if she were being judged in a way she couldn&#39;t fully understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s easy to hide behind a mask, dear -the elderly woman said, her words like soft knives-. But you can&#39;t hide from everything. Especially not from what really matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment made Margaret tense even more. The elderly woman seemed to know more than she let on, as if she could see beyond the facade Margaret had carefully built. Uncertainty flooded her, but she forced herself not to show any reaction beyond what was necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Margaret could respond, the elderly woman turned toward Mateo, and suddenly, her expression changed. The hardness disappeared, and an infinite warmth covered her once again. She bent slightly to be at his level and gently stroked his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s been a pleasure to meet you, little one. Take good care of yourself, and don&#39;t forget what I told you. You have a heart full of light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo smiled, once again feeling that inexplicable connection with the elderly woman, as she returned his smile, now full of love and tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thank you -the boy said-. I hope to see you again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elderly woman nodded and, after one last look full of affection, turned and slowly walked away. But instead of heading toward the exit, she vanished into the crowd of the hall, as if she had never been there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked at her son and then at the place where the elderly woman had disappeared. Something about that woman had deeply unsettled her. But she couldn&#39;t afford to lose her composure, not now. She gripped Mateo&#39;s hand tighter and leaned down toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Let&#39;s go, darling -she said softly, though her mind was still trapped in the intense interaction she had just experienced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked away, a sense of discomfort lingered in the air. Margaret couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that the elderly woman knew more than she had let on. And although she hadn&#39;t said anything specific, her words echoed strongly in her mind, planting a seed of doubt and confusion.</p>
