                <p>The boy smiled, pleased that his gesture was appreciated. But what surprised him the most was the warmth he felt between them, as if they were somehow connected, even though they barely knew each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Would you like me to stay for a while? -Mateo asked with his usual curiosity-. I don&#39;t like people being alone, and you seem to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elderly woman looked at him with affectionate eyes and nodded gently, pointing to the chair beside her. Mateo climbed up and got comfortable, his legs dangling from the edge of the chair, as he observed her closely while they began to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, the woman leaned slightly toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You shouldn&#39;t be wandering alone here, little one. I&#39;ll take you to your mother -she said seriously, standing up with more ease than Mateo had expected. Her posture was firm, and although she used a cane, it didn&#39;t seem like she truly needed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo nodded, trusting, and took her hand. The elderly woman guided him through the room, weaving between tables and people, heading to where she knew Margaret was. But as they got closer, the atmosphere changed. Mateo sensed a tension in the air, and when he spotted Margaret from a distance, he noticed she felt it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret, with her characteristic mask, was talking to some guests, but when her eyes landed on the elderly woman and her son, her posture stiffened. Her heart started to race, overwhelmed by the pressure of the situation. How had Mateo ended up talking to that woman? Her protective instinct kicked in, even though she didn&#39;t entirely understand why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elderly woman stopped in front of Margaret, her gaze firm and piercing, cutting through any barrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Here&#39;s your son -the elderly woman said, her voice sharp, devoid of the sweetness she had shown Mateo moments before-. You shouldn&#39;t leave him alone in a place full of strangers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret felt a wave of tension ripple through her body. She pressed her lips together beneath her mask and leaned toward her son, gripping his hand firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thank you for bringing him -she replied, her tone controlled, though her discomfort was evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elderly woman didn&#39;t move. She observed Margaret for a few more seconds, as if she wanted to say something else, something hidden behind her wise and aged eyes. The sternness in her expression didn&#39;t waver, and Margaret felt as though she was being judged in a way she couldn&#39;t fully comprehend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s easy to hide behind a mask, dear -the woman said, her words soft knives-. But you can&#39;t hide from everything. Especially not from what truly matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remark made Margaret tense up even more. The elderly woman seemed to know more than she let on, as if she could see beyond the carefully constructed facade Margaret had built. Uncertainty crept in, but she forced herself not to show any reaction beyond what was necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Margaret could respond, the elderly woman turned to Mateo, and suddenly, her expression changed. The harshness vanished, replaced by infinite warmth. She leaned slightly to his level and gently stroked his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s been a pleasure meeting you, little one. Take care, and don&#39;t forget what I told you. You have a heart full of light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo smiled, once again feeling that inexplicable connection with the woman, as she returned the smile, now filled with love and tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thank you -said the boy-. I hope to see you again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elderly woman nodded and, after a final affectionate glance, turned and slowly walked away. But instead of heading to the exit, she disappeared into the crowd, as if she had never been there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked at her son and then at the spot where the woman had vanished. Something about her deeply unsettled her. But she couldn&#39;t afford to lose her composure-not now. She tightened her grip on Mateo&#39;s hand and leaned toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Come on, darling -she said softly, though her mind was still trapped in the intense interaction she had just experienced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked away, a sense of unease lingered in the air. Margaret couldn&#39;t shake the impression that the elderly woman knew more than she had let on. And although she hadn&#39;t said anything concrete, her words echoed in Margaret&#39;s mind, planting a seed of doubt and confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret and Adrien stood in a corner of the room, speaking in low voices while Mateo played with some small decorative objects he had found on one of the tables. The atmosphere between them was relaxed, but both knew the evening was nearing its end, and Lorenzo&#39;s presence at the same event always loomed as a silent threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien, with his usual calm, leaned slightly toward Margaret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mateo has been very restless tonight -he commented, watching the boy, who, though smiling, couldn&#39;t stay still for long-. Maybe we should leave before things get complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret nodded. It had been a strange evening, with too many encounters that had left her uneasy. The interaction with the elderly woman still haunted her, and Lorenzo&#39;s unexpected approach made her feel like she was walking on a tightrope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they could decide what to do, a familiar figure approached them: Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his elegant demeanor and always-calculating gaze, Lorenzo walked directly toward Margaret, completely ignoring Adrien. There was something in his expression that hadn&#39;t been there before-something sharper, almost challenging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret -he said with a slight nod, his voice soft but laden with intent-. I wanted to say goodbye before leaving. It&#39;s been a pleasure having you here tonight. I hope we can continue collaborating in the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret observed him carefully, trying to maintain her composure. She knew Lorenzo didn&#39;t suspect anything about her true identity, but his presence always kept her on edge. She was about to respond when she noticed Lorenzo&#39;s gaze shift to Adrien, who stood at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien, ever courteous, extended his hand toward Lorenzo, offering a calm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-A pleasure seeing you again, Lorenzo. I hope everything is going well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo glanced down at Adrien&#39;s extended hand but made no effort to shake it. Instead, he raised his eyes to meet Adrien&#39;s, cold and filled with barely concealed tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s unnecessary -Lorenzo replied curtly, not moving a muscle. His short words fell like a stone between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gesture of rejection did not go unnoticed by anyone present. Margaret felt the growing discomfort between her and Adrien, while Lorenzo, without breaking eye contact, seemed to measure each of their reactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence hung over them for a moment. Margaret glanced at Adrien, whose eyes had lost some of their usual calm. She knew Lorenzo&#39;s simple act of refusing Adrien&#39;s handshake meant much more than it seemed. There was something there-something Lorenzo suspected or at least wanted them to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Lorenzo broke the silence, inclining his head slightly toward Margaret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, it&#39;s been a pleasure -he repeated with a smile that didn&#39;t reach his eyes-. We&#39;ll see each other soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret barely managed to respond, feeling a churn inside her. Lorenzo gave Adrien one last look before turning away and disappearing into the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Lorenzo was gone, the tension between Margaret and Adrien lingered in the air. Neither of them spoke for a moment, but they both knew things had shifted. Lorenzo&#39;s behavior, his coldness toward Adrien, was no coincidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Do you think he suspects? -Adrien asked in a low voice, his tone more serious than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret lowered her gaze to Mateo, who was playing, oblivious to it all, then looked back at Adrien.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t know -she replied, trying to suppress the knot forming in her stomach-. But we have to be more careful. If Lorenzo starts suspecting...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien nodded but said nothing more. They both knew the situation was delicate, and any mistake could be fatal. As Mateo continued playing innocently, Margaret and Adrien stood in silence, each lost in their own thoughts about what might come next.</p>
