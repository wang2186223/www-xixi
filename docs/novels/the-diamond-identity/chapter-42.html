                <p>Margaret was sitting across from Lorenzo in the small café in Paris, surrounded by the calm of the midday. The conversation flowed naturally between them, but inside her, the words she had been holding back for so long were pressing against her chest like a ticking time bomb ready to explode. The silence between them was comfortable, but there was something in the air that made her feel tenser than she would have liked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo, unaware of her inner turmoil, smiled as he told her something about his trip back to Colombia and his plans with the company. But Margaret couldn&#39;t focus on anything other than the weight of her secret. She knew that if she revealed it, everything would change. Everything she had built over this time, all the peace she had managed to find in her life, would crumble. If she told him the truth about who she really was, she wasn&#39;t sure she could handle Lorenzo&#39;s reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Is something wrong, Margaret? -asked Lorenzo, noticing that her gaze was more distant than usual. Margaret looked him in the eyes, searching for a way to steer the conversation, but something in his face showed her that he had already sensed that something wasn&#39;t right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-No, it&#39;s nothing -she replied with a tense smile, hoping he wouldn&#39;t insist. Sometimes, she wished she could be as honest with him as she used to be in the past, but the fear of rejection held her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo studied her for a moment, as if he could read between the lines. Margaret felt anxiety start to rise within her, but she forced herself to stay calm. She couldn&#39;t let him discover what she had been keeping silent for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, you know you can tell me anything. I&#39;ve always said that, right? -he said, with that confidence he always gave her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Margaret couldn&#39;t. She couldn&#39;t risk everything for something as uncertain as the truth. Deep down, she knew that if she told him what she really felt and what she had been hiding, she could lose everything she had with him. The love she felt for Lorenzo was so strong and deep that the idea that it could end with a simple mistake, a single poorly told secret, terrified her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I know -she replied softly, unable to look him in the eyes-. But there are things that sometimes it&#39;s better to leave them in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo leaned slightly toward her, trying to understand, but didn&#39;t press. Instead, he gave her a smile, as if he respected her space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-If you ever decide to tell me, I&#39;ll be here, without judging you -he said, unaware of what he was asking for. Margaret felt a knot in her stomach. She knew that if she ever decided to tell him the truth, the connection they shared would be tested in ways she couldn&#39;t foresee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, doubt tormented her. What would Lorenzo do if he discovered who she really was? Would he feel betrayed by the lie? Or worse, would she lose everything by hiding something so fundamental?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The café continued with its calm rhythm, and Margaret, although surrounded by the warmth of the city, felt more alone than ever. She couldn&#39;t get the thought out of her mind that, despite her efforts to keep her secret safe, something inside her was slowly crumbling. She knew the decisions she was making, the lies being woven around her identity, would never stop haunting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it didn&#39;t matter what she felt. She couldn&#39;t turn back. Not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo looked at her again, searching for any sign that something wasn&#39;t right, but Margaret gave him the best smile she could, fearful that if he looked any closer, he would see what was truly behind her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he didn&#39;t know was that, beyond the lies and secrets, Margaret had already made a decision: the love she felt for him, although real, could not overcome the fears that tormented her. Maybe one day she could be honest with him, but not at that moment, not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Would you like to go for a walk around the city? -Lorenzo asked, trying to lighten the mood, unaware of the internal storm she was living through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;d love to -Margaret replied, relieved by the change of subject. She took her coffee with both hands, closed her eyes for a moment, and prepared for the day that still lay ahead. Despite the unspoken words, despite the secret that consumed her, she tried not to let fear control her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as Lorenzo stood up to grab his coat, Margaret promised herself that she would move forward, that she would find a way to deal with her past without him discovering it. After all, she couldn&#39;t change what she had already done, but she could control what she did from now on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, all she had to do was enjoy the present, with all the doubts and fears that came with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The walk through the streets of Paris was just what they both needed. The cool breeze of the afternoon brushed their faces, and the hustle and bustle of the city gave them a sense of normalcy. Lorenzo walked by her side, enjoying every moment, but there was something in the way Margaret responded, in her prolonged silences, that he couldn&#39;t ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew there was something more, something she wasn&#39;t telling him. Their relationship, although growing stronger, was still fragile. The love between them, so intense, was being tainted by the shadow of a secret Margaret seemed to guard so jealously. And that worried him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they crossed the Pont des Arts, where tourists gathered to take photos and admire the view, Lorenzo decided he could wait no longer. He knew something wasn&#39;t right, and if he didn&#39;t ask now, it would torment him. He couldn&#39;t keep carrying that uncertainty, not when all he wanted was to be closer to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret-he said softly, stopping in front of her and taking her hands. His gaze, full of concern and affection, rested on her face-. I don&#39;t know you well, but I don&#39;t need to in order to know something is bothering you. What is really going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret stopped as well, feeling her heart beat loudly in her chest. She looked into Lorenzo&#39;s eyes, and a pang of pain struck her. She knew she couldn&#39;t hide it any longer, but at the same time, the fear of losing him, of destroying what they had rebuilt, paralyzed her. If she told him the truth, he might not understand it, he might reject her. And the last thing she wanted was to lose him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I can&#39;t tell you now, Lorenzo-she finally responded, lowering her gaze. The fear of his reaction took control of her voice. She felt small under his scrutiny, but she also knew she couldn&#39;t keep avoiding this conversation-. I promise I&#39;ll tell you someday, but not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo furrowed his brow, feeling a mixture of frustration and concern. He stepped closer to her, trying to capture her full attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why?-he asked with a sigh, gently squeezing her hands-. Why not now? You know I trust you, Margaret. If something is tormenting you, I want to be by your side to support you, not to push you away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret closed her eyes for a moment, struggling to keep the tears at bay. The truth she had been avoiding for so long began to take hold of her, and the words she didn&#39;t want to say to Lorenzo flooded her mind. But she knew that, although he wanted to help her, what she had to tell him was something so big, so dark, that it could destroy what was left of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What I have to tell you is... complicated-she said, her voice breaking. She turned to look at the city, seeking something to anchor her to reality-. It&#39;s not something I can tell you right away. If I told you now... it could damage what we have. It could change everything, Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo watched her in silence, his face filled with a mix of pain and understanding. He wanted to insist, to push her to open up, but he knew he couldn&#39;t force her to share something she wasn&#39;t ready to. His heart beat strongly as he saw how vulnerable she looked, but he also felt a strange calm knowing that, at some point, she would open up to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-If you can&#39;t tell me now, I understand-he responded gently, though his voice trembled slightly-. But I want you to know something, Margaret. No matter what it is. If you ever decide to trust me with that secret, I will be here. I won&#39;t judge you, and I won&#39;t leave you alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked at him, and for the first time in a long while, she saw the purity of his promise. She knew Lorenzo had changed, that now he was a man who not only desired her, but was also willing to stand by her no matter what. But still, the fear of what could happen if she revealed her secret kept her cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I appreciate it, Lorenzo-she finally said, her eyes shining with a mix of gratitude and sadness-. And someday, I will tell you. I just ask that you be patient. I need that, more than anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo nodded slowly, not pressing her further, but the uncertainty still lingered between them. He wanted to believe her, to trust that everything would turn out fine, but he couldn&#39;t shake the doubt that planted itself in his heart. How big was that secret? And what impact would it have on their relationship when he finally found out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Margaret felt a weight on her shoulders, a burden she couldn&#39;t share with him, not yet. She looked at him for a moment, observing his determined face, and wished with all her heart that she could free herself from the anguish she felt. But for now, she could only keep the secret, hoping that someday time would make it easier to tell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They continued walking, but the air between them was filled with unasked questions, an uncertain future, and the unspoken promise that, eventually, everything would be resolved.</p>
