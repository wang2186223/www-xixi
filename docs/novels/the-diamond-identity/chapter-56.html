                <p>The fresh morning air entered through the hospital window as the sunlight illuminated the room where Adrien and Luca rested. After days of uncertainty, both were ready to be discharged, but the excitement of recovery was mixed with concern for what lay ahead. The doctors had been clear: both Adrien and Luca needed time, lots of care, and, above all, rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor entered the room with his typical serious expression, but with a slight smile that eased some of the tension that had been present over the past few days. He carried a folder with the final results of the two patients and, although both were much better, the gravity of the procedure was far from forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Adrien, Luca, you&#39;re both in good condition to leave. -The doctor spoke firmly but with that professional calmness that reassured anyone. -However, you must follow all instructions to the letter to avoid any complications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca was sitting on the bed with a timid smile, still weak but much more animated than before. Adrien, on the other hand, looked a bit paler than usual, but the color was already returning to his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What kind of care do they need? -asked Ana, who hadn&#39;t stopped watching them the entire time. Though she didn&#39;t show it, her worry was as great as any mother&#39;s. She was afraid that everything they had gone through wasn&#39;t enough, that everything might fall apart again if something went wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor took out a list of recommendations and began to enumerate them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Adrien, you must avoid any type of physical exertion in the coming days. No intense activity, just light walking every day and plenty of rest. The surgery for the bone marrow donation was extensive, so your body needs time to recover. Also, make sure to strictly follow the medication schedule to avoid infections or complications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And Luca? -Ana asked, looking at the little boy, who now seemed a bit more cheerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Luca also needs similar care. Although his body is responding well to the donated marrow, he must remain calm. The first few days will be crucial to avoid any kind of relapse. -The doctor gave Ana a serious look. -Make sure he gets enough rest and avoid any situation that could disturb his well-being. Keep him in a calm and stress-free environment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana nodded, mentally taking note of every word the doctor said. She wasn&#39;t going to leave them for a single moment and was preparing to be their unconditional support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the doctor left, Adrien was lost in thought. He knew there was a lot of work to do to fully recover, but what worried him the most was how he was going to face everything in his current state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-So, where do we go after this? -Adrien asked Ana, with a faint smile that barely hid his exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana looked at him, and her eyes showed something more than just tiredness. It had been a difficult situation, but now that he was better, she felt the need to take the next step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-The best thing is for you to stay with me and Luca. -Ana said, firmly but also with a softness only he could understand. -You&#39;ll recover much better at home, surrounded by peace. I&#39;ll take care of everything, I don&#39;t want you to worry anymore. You&#39;re not 100% yet, Adrien. And the last thing I want is for you to feel alone during this process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien remained silent for a moment, as if processing her words. He never imagined he&#39;d live with Ana again, much less under these circumstances. It wasn&#39;t the life he had planned, but something inside him told him he needed to trust her, that he needed to be close to Luca, that it was what mattered most right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t want to be a burden to you, Ana. -he finally said, his voice still weak. -But I don&#39;t know, maybe you&#39;re right. It could be the best, at least until I fully recover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana smiled, though her smile carried a mix of emotions she couldn&#39;t completely express. There was much to heal between them, too many things left unsaid, too many memories floating between them. But, for now, she only focused on what was in front of her: her son, Adrien, and the uncertain future they would have to face together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You&#39;re not a burden, Adrien. And you don&#39;t have to do it all alone. -she said, moving a little closer and gently touching his arm. -I don&#39;t want you to face this alone. Not after everything that&#39;s happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien looked at her, his eyes full of gratitude but also confusion. He was grateful for her support, but he still didn&#39;t know what would happen next. Would they go back to how they were before? Could there be something more between them in the future?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thank you, Ana. Really. -his voice trembled slightly, as if realizing how much he needed her support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled at him again, that smile filled with a sweetness she rarely showed but that felt sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-We&#39;ll start again, step by step. First, I&#39;ll take care of you, then we&#39;ll see what happens with the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation hung in the air, but the words were enough for both of them. Ana&#39;s home, with its peace and with Luca, would be the place where they would begin to heal, to face everything they had left to live. One day at a time, together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the waiting room, Ana received the news that everything was ready to leave. As she watched Adrien prepare to leave the hospital, the feeling that, despite everything they had been through, there was a chance to start over grew stronger. And though uncertainty surrounded them, at that moment, the only thing that mattered was that they would be together, at least for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked toward the hospital exit, Adrien couldn&#39;t help but look at Ana and Luca, realizing that this was the beginning of something bigger, something neither of them could predict but that was there, waiting for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both knew they had to be strong. But for the first time in a long time, Adrien allowed himself to feel hope.</p>
