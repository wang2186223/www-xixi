                <p>The day after the event, Lorenzo was in his office reviewing company documents. Although he tried to focus, his mind kept drifting back to the previous evening. Something about Margaret intrigued him deeply, though he couldn&#39;t figure out what. The interaction with Adrien hadn&#39;t gone unnoticed either. There was something in their relationship that stirred a mixture of distrust and curiosity within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Lorenzo went over some reports, his personal assistant, Clara, knocked on the door and entered with a folder in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mr. Lorenzo, the organizers of last night&#39;s event just called. They insist on speaking with you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo looked up, surprised by the urgency in Clara&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Did they say what it&#39;s about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-They mentioned something about an important discovery -Clara replied-. They think you should know about it immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo nodded and took the phone that Clara handed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo speaking. What&#39;s going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end of the line, the event coordinator&#39;s voice sounded serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mr. Lorenzo, sorry to bother you, but we found something while cleaning up after last night&#39;s event. It&#39;s a wedding ring with engravings that we think are important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo furrowed his brow, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-A wedding ring? What does that have to do with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What&#39;s strange, sir, is that the engravings have the names &#34;Lorenzo&#34; and &#34;Amelia.&#34; We thought it might be yours or someone close to you, since both names match. We thought it would be wise to inform you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo&#39;s heart skipped a beat. The mention of &#34;Amelia&#34; hit him like a slap in the face. It had been years since that name had been a part of his daily life, and although he still loved her as much as the first day, his wife had disappeared. He never imagined that something related to her would show up at an event like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Are you sure about the engravings? -he asked, his tone sharper than intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Completely, sir. We have the ring here, and if you want, you can come pick it up. We also wanted to confirm if your wife was present at the event, as we think the ring might belong to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo stayed silent for a moment, his mind racing. Amelia couldn&#39;t have been there; she had disappeared three years ago. Also, Margaret, the star designer he was collaborating with, was the main guest, not Amelia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-No, my wife wasn&#39;t at the event -he replied finally, trying to control his tone-. But I&#39;ll come by to pick up the ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Perfect, sir. We&#39;ll be waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo hung up, but his mind was still full of questions. How had a ring with those engravings ended up at the event? And why now, in the middle of all the chaos he was facing with his company?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to get answers, he grabbed his coat and headed toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Clara, cancel my meetings for this morning -he said as he passed by his assistant-. I have something important to attend to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he drove toward the event venue, he couldn&#39;t stop thinking about Margaret. There was something about her that felt too familiar, like every interaction with her was tied to a memory he couldn&#39;t reach. Now, with the discovery of the ring, a crazy idea began to form in his mind, but he dismissed it immediately. Amelia couldn&#39;t be Margaret... could she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he arrived at the venue, Lorenzo was determined to uncover the truth, even though he wasn&#39;t prepared for the answers waiting for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arriving at the organizers&#39; offices, he was greeted by Miguel, who led him to a small private room. On the glass table sat a small black box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Here it is, Mr. Lorenzo -Miguel said, opening the box and showing him the ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo took it carefully, examining the engraving inside: Lorenzo &amp; Amelia. His heart stopped for a moment. It was the same ring, no doubt about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Where did you find it? -he asked, his voice quieter than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It was in a corner of the hall, under a table. We think someone might have dropped it accidentally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Do you have security footage? -Lorenzo inquired, now fully focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel nodded and handed over a folder with photos of the footage. Lorenzo quickly flipped through them, pausing at an image showing a woman in a mask approaching one of the display cases. Although her face wasn&#39;t fully visible, something about her posture and the way she moved felt familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Who is she? -he asked, pointing at the image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-That&#39;s Margaret, the star designer of the exhibition -Miguel replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo felt a chill run down his spine. Everything was starting to connect in his mind, but the pieces still didn&#39;t fit together. If Margaret owned the ring, what connection could she have to Amelia?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thank you for informing me -Lorenzo said, putting the ring in his pocket-. I&#39;ll take care of clearing this up personally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he left the building, his mind was full of questions. Margaret and Amelia... could it be that there was something between them that he didn&#39;t know? Or could... they be the same person?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought hit him like lightning, leaving him frozen in place. If it were true, it would mean everything he thought he knew was about to change forever.</p>
