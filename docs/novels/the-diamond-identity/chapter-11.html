                <p>chapter was about to begin, one that could change their lives forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jewelry exhibition was filled with dazzling lights and murmurs of admiration as guests walked around the displayed pieces. Amelia, still wearing her mask, felt trapped in a web of emotions. She knew facing Lorenzo was inevitable, but she hadn&#39;t expected to also run into Isabel, her ex-mother-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Lorenzo focused on presenting the new pieces, Mateo had managed to slip away from Adrien when he wasn&#39;t paying attention. The little boy, full of curiosity, ventured through the hall, admiring the colors and sparkles of the surrounding jewelry. Without realizing where he was headed, he found himself in the center of the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Mateo bumped into an imposing figure. Isabel, moving with the grace of a woman accustomed to being the center of attention, stopped dead when she felt the impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Ouch! -Isabel exclaimed, looking at the child in disbelief. Her surprise quickly turned into confusion and, finally, fear. The resemblance between Mateo and Lorenzo was striking, and the image of her son&#39;s face flooded her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo, stunned by the collision, looked up. -I&#39;m sorry! -he said sincerely, not knowing who he had bumped into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabel stood frozen, unable to take her eyes off the child. Something in his eyes and his laughter stirred memories she had buried, and her heart began to race. She felt uneasy, as if a forbidden truth was staring her in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Who are you? -Isabel asked, her voice trembling slightly as she tried to control her shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo, confused, shrugged. -I&#39;m Mateo. I&#39;m just playing here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabel felt a shiver run down her spine. Mateo that name echoed in her mind like a reminder of a past she couldn&#39;t ignore. &#34;It can&#39;t be,&#34; she thought, unable to accept the idea that this child, who seemed so small and vulnerable, could be connected to her son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mateo? -Isabel repeated, her voice barely a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo, unaware of the impact of his name, smiled innocently. -Yes, do you like my toys? -he said, holding up a small toy train in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabel&#39;s heart sank further as she saw the similarity between the train and the one Lorenzo had had as a child. Her mind was in a whirlwind. &#34;No, it can&#39;t be,&#34; she thought, struggling to keep her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo, who had been talking to other guests, sensed that something was wrong when he saw his mother standing there, in shock, staring at Mateo. He approached, wondering what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What&#39;s going on, Mom? -Lorenzo asked, noticing the paleness in Isabel&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to him, still staring at Mateo. -This child he looks so much like you. It&#39;s strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo, sensing the tension in the air, looked at Lorenzo curiously. -Is she your mom? -he asked, innocent and happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabel, unable to contain herself any longer, crouched down and moved toward the boy, but instead of feeling comforted by the connection, her heart filled with panic. -No, you shouldn&#39;t be here -she said, her voice firmer than she intended. The idea that Lorenzo had a child in secret terrified her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why? -Mateo asked, confused by the woman&#39;s reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo stepped between them, his worried expression growing more intense. -What&#39;s going on here? -he asked, but his mother ignored him, focusing solely on the child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Who is your mother? -Isabel asked, trying to control her voice, but feeling the truth slipping away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo, not understanding the seriousness of the situation, smiled innocently. -I don&#39;t know. I just know I like to play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabel felt a knot in her stomach. She turned to Lorenzo, searching for answers, but he was just as confused. Not knowing that Mateo was his son, the pain in his eyes was evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mom, this doesn&#39;t make sense -Lorenzo said, feeling increasingly frustrated. He didn&#39;t understand the connection his mother seemed to see, but something in Mateo&#39;s face unsettled him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the air was palpable. Isabel looked at Mateo once more, feeling that every feature of the child brought her closer to a truth she didn&#39;t want to accept. -You shouldn&#39;t be here, child -she finally said, turning away, her heart racing and her mind clouded with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo, watching his mother walk away, felt a shadow fall over him. Something was wrong. There was something in the connection between her and this child that he couldn&#39;t understand, but the fear in Isabel&#39;s expression unsettled him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Mateo stood there, confused and looking around, Amelia reappeared, searching for her son. Seeing Lorenzo with the child, her heart raced. She approached quickly, recognizing the discomfort in the atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What happened? -she asked, her gaze fixed on Mateo, who smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t know, but I think Mom got scared -Lorenzo replied, feeling more and more overwhelmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia felt a pang of worry shoot through her. She knew the moment of truth was approaching, and that her past was intertwining with the present in ways they could no longer ignore.</p>
