                <p>The sun filtered timidly through the windows of Margaret&#39;s spacious living room. The day began with deceptive calm, but Margaret knew it was only the calm before the storm. The confrontation with Clarisse the day before had ignited a spark within her: she wasn&#39;t willing to back down, but she also couldn&#39;t let her guard down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Mateo played with a puzzle on the rug, Margaret reviewed her pending designs. Work was the only thing that distracted her. Yet, a persistent thought haunted her: how far would Clarisse go?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the doorbell snapped her out of her thoughts. Margaret stood and opened the door. It was her assistant, Chloe, holding a package and looking concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-This just arrived for you, Mrs. Margaret -said Chloe, handing her the envelope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret took it cautiously. There was no sender, but the seal was from a well-known Paris courier. Opening it, she found a series of photographs. They showed her walking with Mateo in various parts of the city: the park, a café, a toy store. The last image was a close-up of Mateo with a handwritten note on the back: &#34;Secrets always come to light.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret felt her blood run cold. Her first thought was that Clarisse was behind it, but could she really dare to threaten Mateo so blatantly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Are you alright, ma&#39;am? -asked Chloe, noticing her pale face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret took a deep breath and forced a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes, everything&#39;s fine. Thank you, Chloe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once her assistant left, Margaret locked the door and leaned against it, looking at the photographs again. Anger and fear mixed inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clarisse, this is too much, she thought, clenching her fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With coffee still warm in her hand, she checked her email. Her correspondence with Lorenzo had remained strictly professional, but now she felt the need to break that barrier. Clarisse wasn&#39;t just investigating her; she seemed to have set her sights on Mateo. Lorenzo needed to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up her phone and dialed Lorenzo&#39;s number. He answered almost immediately, his voice firm but surprised by the early call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret. This is unexpected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo -she said directly-. This can&#39;t wait. I need to speak with you urgently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Is there a problem with the designs? -he asked, concern creeping into his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-This has nothing to do with the company -she replied, her voice trembling slightly-. It&#39;s personal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause on the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to stay calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;d rather not discuss this over the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m in Colombia. It&#39;s hard for me to travel right now. But if it&#39;s that urgent, tell me what you need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret hesitated before answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Clarisse is crossing boundaries I didn&#39;t expect. She&#39;s investigating me, Lorenzo. She&#39;s even trying to find out who Mateo&#39;s father is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence filled the line. Lorenzo didn&#39;t need clarification; he knew who she was referring to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What? -his voice was cold and disbelieving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I confronted her yesterday, but today I received photos of Mateo and me walking around Paris. Lorenzo, I don&#39;t know how far she&#39;s willing to go, but this is no longer just between her and me. This affects my son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo didn&#39;t respond immediately. Margaret could hear his deep breaths as he tried to contain his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;ll handle this -he finally said, his tone low but determined-. Clarisse has no right to involve you or Mateo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I hope so -Margaret replied, trying to keep her voice steady-. But if this continues, Lorenzo, I won&#39;t hesitate to take action and cancel the collaboration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I understand -he said-. Please, don&#39;t do anything until I talk to her. And, Margaret...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Take care of Mateo. And yourself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret closed her eyes, breathing deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I always do -she replied before ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Bogotá, Lorenzo threw his phone onto his desk, his face tense as he processed the conversation. He had known Clarisse was ambitious, even manipulative, but he hadn&#39;t imagined she would go this far. For the first time in years, he felt the control he had fought to maintain slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in Paris, Margaret prepared for the day with renewed determination. If Lorenzo didn&#39;t act soon, she would face Clarisse herself. Her son was her world, and she wouldn&#39;t allow anyone, not even someone as dangerous as Clarisse, to put him at risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo dialed Clarisse&#39;s number with steady hands, though his expression betrayed the anger simmering inside him. The line barely rang twice before she picked up, her tone sweet and carefree as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo! What a pleasant surprise to hear from you so early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Clarisse -he said, his voice sharp-. We need to talk. Now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tone of his voice made her tense immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What&#39;s wrong? Did something happen with Margaret?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Exactly that, Clarisse. You happened with Margaret -he replied, his tone rising slightly-. I trusted you to handle this collaboration professionally, but what you&#39;ve been doing is far from that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What are you talking about? -she asked, trying to sound innocent-. I&#39;m just making sure everything goes perfectly for the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Perfectly? -Lorenzo let out a bitter laugh-. Since when does investigating Margaret&#39;s personal life, stalking her, and prying into her son&#39;s parentage fall under your responsibilities?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence on the other end was brief but enough for Lorenzo to know he had cornered her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I was only... trying to protect you, Lorenzo. That woman isn&#39;t trustworthy. We don&#39;t even know who she really is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I didn&#39;t ask you to judge her, Clarisse -he snapped-. I asked you to represent me, to handle this relationship with respect and professionalism. Instead, you&#39;ve crossed lines you had no right to cross.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo, please don&#39;t get upset -she tried to soften her tone-. Everything I do is for your sake. That woman... she...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Enough! -he interrupted, his patience gone-. Pack your things and return to Colombia immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What? -Clarisse exclaimed, incredulous-. Are you removing me from the project?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes, Clarisse. This is the end. You&#39;ve proven you can&#39;t handle this responsibility. And since I can&#39;t trust you, I can&#39;t let you continue in this role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo, please. You can&#39;t do this to me. I&#39;ve been loyal to you, to the company...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And I was loyal to you -he cut her off again, his voice low but filled with anger-. But I can&#39;t allow your unprofessional behavior to jeopardize this collaboration, let alone let your actions affect an innocent child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clarisse remained silent, processing his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-This isn&#39;t over -she finally said, her tone venomous-. What you&#39;re doing is unfair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-No, Clarisse. What you did was unfair. This is just the consequence of your actions. And let me warn you: if you try anything else against Margaret or her son, I&#39;ll take legal action. Am I clear?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Crystal clear -she replied coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo didn&#39;t say another word. He simply ended the call, leaving Clarisse alone with her rage and humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he leaned against his desk, Lorenzo felt a strange mix of relief and exhaustion. He had drawn a line, something he had never done with his mother or sister. But the biggest challenge still lay ahead, in Paris, with Margaret and the truth he wasn&#39;t ready to face.</p>
