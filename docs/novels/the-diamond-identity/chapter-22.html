                <p>Margaret walked with firm steps toward the parking lot exit, her heels echoing against the concrete. Her breathing was rapid as she tried to suppress the frustration Lorenzo had stirred in her. He caught up with her quickly, his imposing figure stopping her with a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Margaret,&#34; he said in a serious but controlled tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t respond, not even turning around. Lorenzo quickened his pace, stepping in front of her to block her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Margaret asked, clearly annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m taking you back,&#34; he said, crossing his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me?&#34; she snapped, raising an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have a way to get back. I brought you here, and I&#39;m not leaving you behind,&#34; he explained, his voice maintaining a tone of forced calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret let out a bitter laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you decide when I can leave too? Don&#39;t make me laugh, Lorenzo. I can call a taxi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t,&#34; he replied swiftly, taking a step closer. His gaze was intense, filled with emotions he tried to hide. &#34;I won&#39;t let you go back alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She studied him for a moment, searching his face for any sign of a joke, but found none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you care?&#34; she finally asked in a defiant tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo took a deep breath, trying to keep his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I want to make sure you get home safely. That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret narrowed her eyes at him. Something about him unsettled her, but she couldn&#39;t pinpoint what it was. Finally, she let out an exasperated sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, Lorenzo. I&#39;ll go with you, but let&#39;s be clear-this doesn&#39;t change anything,&#34; she said, walking toward the car without waiting for a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo followed her in silence. Once inside the car, the atmosphere grew tense. The engine roared as it started, and Lorenzo maneuvered out of the parking lot. The first few minutes passed in awkward silence, broken only by the sound of tires on pavement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you always this controlling, or is it just with me?&#34; Margaret asked suddenly, breaking the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo cast a brief glance at her before focusing back on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not controlling. I just want to do things right,&#34; he said seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do things right?&#34; Margaret repeated sarcastically. &#34;Don&#39;t make me laugh. You always try to impose your rules, Lorenzo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip on the steering wheel tightened, but his tone remained calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not imposing anything. If it bothers you that I care about you, that&#39;s your problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret scoffed and turned to look out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need you to care about me. I&#39;m used to handling things on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo let her words hang in the air before speaking again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you always been alone?&#34; he asked, his voice softer this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret turned her head toward him, surprised by the change in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of question is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo paused, as if carefully choosing his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just trying to understand you. Have you ever given someone the chance to truly be with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret stared at him, her eyes flashing with something Lorenzo couldn&#39;t quite decipher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not talking about my personal life with you,&#34; she replied coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret glanced at him out of the corner of her eye but said nothing. The rest of the drive continued in silence, both of them lost in their thoughts, aware that something had shifted between them, though neither dared to admit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car moved slowly through streets illuminated by city lights. Inside, the tension was palpable but not unbearable. Lorenzo kept his gaze fixed on the road, while Margaret looked distractedly out the window, as if every corner sparked a memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the ringing of Lorenzo&#39;s phone shattered the silence. He pulled it from his pocket and glanced at the screen. It was a call from Diego, his general manager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me a moment,&#34; Lorenzo said, turning on the speaker while keeping one hand on the wheel. &#34;Diego, what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the other end was firm, almost urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Lorenzo, we need you to return to Colombia as soon as possible. Critical matters have come up that require your presence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo frowned, his previously relaxed expression hardening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What matters?&#34; he asked, casting a brief glance at Margaret, who seemed interested in the conversation despite trying not to show it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are important meetings with the investors. The financial situation remains delicate, and some partners want clear answers about the company&#39;s future. Also, your prolonged absence is starting to worry them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo pressed his lips together, feeling a mix of irritation and responsibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been handling everything remotely. I don&#39;t see why they can&#39;t wait a few more days,&#34; he replied dryly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With all due respect, sir, your presence is indispensable. You know how the partners are-they need to see you to feel reassured.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret turned her gaze from the window to Lorenzo, watching him closely. His face was tense, but his posture remained firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand, Diego,&#34; Lorenzo finally replied. &#34;I&#39;ll send a message tonight with the details of my return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect. Thank you, sir. See you soon,&#34; Diego concluded before hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car fell silent again. Lorenzo put the phone back in his pocket and let out a long sigh, as if the call had drained what energy he had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trouble in paradise?&#34; Margaret asked, breaking the silence with a light but pointed tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo let out a small, sarcastic laugh without taking his eyes off the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing I can&#39;t handle,&#34; he said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret crossed her arms, watching him with a mix of curiosity and caution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your company seems pretty demanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s what happens when you have investors who think they can run things better than you. Sometimes I wonder if all the effort is worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret raised an eyebrow, surprised by his comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo took a few seconds to respond, as if weighing the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now, yes,&#34; he finally said, though there was something in his tone that hinted at doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the drive continued in an uneasy calm, interrupted only by the sound of the engine and occasional traffic. When they arrived in front of Margaret&#39;s house, Lorenzo turned off the car and faced her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, here we are,&#34; he said with a slight smile that didn&#39;t quite reach his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret grabbed her purse and reached for the door handle but paused before getting out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you find what you&#39;re looking for when you go back,&#34; she said, looking directly into his eyes for the first time that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo tilted his head, as if trying to decipher the meaning behind her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; he replied, his voice low and almost serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a slight nod and stepped out of the car without looking back. Lorenzo watched her walk to the door until she disappeared inside. Only then did he restart the engine, though he didn&#39;t drive off immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, Diego&#39;s words mingled with Margaret&#39;s. Too many things were at stake, too many moving pieces, and time seemed to be slipping through his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you doing, Lorenzo?&#34; he murmured to himself before accelerating into the night.</p>
