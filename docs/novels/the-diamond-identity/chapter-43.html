                <p>Margaret and Lorenzo walked through the cobblestone streets of Paris, sharing small moments of conversation. The air was heavy, as if the storm that was approaching mirrored the emotions they were both trying to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Margaret&#39;s phone began to vibrate. When she looked at the screen, she saw that it was Adrien.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Adrien?-she answered, her tone reflecting her surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, I&#39;m sorry to bother you, but I need you to come back soon. Something urgent came up, and I have to leave immediately-Adrien said in a serious tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What happened? Is everything okay?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes, don&#39;t worry. But I can&#39;t stay with Mateo much longer. Could you come back home?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret sighed, thankful that Adrien was being honest, though his request was unexpected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Of course, I&#39;ll be there in a few minutes. Thanks for looking after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Always, Margaret. See you soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she hung up, Lorenzo had already noticed the change in her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Is something wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-No, but I have to go back home. Adrien has to leave, and Mateo is with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;ll come with you-Lorenzo said without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked at him for a moment, wanting to decline the offer, but the determination in his eyes made her not insist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Alright-she agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trip back home was quicker than they had expected, but just as they arrived, the sky darkened completely. Adrien was waiting at the entrance, with Mateo asleep in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thanks for coming so quickly-Adrien said, carefully handing the child over to Margaret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Are you sure everything&#39;s okay?-she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien nodded, but his gaze seemed to avoid Lorenzo&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes, don&#39;t worry. Something came up that I couldn&#39;t postpone. Thanks for understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief exchange, Adrien said a quick &#34;see you&#34; and disappeared into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret took Mateo to his room, gently tucking him into bed before returning to the living room. There, she found Lorenzo standing by the window, watching as the rain began to fall heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be able to return to the hotel -Margaret commented, crossing her arms as she watched the lightning light up the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It doesn&#39;t look like this storm will let up anytime soon -Lorenzo replied, turning towards her with a slight smile-. Do you mind if I stay?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret shook her head, although her heart was pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Of course not. Just give me a moment to prepare the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-There&#39;s no need. I&#39;m fine here with you -he said, his tone soft, making her stop in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The electricity from the storm seemed to transfer into the air between them. Margaret looked at him, trying to decipher his intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo, I don&#39;t know if this is a good idea...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, don&#39;t worry about what I think or don&#39;t think. I&#39;m here because I want to be, not for any other reason -he replied, taking a step toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked away, feeling how the barriers she had built began to wobble. But before she could respond, a loud thunderclap rang out, making her jump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo laughed softly, trying to ease the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Looks like tonight&#39;s going to be a long one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, the storm had eased, but the clouds still covered the sky, as if Paris didn&#39;t want to let go of the intimate atmosphere that had been created the night before. Lorenzo woke up early, something unusual for him, but the presence of Mateo in the house gave him a curious sense of responsibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Margaret prepared breakfast, Lorenzo decided to take the time to get closer to the little one. He found him in the living room, playing with a wooden train that seemed to have lost some pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Can I play with you? -Lorenzo asked, kneeling beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo looked at him cautiously at first, but then nodded, extending one of the train pieces to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You have to fix it. The train can&#39;t keep going if you don&#39;t -he said seriously, as if truly entrusting him with an important mission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo smiled and pretended to concentrate hard as he tried to fit the pieces together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I think this one goes here... or maybe not. What do you think?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo let out a small laugh and took the piece from his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-No, it doesn&#39;t go like that. Look, this is how mom does it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment made Lorenzo look up, seeing Margaret from a distance, watching them from the kitchen with a smile she was trying to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Your mom seems to know a lot of things -Lorenzo commented, looking at Mateo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yeah, mom knows everything. But she doesn&#39;t always play with me because she works a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo felt a pang of empathy for the little one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Well, today you have someone else to play with, okay?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo nodded enthusiastically, and for the next hour, Lorenzo immersed himself in the world of wooden trains, following the instructions from his little &#34;master.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Margaret entered the living room with a tray of juice and cookies, she stopped when she saw the scene. Lorenzo and Mateo were lying on the carpet, with train tracks scattered across almost the entire room. Mateo was talking non-stop, explaining to Lorenzo how the trains&#39; &#34;schedules&#34; worked, and Lorenzo listened with a patience and attention he had never shown before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I see the living room turned into a train station -Margaret commented, trying to sound casual as she placed the tray on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mom, look at what we made! -Mateo exclaimed, pointing to the complex structure they had built together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s impressive, sweetheart. You&#39;ve done a great job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo slowly stood up, wiping his hands on his pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I think your son has a talent for engineering -he joked, looking at Margaret with a soft expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And it looks like he found someone willing to keep up with him -she replied, unable to stop herself from smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, while Mateo took a nap, Lorenzo and Margaret sat on the small terrace of the house, having coffee under the cloudy sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-He&#39;s a good kid -Lorenzo said, breaking the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret nodded, looking toward the living room where her son rested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes, he is. He&#39;s been through a lot for his young age, but he&#39;s strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You can tell. And you can also tell he has an incredible mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret blushed slightly, looking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thank you for spending time with him. I think he likes you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo smiled, leaning back in his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s mutual. There&#39;s something about him that... I don&#39;t know, it just makes me feel at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked at him, wanting to ask more, but decided against it. There was something in Lorenzo&#39;s tone that made her think that, perhaps, he too felt a deeper connection than he was willing to admit.</p>
