                <p>The constant roar of the car&#39;s engine filled the uncomfortable silence between Lorenzo and Margaret as they drove down the highway. The atmosphere was tense, heavy with unspoken words and avoided glances. Lorenzo, his face serious and hands steady on the wheel, broke the silence with a question that had been lingering in his mind for some time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, can I ask you a personal question?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She, distracted while looking out the window, slightly turned her head toward him, her eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-That depends on how personal it is -she replied cautiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo took a deep breath, as if gathering courage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s about Adrien.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name hung in the air, and Margaret felt a pang of discomfort. She narrowed her eyes, anticipating what was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What about Adrien? -she asked, trying to sound indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo tapped his fingers on the steering wheel, clearly nervous but determined to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I was wondering is Adrien Mateo&#39;s biological father?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air seemed to freeze inside the car. Margaret stared at him, her lips slightly parted in surprise. An instant later, her expression shifted to a mix of indignation and restrained fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Excuse me? -she asked coldly, her tone sharp as a blade-. What kind of question is that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo briefly took his eyes off the road to glance at her, a mix of regret and determination in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s a reasonable doubt, Margaret. Adrien is very present in your life, and Mateo...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Enough! -she interrupted, raising her voice slightly-. Lorenzo, you have no right to ask me such a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo frowned but kept his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m just trying to understand...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret let out a dry laugh, full of disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Understand what, Lorenzo? What does Adrien or my son have to do with our collaboration? We&#39;re working together, and that does not give you permission to pry into my personal life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed his lips together, visibly irritated by her reaction but unwilling to escalate the argument further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I didn&#39;t mean to offend you -he said, his tone softer but still serious-. But when you work with someone, it&#39;s inevitable to want to know more about their life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Well, I&#39;m not interested in sharing mine with you -Margaret replied bluntly, crossing her arms-. My life, my decisions, and my family are none of your business, and I don&#39;t need to justify anything to you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo kept his eyes on the road, his hands tense on the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It wasn&#39;t my intention to overstep -he said after a long silence-. But there&#39;s something about all of this that doesn&#39;t add up, Margaret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Then get over it -she snapped, turning back to the window-. We&#39;re here to work, not to talk about my personal matters. The only thing that connects us is this collaboration, and you&#39;d better focus on that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the drive passed in heavy silence, broken only by the hum of the engine and the faint murmur of the music Lorenzo had turned on to fill the void.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they reached their destination, Lorenzo turned off the engine and slowly turned toward Margaret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I didn&#39;t mean to make you uncomfortable, Margaret. Truly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him, her face hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You did, Lorenzo. And I hope it&#39;s clear that questions like this won&#39;t happen again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret opened the car door and got out quickly, leaving Lorenzo sitting there, thoughtful, with a frustrated expression on his face. There was something about her that intrigued and baffled him in equal measure. But for now, he would have to learn to keep his distance-at least until the pieces of this complex puzzle began to fit together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo watched Margaret as she walked away with firm steps, her silhouette reflecting the mix of determination and anger still lingering in the air. He closed his eyes for a moment, leaning his head against the seatback, as if trying to shake off the weight of his thoughts. He couldn&#39;t help it. There was something about Margaret that pulled him toward memories he&#39;d buried long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he got out of the car and caught up with her at the entrance of the building where they had a scheduled meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret -he called, keeping his voice low to avoid aggravating the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped but didn&#39;t turn, her body tense like a rope about to snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What? -she said without looking at him, her tone dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m sorry -he began, with palpable sincerity-. It wasn&#39;t my intention to cross a line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret sighed, her shoulders relaxing slightly. Finally, she turned to him, though her gaze remained hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo, I&#39;m here to work. If we mix personal matters, this won&#39;t work. Understood?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Understood -he replied, though his eyes reflected a swirl of emotions he couldn&#39;t fully control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret nodded, closing the topic. They entered the building in silence, like two strangers sharing a space purely by chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours later, as the meeting ended, Margaret was gathering her papers in silence while Lorenzo watched her from across the room. His mind kept circling back to their earlier conversation. Though she had been clear, he couldn&#39;t ignore the connection he still felt or the questions that had haunted him since Adrien revealed her true identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, as they both stepped into the parking lot, Lorenzo broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped and looked at him, weary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I know I said I wouldn&#39;t interfere in your personal life, and I&#39;ll respect that. But I just need you to answer something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret closed her eyes for a second, trying to stay calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What&#39;s so important it can&#39;t wait?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo stepped closer, keeping his voice low and firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why is Adrien so involved with you and Mateo?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret felt the ground shift beneath her feet. Her hands clenched the papers she held, but she maintained her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Because he&#39;s my friend. That should be enough for you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And has he ever been more than that? -Lorenzo insisted, his gaze intense, locked on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked at him coldly, her words like a knife:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why do you care? You have no right to ask these questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo took a small step back, surprised by the sharpness of her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret stepped toward him, raising her voice just slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Don&#39;t try to understand. I don&#39;t need you to. And most of all, I don&#39;t need you digging into something that has nothing to do with you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to leave, but Lorenzo spoke again, this time with a vulnerability that stopped her in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Just tell me one thing, Margaret. Do you still love the man you left behind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned slowly, her expression briefly shifting before hardening again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes. But there&#39;s no point in talking about it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo nodded, as if her words confirmed something he had feared for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Then he was an idiot -he said, his tone full of regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret didn&#39;t respond. She simply turned and walked away toward her car, leaving Lorenzo standing in the middle of the parking lot, his thoughts and emotions swirling inside him like a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thing was clear to both of them: the past wasn&#39;t as buried as they wished it to be.</p>
