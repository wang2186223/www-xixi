                <p>That night, as Margaret put Mateo to bed after a day full of emotions, she felt exhausted, but not just physically. Her son&#39;s words and the way Lorenzo had taken them kept swirling in her mind. How could she continue keeping her secrets when Lorenzo was so close, not only to her but also to Mateo?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making sure Mateo was sound asleep, Margaret stepped out onto the balcony of her apartment. The city of Paris sparkled under the moonlight, but this time, the view offered no comfort. Her mind was tangled in a whirlwind of unanswered questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why does everything have to be so complicated? -she whispered, hugging herself as a cold breeze made her skin shiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few gentle knocks on the door pulled her from her thoughts. When she opened, she found Lorenzo holding a small bag in one hand and wearing a calm expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I didn&#39;t want to leave without talking to you -he said, entering the apartment after Margaret gestured for him to come in-. I thought we could share this. -He pulled out a bottle of wine and two glasses from the bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret sighed, though a part of her couldn&#39;t deny that she was glad to see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo, I don&#39;t know if this is a good idea</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why not? -he replied, placing the bottle on the table and looking at her intensely-. I&#39;m not going to pressure you to tell me anything, Margaret. I just want to be here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lip, unsure, but finally nodded and went to get a corkscrew. While she opened the bottle, Lorenzo watched her in silence. Margaret was a strong woman, he knew that, but he also saw the vulnerability she tried to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both sat on the sofa with their glasses. At first, the conversation was light: they talked about Mateo, the park, little anecdotes from the week. But Lorenzo knew there was something more, something Margaret needed to let out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret -he finally said, breaking the silence-, I&#39;m not going to deny that what Mateo said today made me think a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her gaze, toying with the glass in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-He&#39;s a child, Lorenzo. He doesn&#39;t understand the magnitude of what he&#39;s saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Maybe he doesn&#39;t fully understand, but that doesn&#39;t change what he feels -he replied, leaning a little toward her-. And I can&#39;t ignore it either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret placed the glass on the table and stood up, walking toward the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-This is complicated. Mateo is my priority, Lorenzo. And you you don&#39;t know everything about me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Then tell me. Let me understand you -Lorenzo insisted, standing up as well-. Margaret, you don&#39;t have to carry all this alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned toward him, her eyes shining with a mixture of determination and fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What if what I tell you changes everything? What if you decide you don&#39;t want to be close after knowing it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo took a step toward her, his gaze firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Nothing you say will change what I feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked at him, fighting against the wave of emotions that threatened to overwhelm her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo you can&#39;t promise that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised a hand, gently brushing her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-The only thing I can promise is that I&#39;m here, Margaret. For you and for Mateo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, time seemed to stop. Margaret felt the warmth of his hand, the weight of his words, and she knew she was closer than ever to crossing a line that could change everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours later, Lorenzo stood up from the sofa, leaving the empty glass on the table. The air in the room was charged with something undefined, a mix of uncertainty and hope. He glanced at Margaret one last time before heading toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m going back to the hotel. -He said with a light smile, but his eyes couldn&#39;t hide the sadness he felt at having to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret nodded silently, her gaze fixed on the floor, as if she couldn&#39;t find the right words. She didn&#39;t want Lorenzo to go, but she felt there were still many things between them that weren&#39;t ready to be resolved. And the fear of what might happen if she opened up to him still weighed heavily on her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo approached the door and paused for a moment, not turning toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, I know you&#39;re scared. And I understand that it&#39;s not easy. But I want you to know that when you&#39;re ready, I&#39;ll be here. No pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her gaze, searching for his eyes, but couldn&#39;t hold it for long. The desire to tell him everything, to open her heart, flooded her, but the words got stuck in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thank you -was all she could say, her voice broken, almost inaudible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo nodded, feeling the difficulty of the moment, but knowing he couldn&#39;t force anything. After a long sigh, he turned and opened the door. Before leaving, he paused for a moment, and with one last glance at Margaret, he said softly:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It doesn&#39;t matter what you decide, Margaret. I&#39;m not going anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with those words, he closed the door behind him, leaving her alone in the stillness of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret stayed there, still for a moment, processing Lorenzo&#39;s words. Each one of them cut through her like a cold current, but also warm, deep inside her. Would she ever be able to trust him completely? Let go of her fear and share everything she had guarded so closely?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Lorenzo walked down the street, the sound of his steps echoing in the stillness of the night. He knew he had to leave, but a part of him didn&#39;t want to let her go, didn&#39;t want to leave Paris without resolving everything he felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hotel was just a few blocks away, but his thoughts overflowed. The desire to get closer to Margaret, to show her he was willing to do whatever it took to gain her trust, was stronger than ever. But he also knew he couldn&#39;t rush it. He couldn&#39;t force her to open up if she wasn&#39;t ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he arrived at the hotel, he took the elevator up and entered his room without saying a word. The silence weighed on him, and as he collapsed onto the bed, he couldn&#39;t help but think about what would come next. Would he keep fighting for her? Could what he had to offer be enough?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, he could only wait, hoping that, at some point, Margaret would be ready to trust him with her story.</p>
