                <p>The wind blew softly as Mateo happily swung back and forth, his laughter echoing in the air. Margaret watched him from a distance, but her mind remained trapped in her son&#39;s words. Could it really be that simple? Could Lorenzo become what Mateo so desperately wanted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her internal struggle, Margaret knew she couldn&#39;t let her own fears ruin what Mateo felt. However, the question tormenting her wasn&#39;t just about Mateo. Deep down, there was the constant doubt about Lorenzo: was he truly willing to be a father figure to her son? And, most importantly, how did she fit into all of that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo had changed, yes. She knew it, she could feel it, but the past always seemed to come back, and Margaret couldn&#39;t forget the emotional storm caused by their separation. She didn&#39;t want to take that risk again. She couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She approached Mateo, who had already left the swing and was running toward a group of children. She smiled warmly as she watched him, but her smile quickly faded as a shadow of worry surrounded her. How was she going to handle all of this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, her phone vibrated in her purse. She took it out, hoping it would be something to distract her for a moment. But upon seeing the name on the screen, a mix of surprise and anxiety took over her. It was Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Hello, Lorenzo -Margaret said, her voice a bit shaky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-How&#39;s everything? -he replied, his tone warm and familiar, as if nothing had changed between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Good... everything&#39;s good. Mateo is enjoying the park -Margaret replied as she watched her son laugh and run with the other children. She couldn&#39;t help but feel a small lump in her throat. How had it come to this? How had she come to doubt her feelings for Lorenzo so much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m glad to hear that. -Lorenzo&#39;s voice softened. -Do you have some free time? I need to talk to you about something important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret frowned. What could it be about? Worry grew inside her, but she decided not to jump to conclusions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Sure, I can stop by your house in a little while -she replied without thinking too much. Something inside her told her she couldn&#39;t avoid this conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Perfect. I&#39;ll see you soon, then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended, and Margaret stood still for a few seconds, watching Mateo play. She knew she had to talk to Lorenzo, but she couldn&#39;t shake the uncertainty that engulfed her. What could he possibly want to tell her? Was he also starting to have doubts about what was happening between them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day passed quickly, and soon after, she found herself at the door of her apartment, a mix of emotions running through her. The sound of her phone vibrating again startled her. It was a message from Adrien.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien: Is everything okay?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret couldn&#39;t help but smile at her friend&#39;s message, although she knew it wasn&#39;t the right time to talk to him about what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret: I&#39;m fine. I just need to clear some things up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put her phone away and, taking a deep breath, rang the doorbell. When the door opened, Lorenzo greeted her with a look that reflected calm, but there was something else on his face that Margaret couldn&#39;t decipher right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Hello -she said, trying to sound natural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Hello, Margaret -Lorenzo replied, inviting her in. -Would you like something to drink?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-No, thank you. I just want to talk -Margaret responded as she sat down on the couch, searching for the right words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo sat across from her, watching her closely, as if waiting for her to start the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about all this -Margaret said, finally finding the courage to speak. -About what Mateo said this morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo frowned, concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I know. -His tone was soft, almost shy. -I know, Margaret. I know what Mateo wants, and I want to be honest with you. I never imagined this would be easy. But I want you to know that what Mateo feels isn&#39;t something to be taken lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked at him intently, seeing the sincerity in his eyes. But still, she couldn&#39;t help but feel afraid of what she was about to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t know if this can work, Lorenzo -Margaret said, her voice trembling. -I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready to let Mateo get more attached to you. I don&#39;t want him to go through that if, later on... if later there&#39;s no chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo leaned toward her, and with a softness that surprised her, took her hands in his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I understand, Margaret -he said, his voice calm and full of understanding. -What you&#39;re saying isn&#39;t easy, and I respect that. But I promise you I won&#39;t give up. Mateo is important to me, and what I want most is to see him happy. But I also know that the most important thing here is you. I want you to give me the chance to show you that what I want is what will be good for both you and Mateo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret fell silent, listening to his words, but her mind was still in chaos. She didn&#39;t know if she should take the risk of believing him, if she should trust that this time Lorenzo was being sincere, or if he was just looking for something that they could never have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing she knew for sure was that, at that moment, her heart was as divided as it had ever been.</p>
