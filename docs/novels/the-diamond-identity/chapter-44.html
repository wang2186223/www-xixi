                <p>The next afternoon, Mateo couldn&#39;t stop jumping excitedly around Margaret and Lorenzo. He had insisted all through breakfast on going to the amusement park, and his enthusiasm was so contagious that neither of them could say no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Come on, Mom! Come on, Lorenzo! I want to go on the Ferris wheel! -exclaimed Mateo while holding his little shoes, trying to put them on by himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret, watching the scene with a mix of tenderness and amusement, leaned down to help him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-First, let me make sure you have the right shoes on, champ.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo, leaning against the door, watched them with a calm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It looks like there&#39;s no negotiating. It&#39;s going to be an adventure day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It seems that way -replied Margaret, giving him a warning look-. But remember, you&#39;ll have to get on the rides too. It&#39;s not just about watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo raised an eyebrow, pretending to be concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Does it include things that spin too much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Definitely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo laughed, excited, and ran toward the door as soon as he was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go! I want to get there!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The amusement park was alive: children&#39;s laughter, carousel music, and the tempting smell of cotton candy and popcorn. Mateo didn&#39;t know where to start, pointing at each attraction with the excitement of someone seeing the world for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-First, the Ferris wheel! -he shouted, pulling on Lorenzo&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret, walking beside them, watched curiously how Lorenzo adapted easily to Mateo&#39;s excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Shouldn&#39;t we start with something less... high? -asked Lorenzo, looking at the giant wheel with a hint of nervousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Are you scared? -asked Mateo, amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Me? Not at all -replied Lorenzo, pretending to be confident-. Let&#39;s go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the top of the Ferris wheel, the view was breathtaking. Mateo was between them, pointing excitedly at the city that stretched beyond the park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Look, it seems like we can touch the sky! -he exclaimed, laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret leaned toward her son, stroking his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Do you like being here, champ?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo nodded, looking at Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I like it a lot. And I like being with you too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The statement was simple, but it had a profound impact on both adults. Lorenzo glanced at Margaret from the corner of his eye, with an expression that said more than he could put into words. She, for her part, looked away, fearful of what that connection was starting to mean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the Ferris wheel, they went on several rides: bumper cars, the kiddie train, and a roller coaster that clearly left Lorenzo dizzy, although he tried to hide it so as not to disappoint Mateo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I think bumper cars are more my style -said Lorenzo, leaning on a railing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Are you sure you don&#39;t want another ride on the roller coaster? -joked Margaret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Not in a million years -he replied, making both of them laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, they reached a cotton candy stand. Mateo, with a big piece in his hands, sat on a bench while Margaret and Lorenzo watched him closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thanks for this, Lorenzo -Margaret said quietly, without looking directly at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You don&#39;t have to thank me. If I&#39;m honest, I think I&#39;m enjoying this more than I expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked at him, noticing a sincerity in his words that disarmed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mateo really likes you. It&#39;s rare for him to connect like that with someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo smiled, watching the little one laugh as cotton candy stuck to his cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-He&#39;s special. I don&#39;t know how to explain it, but I feel like... I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve known him forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked away, fighting against the lump in her throat. She knew that connection wasn&#39;t a coincidence, but it still wasn&#39;t the time to reveal it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I just hope you don&#39;t disappoint him -she said quietly, more to herself than to Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her with a determination that made their eyes meet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I promise I won&#39;t. Not either of you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret wanted to respond, but Mateo interrupted, running toward them with sticky hands from the cotton candy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Let&#39;s go to the carousel! It&#39;s the last one, I promise!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both laughed, letting the child lead them back into the world of laughter and lights of the park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The afternoon at the park had been a total success. Mateo couldn&#39;t stop laughing and talking excitedly about all the attractions as they walked toward the exit. Lorenzo was holding the little one in his arms, since he had insisted he was too tired to walk. Margaret followed closely behind, enjoying the moment, although something inside her kept her on alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they reached a nearby bench to rest before heading back, Mateo leaned his head on Lorenzo&#39;s shoulder, looking at him with dreamy eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo -the child said, with that curious and direct tone that only children can have-. Do you want to be my dad?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed to stop. Margaret, who was sipping from a water bottle, nearly choked. She coughed lightly, dropping the bottle in the process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mateo... -Margaret tried to intervene, her cheeks turning red and clearly nervous-. Don&#39;t say things like that...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lorenzo stopped her with a gesture of his hand, keeping his gaze on the little one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why are you asking me that, champ?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo shrugged, playing with the buttons on Lorenzo&#39;s shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Because you&#39;re nice to me. You make me laugh and take me to fun places. And... I don&#39;t have a dad. But if you want, you could be one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret felt like the ground was crumbling beneath her feet. She looked at Lorenzo, trying to interpret his reaction, but his face was calm, though his eyes sparkled with a mix of surprise and tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-That&#39;s a very important question, Mateo -Lorenzo replied, hugging him tighter-. Being a dad isn&#39;t just taking you to the park or making you laugh. It&#39;s taking care of you, protecting you, and being there for you always, even when things aren&#39;t easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo lifted his head and looked at him seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Do you want to take care of me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Of course I do -Lorenzo said without hesitation. Then, he looked at Margaret, whose expression was a mix of nervousness and something that Lorenzo couldn&#39;t quite identify-. But I think that&#39;s something I should talk to your mom about too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret stood up abruptly, crossing her arms to hide her nervousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mateo, honey, Lorenzo is a friend. You shouldn&#39;t put him in that position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-But mom -the boy insisted with a pout-, he would be a good dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mateo, enough -Margaret responded gently but firmly. Then, she looked at Lorenzo-. I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know why he said that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo stood up, still holding Mateo, and smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Don&#39;t worry. Kids just say what they feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The response made Margaret tense up even more. She didn&#39;t know if Lorenzo was joking or if he had actually taken Mateo&#39;s question seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked toward the park exit, Margaret was silent, lost in her thoughts. Lorenzo, on the other hand, kept entertaining Mateo, as if the conversation from a few moments ago hadn&#39;t shaken him as much as it had her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, when they reached the car, Lorenzo took the opportunity to approach Margaret while Mateo got distracted by a nearby ice cream cart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You don&#39;t have to get nervous about what Mateo said -Lorenzo said quietly, with a calm smile-. But I want you to know something: what I feel for him is genuine. I&#39;m not playing, Margaret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him, feeling her heart race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo, you don&#39;t know everything about me. If you did you might not be so willing to say those things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo shook his head, moving a little closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What if I told you that nothing you say will change how I feel?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked away, not knowing how to respond. Lorenzo&#39;s words were both a comfort and a threat at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Mateo ran back toward them, interrupting the tense moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Look, mom! Lorenzo! I want an ice cream before we leave!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret took a deep breath, regaining her composure, and smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Let&#39;s go, champ. You and your cravings</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked toward the ice cream cart, Lorenzo didn&#39;t take his eyes off Margaret. He knew there was something more, something she was hiding, but he also knew he had to be patient. Mateo had already asked his question, and Lorenzo was more determined than ever to be a part of their lives, no matter how long it took.</p>
