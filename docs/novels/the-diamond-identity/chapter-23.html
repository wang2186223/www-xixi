                <p>The morning was calm, with a clear sky and a radiant sun that seemed to welcome a new day full of possibilities. Lorenzo arrived at Margaret&#39;s house, determined to say goodbye before his imminent return to Colombia. When he knocked on the door, a small boy with brown hair and lively eyes answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Hello! -Mateo greeted with a big smile, holding a toy in one hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo looked around, surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Hello, champ. Is your mom home?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-She went out with my dad Adrien. She said she wouldn&#39;t be long, but I stayed because I&#39;m playing. Do you want to come in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo hesitated for a moment, but the warmth of the child disarmed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Sure, if it&#39;s not a problem -he said as Mateo took his hand and led him inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was filled with small details that spoke of a peaceful life: toys scattered, children&#39;s books on a table, and drawings hanging on the wall. Mateo sat on the floor with his toys and looked at Lorenzo with bright eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Do you want to play with me? -he asked enthusiastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo smiled, unable to resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why not?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the next hour, Lorenzo focused on building blocks, racing toy cars, and listening to the stories Mateo made up with overflowing imagination. He felt strangely comfortable, as if this moment offered him a break from the chaos that had been his life lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they played, Lorenzo noticed something that froze him: a small mole on the palm of Mateo&#39;s right hand. His heart began to race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had the same mole, exactly in the same spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to remain calm, Lorenzo began asking casual questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mateo, do you like ice cream?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes! I really like chocolate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo nodded, mentally noting the coincidence: his own favorite flavor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What about sports? Do you like playing soccer?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo shook his head, frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Not much. I prefer to draw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo smiled. He hadn&#39;t been a big soccer fan as a child either, always preferring quieter activities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You&#39;re very creative. Do you like reading stories?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes. My mom reads to me every night. Sometimes my dad Adrien reads too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo felt a slight pinch in his chest when he heard Adrien mentioned. He decided to change the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And do you like to travel?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo nodded enthusiastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes, but we don&#39;t travel much. Mom says we&#39;ll soon go back home from Paris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo squinted his eyes, wondering if Margaret was talking about returning permanently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It must be fun to travel with your mom -he commented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo smiled widely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes, but when I grow up, I want to travel like superheroes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo laughed softly, charmed by the child&#39;s innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Mateo got up and ran to a shelf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Wait! I&#39;m going to show you something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo watched as he pulled out a photo album. The boy returned with the book in his hands and handed it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s our album. My mom says our memories are here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo opened the album, feeling a mix of curiosity and anticipation. The first photos showed a newborn baby wrapped in a blanket. There were images of a woman with her face partially covered by a wig and sunglasses, holding Mateo in her arms. Lorenzo continued flipping through the pages, looking for something that would confirm or disprove his suspicions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo pointed to a photo with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Look, here I am on my birthday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo studied the image. The child was blowing out candles while a feminine hand -clearly Margaret&#39;s- held the cake. There was something in the scene that felt familiar, but he couldn&#39;t pinpoint what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to ask more, the front door opened. Margaret entered, with Adrien behind her. Both froze when they saw Lorenzo sitting with Mateo and the album in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What are you doing? -Margaret asked, her tone tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo calmly closed the album and stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mateo wanted to show me his photos. I hope it wasn&#39;t a problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked at Mateo, who lowered his gaze, as if he knew he had done something wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s nap time for you -Margaret said, her tone softer but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mateo nodded and left the room without saying anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they were alone, Margaret crossed her arms and looked at Lorenzo coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What did you come for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo kept his composure, although his mind was filled with questions he knew he couldn&#39;t ask... yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I just came to say goodbye. I&#39;m leaving for Colombia tonight -he said with a slight smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret nodded, clearly uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Then, safe travels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo knew it wasn&#39;t the right time to press further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thanks. And... take care of yourselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left the house with a heavy heart and his mind filled with thoughts. As he walked toward his car, he couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the mole on Mateo&#39;s palm and the strange feeling that this child might actually be his son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret took the album with trembling hands, watching as Lorenzo walked out the door. Her breath was shallow, as if the mere fact of having seen him with Mateo had triggered a storm inside her. Adrien, who had been watching the scene from a corner, stepped forward and placed a hand on her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Are you okay? -he asked with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret nodded quickly, though it was clear she wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes, I&#39;m fine. I just need a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat on the couch and opened the album to where Mateo had left it. In silence, she turned the pages with nervous fingers, studying each image as if trying to make sure there were no traces Lorenzo could interpret. But as she turned one more page, her heart stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There it was, like a footprint from the past: a photo of her and Lorenzo when they were younger. The memory was clear. They were in a flower field in Colombia, she wore a simple white dress, and Lorenzo had his arm around her waist, smiling as if the whole world belonged to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret closed her eyes tightly, cursing herself for not having destroyed that image long ago. Adrien, who had sat beside her, leaned in to look at the page and frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why do you still keep this? -he asked, his voice more serious than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret left the album on the table, as if the simple touch of it burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t know. Maybe because it was a memory of something I thought I&#39;d never lose...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien took the album and studied the photo for a few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time to tell him the truth?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked at him with narrowed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What truth? That I&#39;m Amelia? That Mateo is his son? Adrien, I can&#39;t do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why not? -he insisted, slamming the album back on the table-. Lorenzo already suspects something, I can see it in his eyes. And now that he spent time with Mateo, I don&#39;t think it will take him long to connect the pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret jumped to her feet, stepping away from Adrien as if she needed distance between them and the topic he had brought to light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s not that simple, Adrien. If Lorenzo finds out the truth, everything will change. And I&#39;m not sure it will be for the better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien stood up, crossing his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What are you really afraid of? That he won&#39;t forgive you? Or that he&#39;ll try to take back what he lost?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret glared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m afraid for Mateo. I&#39;m afraid Lorenzo will try to take him from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien shook his head, his expression softening slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo isn&#39;t like that. I know him, Margaret. Maybe he makes a lot of mistakes, but he&#39;s not cruel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret let out a trembling sigh, her gaze lost in the photo of the album.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-That&#39;s what you think, but you don&#39;t know everything that happened. He left me alone, Adrien. When I needed him the most, he left. And now I can&#39;t risk him coming back and trying to make decisions about Mateo like nothing ever happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien looked at her with a mix of frustration and compassion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, you&#39;ve been carrying this secret for years. Lorenzo has the right to know the truth, and Mateo deserves to know his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him, her eyes filled with repressed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Adrien, don&#39;t ask me to do this. You&#39;ve always been on my side, you&#39;ve always supported me. Please, don&#39;t pressure me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien took a step toward her and put his hands on her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;ll always be on your side, Margaret, but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t tell you when I think you&#39;re making a mistake. Because, believe me, if Lorenzo finds out the truth on his own, it will be much worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked away, unable to respond. Adrien&#39;s words echoed in her head like a bell she couldn&#39;t ignore, but her fear was stronger than any logic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Adrien sighed and let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Do what you want, Margaret. But don&#39;t forget that every day you keep this secret, you&#39;re getting closer to losing everything you&#39;re trying to protect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying anything else, he left the room, leaving her alone with her thoughts and the album open on that image that meant so much. Margaret sank onto the couch, a tear rolling down her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was there, waiting to be revealed, but she wasn&#39;t ready to face the consequences. Not yet.</p>
