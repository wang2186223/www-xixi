                <p>Leaving the hospital was imminent. Adrien walked slowly, leaning on Ana&#39;s arm, who guided him with gentle yet firm support. Luca was beside them in a wheelchair, his eyes gleaming with a hope he hadn&#39;t shown in a long time. The idea of returning home, though filled with uncertainty, offered a sense of relief. Adrien knew he still had a long way to go to regain his strength, but at least he wasn&#39;t doing it alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the sound of hurried heels echoed in the hallway. Ana had no time to react when she saw a tall, dark-haired, and elegant woman approaching quickly. The woman&#39;s gaze was firm, almost imposing, carrying an aura of authority that couldn&#39;t be ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Adrien&#39;s mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What&#39;s going on here? - The woman&#39;s voice was authoritative, with a tone that left no room for doubt or contradiction. It wasn&#39;t a question but a statement of her dominating presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien, upon seeing his mother, stopped. His face, though tired, filled with an uncomfortable expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mom - he said, with a resigned look. He knew his mother wouldn&#39;t accept him staying at Ana&#39;s house, and this was just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien&#39;s mother, flashing a cold smile, approached him, casting a dismissive glance at Ana and Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What are you doing here? - she said, not bothering to be polite. -You&#39;re coming with me, Adrien. You&#39;re weak and need my help. And your son - she turned to Luca with an air of superiority - he&#39;ll come with me too. I&#39;ll handle everything. The best thing is for both of you to come with me. So, Ana, please don&#39;t get in the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana, completely taken aback by Adrien&#39;s mother&#39;s sudden appearance, couldn&#39;t help but tense up. She hadn&#39;t expected anyone else to have control over the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What are you saying? - Ana asked, holding Adrien&#39;s hand more firmly. -I&#39;m not letting you take my son just like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien&#39;s mother looked at her with disdain, as if Ana were nothing more than a nuisance in her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Your son - Adrien&#39;s mother emphasized the words with a tone of contempt - would be much better off with me. You don&#39;t know how to handle this situation. I&#39;ll take them to my house, where I can care for them properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana frowned, feeling a wave of anger starting to build inside her. She wasn&#39;t going to let Luca go without a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I won&#39;t let you do that - Ana said, her voice tense and determined. -Adrien and Luca are staying with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien&#39;s mother glared at her, her eyes full of disdain. She didn&#39;t like being challenged, especially not by a woman who had no idea what it meant to be a mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I told you not to get in the way, dear - she replied, with a smile that wasn&#39;t kind but rather mocking. In one swift motion, she extended her hand and shoved Ana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana, surprised by the aggression, took a few steps back, stumbling before falling into a nearby chair. The push wasn&#39;t strong, but it was enough to leave her stunned. For a moment, she stared at Adrien&#39;s mother, who watched her coldly, as if what she had just done was the most normal thing in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien, seeing what had happened, felt his breath catch. He couldn&#39;t stand his mother acting like this, but he also couldn&#39;t bear to see Ana hurting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mom! - Adrien exclaimed, grabbing his mother by the arms and pulling her away from Ana. -What the hell are you doing?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien&#39;s mother, now shocked by her son&#39;s reaction, looked at him with a mixture of anger and surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m just trying to take care of you, Adrien. - Her voice, however, didn&#39;t sound empathetic but as if she believed she was absolutely right. -Has this woman influenced you so much that you&#39;d rather stay with her? I&#39;ll take you to my house, where you can recover properly!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana, still stunned by the push, slowly stood up. She placed her hand on the arm that had absorbed the impact, but she wasn&#39;t going to back down. No matter what Adrien&#39;s mother did, she was going to fight for what she believed was best for Luca and Adrien.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You have no right to do this, ma&#39;am - Ana said, her voice renewed with determination. -They&#39;re staying with me. You&#39;re not going to tear us apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien&#39;s mother, seeing Ana&#39;s resistance, paused for a moment, as if considering her next move. The tension in the air grew thicker, and Adrien felt a weight in his chest. His mother&#39;s words and Ana&#39;s attitude only made an already difficult situation more complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I told you, Adrien. She doesn&#39;t know what it means to care for a child - his mother said, not taking her eyes off Ana. -The best thing is for Luca and you to come with me. So please stop making excuses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could say anything else, Adrien, with labored breaths, stepped between his mother and Ana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Enough! - Adrien shouted, looking at his mother with a mixture of frustration and exhaustion. -I&#39;m staying with Ana, with Luca. I&#39;m not going to your house. I won&#39;t let you keep controlling my life like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien&#39;s mother, hearing this, took a step back, looking at her son with a mix of disbelief and disdain. She couldn&#39;t understand why Adrien, after everything, would choose to stay with Ana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conflict between them, between what Adrien wanted and what his mother desired, had just erupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You need to be responsible, Adrien - she said, turning away with a gesture full of disapproval. -You&#39;ll regret this, mark my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one last cold glance, Adrien&#39;s mother walked away, leaving them behind in an atmosphere heavy with unresolved tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien looked at Ana, who now watched him with a mix of concern and something deeper, something he couldn&#39;t yet identify. But he was sure of one thing: the fight wasn&#39;t over, and he would face it alongside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, all that mattered was that Adrien and Luca were safe, and their small home awaited them.</p>
