                <p>The soft morning sunlight filtered through the curtains of Adrien&#39;s apartment, but his mind was trapped in a whirlwind of thoughts that suffocated him. He couldn&#39;t stop thinking about Ana&#39;s words, about the child he didn&#39;t know he had, and the anguish of their situation. Everything had changed in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door burst open, and Adrien looked up, startled. Ana entered, her eyes red and swollen as if she had been crying for hours. Her face was a mix of worry and fear. She didn&#39;t have to say anything for Adrien to know something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Ana... what&#39;s going on? -Adrien asked, his voice rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s... it&#39;s about the boy, Adrien -Ana said, her voice trembling as she clutched her phone with shaking hands. -He&#39;s in the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien felt the air leave his lungs as his heart sank. Every part of him went on high alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What&#39;s wrong with him? Is he... is he okay? -he asked, dread tightening in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana sank into a nearby chair, her face pale as if the news had drained all her strength. Her eyes filled with tears again, this time of despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-He needs a bone marrow transplant -she said, barely able to steady her voice. -The doctors say there&#39;s a chance to save him, but... only you can help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien stared at her, uncomprehending. Confusion gripped him, and his stomach churned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-How? Why me? -he demanded, searching for answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Because... -Ana swallowed hard before continuing, -I&#39;m not a match for him. There&#39;s no one else who can be a donor. And the doctors... they said that as his father, you&#39;re his only hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien froze, as if time itself had stopped. Her words echoed in his mind, over and over, and his heart, though already broken by her revelation, began to beat with a new urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why didn&#39;t you tell me this before, Ana? -he asked, his voice laced with frustration and pain. -Why didn&#39;t you tell me my son could be in danger?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana looked at him, knowing there weren&#39;t enough words to justify her past decisions. But now, none of that mattered. All that mattered was saving the boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I told you when it was too late -she admitted, her voice breaking. -I didn&#39;t want you involved, Adrien. I didn&#39;t want you to suffer for something you never chose. But he&#39;s here now, and he needs you. He needs his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien closed his eyes, taking a deep breath to steady himself. The emotions threatened to overwhelm him, but beneath the fear of the unknown, a sense of responsibility took root.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Where is he? -he asked, standing abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-He&#39;s at a clinic downtown -Ana said, relief and desperation in her voice. -The doctors said we have to act fast, Adrien. If we don&#39;t...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Take me there -Adrien interrupted. The decision was already made. He couldn&#39;t stand by while his son fought for his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana nodded quickly, rising to her feet. Together, they left the apartment, their steps hurried as they headed toward an uncertain future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air felt heavier as they approached the clinic. Adrien walked beside Ana, the weight of responsibility pressing down on him. He had spent so long unaware of his son&#39;s existence, but now, none of that mattered. The boy, hidden in the shadows of his life, needed help, and Adrien wouldn&#39;t turn away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A doctor greeted them at the clinic and guided them to the emergency ward. There, in a hospital bed, lay a small, fragile child. His face, eerily similar to Adrien&#39;s, was a mix of innocence and vulnerability. His eyes were closed, and his breathing uneven, making Adrien&#39;s fear swell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Is that him? -Adrien murmured, staring at the boy with emotions he couldn&#39;t name. -What&#39;s his name?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Luca -Ana replied, her voice trembling. -His name is Luca. He&#39;s... he&#39;s our son, Adrien.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien took slow, hesitant steps toward the bed. His shoulders shook slightly as he stood over the child, fear and awe mixing in his expression. Luca was connected to several machines, each beep a painful reminder of his fragile state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien reached out with a trembling hand, then hesitated. How could he touch someone he hadn&#39;t even known existed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-He&#39;s so small... -Adrien whispered, his voice barely audible as tears welled up in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana watched him, her chest tightening with guilt. She wanted to comfort him, to explain again why she had kept the truth hidden, but she knew this wasn&#39;t the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m so sorry... -Adrien murmured, leaning over Luca&#39;s bed. -I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t here. I didn&#39;t know you existed, but that doesn&#39;t matter now. I&#39;m here, son. I&#39;m here, and I won&#39;t let anything happen to you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana choked back a sob. Seeing Adrien like this, vulnerable and speaking to a child who couldn&#39;t respond, was heartbreaking. She had stolen years of fatherhood from him, moments they could never get back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien turned to her suddenly, tears streaming down his face, anger and pain mingling in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-How could you, Ana? -he said, his voice broken but intense. -How could you keep him from me? How could you carry this alone, knowing I was out there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana&#39;s legs felt weak, but she forced herself to stand firm. This was the moment she had dreaded for years, but she couldn&#39;t avoid it any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I had no choice, Adrien -she said, her voice stronger than she expected, though her heart broke with every word. -Your mother threatened me. She said if I didn&#39;t leave and get rid of the baby, she would ruin both our lives. I couldn&#39;t hurt Luca. I couldn&#39;t give him up, so I left. It wasn&#39;t easy, Adrien. It was never easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien clenched his fists, trying to contain the anger boiling inside him. He wanted to yell, to blame her, himself, the world for what they had lost. But when he looked at Luca again, all that anger melted away, replaced by an overwhelming fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-This isn&#39;t about you or me now -he said finally, his voice firmer but still shaky. -This is about him. Saving him. And if that means leaving the past behind, so be it. But I need to know something, Ana. -He looked her directly in the eyes, his intensity making her want to look away. -Did you really think I wouldn&#39;t love him? That I wouldn&#39;t want to be part of his life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana swallowed hard, tears streaming freely down her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It wasn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t believe in you, Adrien. I didn&#39;t believe in myself. I didn&#39;t know how to face everything that was happening, and I was scared. But now I know I was wrong. I was wrong to keep you away, and I&#39;ll never be able to make it right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell between them, heavy with unspoken emotions. Adrien finally turned back to Luca, his expression softening as he took his son&#39;s tiny hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-The first thing I&#39;ll do when we leave here is make up for all the time we lost -he said, his voice steady with resolve. -This boy is my son, and I won&#39;t fail him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana watched him, her heart filled with remorse but also a glimmer of hope. Maybe this was the beginning of something new, something they couldn&#39;t have had otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then an alarm on one of the machines blared, and a nurse rushed into the room. Adrien and Ana exchanged panicked looks as doctors hurried in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What&#39;s happening? -Adrien asked, his voice trembling as he stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-His condition is fluctuating -the nurse said calmly, though her tone didn&#39;t hide the urgency. -We need to stabilize him immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien froze, watching helplessly as the medical team surrounded Luca. Ana gripped his arm, seeking solace in his presence, though both knew this was beyond their control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Adrien made a decision. No matter how scared he was or how many questions remained unanswered, he would do whatever it took to save Luca -even if it meant facing his own demons and a past he thought he had buried long ago.</p>
