                <p>In her room, standing in front of the mirror, she wondered if she should reveal her true identity as a famous designer. Maybe if she showed who she really was, her family would accept her and see that she wasn&#39;t simply &#34;the CEO&#39;s wife,&#34; but a woman with talent and accomplishments of her own. However, the fear of rejection kept her captive. What if her success only intensified the contempt she already felt? With a sigh, she decided that for now, she would continue keeping her secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning, as Amelia reflected, Lorenzo entered the room with a worried look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Love, I need to talk to you -he said, his tone serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What&#39;s wrong? -Amelia asked, her heart racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s my mother. She&#39;s been insisting that she&#39;s feeling unwell again. I think she really needs care -Lorenzo explained -I&#39;m leaving for a business trip tomorrow, and I need you to stay here and take care of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia felt a pang in her heart. Although she wanted to help Lorenzo, she knew that taking care of his mother meant facing the cruelty of the Montalbán family again. But she couldn&#39;t refuse to support him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Alright, I&#39;ll do whatever is necessary -she replied, trying to remain calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning of the trip came quickly, and Amelia felt trapped in the house. Lorenzo hugged her tenderly before leaving, promising that everything would return to normal soon. However, as he left, Amelia felt darkness envelop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days without Lorenzo turned into a series of constant trials. Lorenzo&#39;s mother, always with an air of superiority, watched her with critical eyes. However, Amelia&#39;s biggest torment became her sister-in-law, Valeria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment Lorenzo left, Valeria wasted no time humiliating her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Are you sure you can handle this? -Valeria asked, watching Amelia struggle with household tasks. Her tone was scornful, as if she took pleasure in her discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m fine, thank you -Amelia responded, trying to keep her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Valeria didn&#39;t stop there. One day, as Amelia struggled to cook a proper dinner for her mother-in-law, Valeria entered the kitchen and began criticizing every move she made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Is that how you make a stew? No wonder Lorenzo always looks for food outside the house -Valeria said with a mocking laugh -If you were a good wife, you&#39;d know how to do this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia felt the heat of humiliation rise to her face, but she forced herself to ignore the comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m learning -she responded with a trembling voice. Valeria smiled, enjoying her sister-in-law&#39;s suffering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Maybe you should stay in the kitchen. After all, that&#39;s what&#39;s expected from a woman like you -she said before leaving, leaving Amelia feeling helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation worsened when Valeria began inviting her friends over, using Amelia as a subject of mockery. One day, while a group of high-society women gathered in the garden, Valeria called out to her from the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Amelia! Come here, we have a question for you -she shouted, with a smile that didn&#39;t reach her eyes. As Amelia approached, the air seemed to grow heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-We wanted to know what it&#39;s like being a famous designer in a house like this -one of Valeria&#39;s friends said, her lips curling in disdain -Isn&#39;t it a bit... ridiculous?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter echoed in the air, and Amelia felt the sharp sting of humiliation. Despite everything, she forced herself to smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-My designs are important to me -she replied, trying to maintain her dignity -You might not understand, but there&#39;s more to me than what you see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valeria burst into a mocking laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Really? It doesn&#39;t show at all. Maybe you should stop dreaming and start accepting your place -she said, as the other women laughed even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia felt the tears beginning to well up in her eyes, but she fought to keep them from falling. Every word from them was like a blow, and the idea of revealing her true identity haunted her, but fear and shame kept her silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One afternoon, while in her room, Amelia overheard conversations coming from the hallway. She discreetly peeked out and realized that Valeria and her mother-in-law were talking. Her heart skipped a beat as she heard her sister-in-law&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You&#39;re not really sick, are you, mother? -Valeria said, her voice full of laughter -You&#39;re just pretending so Lorenzo won&#39;t leave you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-That&#39;s right -Lorenzo&#39;s mother responded -And in the meantime, Amelia becomes our servant. I won&#39;t give her any rest until she can&#39;t take it anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia felt the world fade around her. The truth was even crueler than she had imagined. Her mother-in-law and sister-in-law were manipulating the situation to make her life miserable, while she remained trapped in their game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days passed in a silent nightmare, and the pressure of living in that house became unbearable. Lorenzo&#39;s mother continued to make disparaging comments, and Amelia began to wonder if she would ever be seen with respect. In those moments of solitude, the idea of escaping became a tempting whisper in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, one particularly difficult afternoon, Amelia locked herself in her room, feeling the pressure building in her chest. Through the window, she looked at the outside world, a world that seemed more distant every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why do I feel this way? -she asked herself, looking at her reflection-. I&#39;m a designer. I shouldn&#39;t have to endure this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With determination, she decided it was time to act. The next time she faced Valeria and her mother-in-law, she wouldn&#39;t remain silent. She had to find a way to make herself heard. But fear still lurked, reminding her that at any moment, her secret could become her greatest enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the day faded and loneliness engulfed her, Amelia promised herself that she wouldn&#39;t be defeated. But the shadow of uncertainty continued to haunt her, and she knew that revealing her identity could be both her salvation and her downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days turned into an endless nightmare for Amelia. Valeria&#39;s humiliation and her mother-in-law&#39;s constant manipulation had become unbearable. However, one day, she finally heard the familiar sound of Lorenzo&#39;s car pulling into the mansion. Immediate relief washed over her, but so did an unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lorenzo entered the house, he looked tired, as if the weight of his work was on his shoulders. Amelia rushed to meet him at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo! -she exclaimed, trying to hide her anxiety -I&#39;m so glad to see you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled weakly, but his eyes reflected concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-How have you been? -he asked, watching her closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia hesitated. There was so much she wanted to tell him, but the words seemed stuck in her throat. Finally, she took a deep breath and decided it was time to reveal the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo, I need to talk to you about your mother -she said, feeling the tension rising in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What about her? -he asked, his worried expression intensifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-She&#39;s not sick. She&#39;s been pretending all this time to keep you close -Amelia explained, feeling her heart race as the words poured out -I&#39;ve overheard conversations between her and Valeria. They&#39;re manipulating the situation to make my life miserable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo&#39;s gaze turned cold, and Amelia could see the anger beginning to form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What are you talking about? -he asked, his voice tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo, you can&#39;t keep ignoring what&#39;s happening here. Your mother doesn&#39;t need care; she just wants to keep you by her side and make me suffer -she said, her voice trembling with anguish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo stared at her, processing the information. Shadows of disbelief and anger crossed his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Amelia, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re saying this. My mother has always been a strong woman, and I don&#39;t think she&#39;s capable of something like that -he responded, though his words sounded hollow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia felt the disappointment cut through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-But she is, Lorenzo. I&#39;ve lived through this. She&#39;s manipulated you, and you haven&#39;t seen it -she said, her voice rising -The humiliation I&#39;ve endured from Valeria and your mother is unbearable. I can&#39;t go on like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo took a step back, as if Amelia&#39;s words were a physical blow. Confusion and anger began to mix on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re telling me this. My mother has been sick and has needed care. How can you be so cruel? -he responded, his voice breaking with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia felt the rage growing inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Cruel! -she shouted -Am I the cruel one for wanting you to see the truth? I&#39;ve been fighting for our marriage while you were away, and she&#39;s been using that situation to tear us apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence that followed was heavy. Lorenzo ran a hand through his hair, frustrated, as emotions swirled inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t know what to think -he responded, his voice shaky-. Please, don&#39;t speak ill of my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia felt a stab of desperation. Would she ever be able to make Lorenzo see the truth?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo, please -she implored -I just want you to understand what&#39;s really happening. I need your support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he seemed lost in his own thoughts, still processing the revelation Amelia had shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m going to talk to her -he said finally, his tone determined -I need to hear the truth from her.</p>
