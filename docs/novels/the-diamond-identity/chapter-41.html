                <p>Margaret woke up the next day with a strange mix of emotions. The memory of Lorenzo&#39;s kiss lingered, but it brought a wave of doubt and guilt. As she looked in the mirror, she tried to convince herself it was a mistake, a fleeting weakness she had to overcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doorbell interrupted her thoughts. Adjusting her silk robe, she walked to the door. When she opened it, she found Adrien holding a small box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I hope I&#39;m not disturbing you, Margaret. I brought this for Mateo. -Adrien&#39;s warm smile was tinged with concern, which Margaret immediately noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You&#39;re never a disturbance, Adrien. Come in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Adrien stepped inside, Margaret felt grateful for his presence. He always knew how to calm her storms, even without saying much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Is everything okay? -Adrien asked, sitting on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret crossed her arms, biting her lip as she debated whether to share what had happened the night before. Finally, she decided to open up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Adrien, as you know, Lorenzo is here in Paris. We attended a business dinner together... and things got complicated. -Her voice trailed off, as if saying it aloud made it more real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien raised an eyebrow but stayed silent, waiting for her to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-He kissed me. -The words burst out, and she looked at Adrien, bracing for his reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien&#39;s face remained neutral for a moment before he sighed deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-How do you feel about it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret sank onto the couch beside him, covering her face with her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Confused. Angry. Maybe... something else. -Her voice quivered slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien studied her silently before speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, this is hard, I know. But you need to ask yourself something important: Did that kiss mean anything to you, or is it just tying you to a past you&#39;re trying to leave behind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him, her eyes brimming with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t know, Adrien. Every time I think I&#39;m ready to move on, he shows up and messes everything up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien leaned forward, resting his hands on his knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, whatever happens, I want you to know I&#39;ll always be here for you. No matter what you decide or who you choose. My priority will always be you and Mateo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret felt a lump in her throat. Adrien had always been her rock, the one constant in her life when everything else fell apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thank you, Adrien. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Adrien left, Margaret felt even more torn. Lorenzo and Adrien represented two completely different parts of her life: the past filled with love and betrayal and the present full of stability and support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere in Paris, Lorenzo sat on his hotel terrace, a glass of wine in hand. He gazed at the city, reflecting on the kiss from the night before. It had been impulsive, but he didn&#39;t regret it. He had felt something in Margaret that he hadn&#39;t in years-a spark of connection, a trace of what they once shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he also knew Margaret was battling her own demons. If he wanted to win her over, he would need to prove he wasn&#39;t the man who had hurt her. That meant time, patience, and most of all, action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up his phone and sent a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I hope I&#39;m not disturbing you, Margaret. I&#39;d like to see you tomorrow. There&#39;s something I need to tell you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set the phone down, feeling a weight in his chest as he waited for her response. He didn&#39;t know exactly what he would say, but he knew he had to try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret read the message hours later, while Mateo played in the living room. Her hands trembled as she held the phone, but she knew she couldn&#39;t avoid Lorenzo forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right. Tomorrow at five.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sending the reply, Margaret felt a mix of anticipation and fear. Lorenzo was willing to fight, but was she ready to let him back into her life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret left her house, leaving Mateo with Adrien. She felt nervous, her heart heavy. After a while, she arrived at the café where Lorenzo was waiting. He was already seated by a window, his expression calm, but his eyes carried something she couldn&#39;t decipher. When he saw her, Lorenzo stood up and smiled-that smile that always managed to unsettle her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thank you for coming -he said, pulling out the chair for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I hope this is worth it -Margaret replied, keeping her tone distant as she sat down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo didn&#39;t respond immediately. He took a sip of his coffee, studying her, as if trying to memorize every detail of her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s always worth it when it&#39;s about you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret frowned, but her heart skipped a beat. She knew Lorenzo had a way with words, and she promised herself not to be swayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What do you want, Lorenzo? -she asked bluntly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rested his elbows on the table, intertwining his fingers as he leaned forward slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I want to know you, Margaret. I want to know what makes you laugh, what inspires you, what keeps you up at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sincerity caught her off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-That sounds like something a man says when he&#39;s trying to woo someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And what if I am? -Lorenzo replied, his gaze fixed on hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret felt her defenses begin to crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You have a wife, Lorenzo. Have you forgotten about her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question surprised him, but Lorenzo remained composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-No, I haven&#39;t forgotten her. But sometimes, life takes us down unexpected paths. And right now, mine leads to you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret tensed, struggling to maintain her mask of indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m not a consolation for your mistakes, Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t see you as a consolation. I see you as a second chance for something real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo&#39;s words struck directly at emotions Margaret had tried to bury. Before she could respond, he continued:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I know it&#39;s hard for you to trust me, and I don&#39;t blame you. But I&#39;m not here to force you into anything. I just want to show you that I can be someone you trust, someone who values you for who you are.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked at him, trying to read his true intentions. There was something different about him, something she couldn&#39;t ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I can&#39;t promise you anything, Lorenzo -she whispered, her voice breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo nodded, accepting her words without pressuring her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m not asking for promises, Margaret. Just a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence between them was broken only by the murmur of other customers in the café. Margaret knew Lorenzo was playing with fire, but what terrified her was the possibility that she wanted to get burned too.</p>
