                <p>Margaret woke up with a heavy heart. Lorenzo&#39;s words still echoed in her mind, but she wasn&#39;t ready to face them alone. She decided she needed someone to talk to, someone who had always been her unwavering support: Adrien.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They met at noon in a small café near the Eiffel Tower, a place where they used to gather before life became so complicated. Adrien arrived with a warm smile and a wool scarf that seemed to wrap him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, is everything okay? -he asked as he sat across from her, noticing the tension in her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed, staring at her coffee cup before responding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t know, Adrien. Lorenzo is here, in Paris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien raised an eyebrow, setting his coffee down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What is he doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-He says he&#39;s here for business, but... his actions are confusing me. Yesterday, he confessed he still has feelings for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien remained silent for a moment, processing the information. Finally, he leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And what do you feel?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question struck her like lightning. She had spent so long trying to bury her feelings for Lorenzo that she wasn&#39;t sure how to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t know -she admitted at last-. Part of me wants to believe him, but the other... I can&#39;t forget everything that happened. I can&#39;t trust him so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien nodded, his gaze soft but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And you shouldn&#39;t. But you also need to ask yourself something important, Margaret: is this about you or Mateo?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her gaze, gripping her cup tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s about both of us. I don&#39;t want Mateo to grow up feeling like something is missing in his life. But I also can&#39;t risk Lorenzo breaking us again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien leaned back, crossing his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, you&#39;re one of the strongest women I know. You&#39;ve built an incredible life for yourself and for your son. But if Lorenzo wants to be part of that, he has to prove he deserves it. And you, my dear friend, don&#39;t have to decide anything now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret looked at him with a small smile, grateful for his support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You always know what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien shrugged with a mischievous smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s my job, isn&#39;t it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they left the café, Adrien insisted they take a walk by the Seine. Margaret, still burdened, agreed. They strolled slowly, talking about everything and nothing, when Adrien broke the silence with an unexpected question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What if Lorenzo tries to get close to Mateo?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret stopped in her tracks, her gaze fixed on the river.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I won&#39;t allow it, not until I&#39;m sure of his intentions. Mateo doesn&#39;t deserve to be part of something uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien nodded, placing a hand on her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Then make sure you hold your ground. If Lorenzo wants a place in your life, he&#39;ll have to earn it. And if he tries to take advantage of you or Mateo... well, you know I&#39;ll always be here to defend you both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret let out a small laugh, relieved by his unwavering support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I know, Adrien. I know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the sun began to set behind the buildings of Paris, Margaret felt a little calm return to her heart. Lorenzo could try whatever he wanted, but she was clear this time she wouldn&#39;t face it alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their walk along the Seine, Adrien insisted on taking Margaret to a small hidden park, a place only true Parisians knew. There, under a sky painted with warm colors by the sunset, they sat on a worn wooden bench surrounded by trees whose leaves gently fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien watched Margaret as she absentmindedly played with a leaf that had landed on her lap. There was something in her eyes, a mix of strength and vulnerability that had always fascinated him. Finally, he broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, there&#39;s something I&#39;ve been wanting to tell you for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up at him, curious but slightly uneasy. Adrien had always been honest, but this time his tone was different, more solemn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What is it? -she asked softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deep breath, resting his elbows on his knees as he looked ahead, avoiding her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I know I&#39;ve always been by your side, as a friend, as support... and I want you to know that will never change. But I think you need to know something, something I&#39;ve perhaps hidden too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret watched him silently, her heart beating faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Adrien...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised a hand to stop her before she could say more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Let me finish. I don&#39;t expect anything from you, nor do I want to pressure you. But the truth is... I&#39;m in love with you, Margaret. I have been for years, and you already know that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The confession left her speechless. Adrien continued, his voice calm but full of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I know you don&#39;t feel the same way about me, and that&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not saying this to change anything between us. I just needed you to know that hasn&#39;t changed. Because even if my heart belongs to you, my priority will always be to protect you. You and Mateo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret felt a lump in her throat. Adrien had been her rock during the darkest moments, and now she understood the sacrifice that had meant for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Adrien... I don&#39;t know what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled, with the warmth that had always comforted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You don&#39;t have to say anything. I just want you to know that no matter what happens, I&#39;ll always be here for you. Even if Lorenzo comes back into your life, even if you decide to give him a chance, I&#39;ll be by your side-as a friend, as family... as whatever you need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears filled Margaret&#39;s eyes. She leaned toward him and took his hands in hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You&#39;re the best man I&#39;ve ever known, Adrien. I don&#39;t deserve this much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien shook his head, looking at her tenderly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Don&#39;t say that. You and Mateo are my family. And though it hurts to know I&#39;ll never be more than your friend, that&#39;s enough for me. Because all I want is to see you happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret hugged him tightly, letting her emotions flow. Adrien wrapped his arms around her, offering the comfort and safety he had always provided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thank you, Adrien. For everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they finally pulled apart, both had tears in their eyes but also a deeper understanding of their connection. As they walked back under the starlit sky, Margaret felt that no matter what happened with Lorenzo or her past, she would always have Adrien as her refuge. And that was a relief amid the storm ahead.</p>
