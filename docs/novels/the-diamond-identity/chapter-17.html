                <p>Lorenzo held the ring in his hands, inspecting it carefully. It was, without a doubt, the same ring he had exchanged with Amelia at their wedding, the engravings still intact: Lorenzo &amp; Amelia. His mind kept questioning how it had ended up there. The event coordinator had no clear answers, merely mentioning that it was found at one of the main tables, where the most important guests, including Margaret, had been seated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in his office, Lorenzo shut the door and dropped into his chair. The weight of uncertainty was overwhelming. He pulled out his phone and scrolled through the event photos that had been posted on social media. As he browsed, one picture caught his attention: Margaret smiling beside Adrien. Something about the way she looked at the camera made him pause. Her gaze, the curve of her lips... it all felt familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Clara knocked softly before entering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mr. Lorenzo, Miss Margaret is on the line. She wants to speak with you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo straightened his posture and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Put her through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret&#39;s voice on the other end sounded calm, but Lorenzo detected a slight tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Good morning, Mr. Lorenzo. I wanted to discuss some details about the design we&#39;re working on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo took a deep breath, trying to keep his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Of course, Margaret. But first, I have a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Go ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Were you at the event until the very end?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief but noticeable pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes, though I left shortly after the speech concluded. Why do you ask?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Something was found at the venue -Lorenzo said, glancing at the ring on his desk-. A ring with very specific engravings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-A ring? -Margaret&#39;s voice sounded puzzled, but Lorenzo sensed something else, as if she were carefully measuring her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes. A wedding ring. It has my name... and my wife&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Margaret fell silent for a few seconds longer than usual. Finally, she replied in a neutral tone:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-That&#39;s... quite curious. Do you think it has anything to do with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo closed his eyes, trying to decipher the truth in her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m not sure. But I feel like everything is connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Well, if there&#39;s anything I can do to help, please let me know -Margaret said before quickly ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call ended, Lorenzo was left with even more questions. Margaret had sounded calm, but her reaction had been too calculated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to uncover the truth, Lorenzo asked Clara to investigate Margaret and Adrien&#39;s backgrounds, something he hadn&#39;t considered doing before out of respect. Meanwhile, he immersed himself in Margaret&#39;s designs. Every stroke, every detail seemed to tell a story he couldn&#39;t quite decipher. But something caught his eye: in one of her latest sketches, Margaret had drawn a pair of wedding rings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He examined them closely. The design was unique, but what unsettled him were the engravings. Although they weren&#39;t identical to the ones on the found ring, the style of the letters and their arrangement were suspiciously similar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Clara returned with an envelope in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mr. Lorenzo, I found something you should see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo took the envelope and quickly opened it. Inside was information about Margaret and Adrien, but what caught his attention the most was an old photograph of Margaret with shorter hair and a much younger appearance. His heart stopped as he recognized her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Amelia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The similarities were undeniable. Lorenzo felt his world collapsing. Why had Amelia assumed another identity? And why had she stayed so close to him without revealing the truth?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could process what he had just discovered, his phone buzzed. It was a message from Adrien, who had tried to reach him during the event but hadn&#39;t succeeded. The message was short, but enough to stir Lorenzo&#39;s emotions further:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to talk. It&#39;s about Margaret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo clenched his fists, his mind spinning in a thousand directions. The truth seemed on the verge of being revealed, but the cost of facing it would be higher than he had ever imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo met Adrien in his office, ready to confront him with all the questions tormenting him. However, Adrien entered with a calm demeanor, as if he had rehearsed every word he was about to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thank you for seeing me, Lorenzo -Adrien began, taking a seat across from him-. I know this is complicated, but I need you to listen carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo crossed his arms, clearly impatient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Don&#39;t waste my time. What do you have to say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien held his gaze, his voice firm but carrying a certain solemnity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret is not who you think she is. She&#39;s Amelia, your wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The impact of those words was so strong that Lorenzo was left speechless for a few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-How can you be so sure? -he finally asked, his voice tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien took a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I know because I&#39;ve always known. Since she decided to hide behind that name, I&#39;ve been by her side. We&#39;ve always been good friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo leaned forward, his eyes blazing with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And you never thought to tell me before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien raised a hand, asking for calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Don&#39;t make this easy for yourself, Lorenzo. I respect that you&#39;re married, and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve kept this secret for three years. But things can&#39;t go on like this anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo looked at him distrustfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why now? Why tell me this at this moment?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien shrugged, his tone somewhat provocative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Because I want to play fair. Amelia is an incredible woman, and yes, I love her too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo felt the anger rise in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What are you saying?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien remained composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Relax, Lorenzo. I&#39;m not here to steal your wife. She&#39;s yours, and I respect that. But if I want to stay in her life, I need everything to be out in the open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo gritted his teeth, struggling to control his temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And what do you expect from me? To just accept this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien smiled faintly, almost coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I expect you to fully trust her. After all, she&#39;s been hiding this from you for years because of you. My advice? Win her over again, little by little. Find out what she truly feels for you now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo stared at him, trying to decipher his intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why are you helping me, Adrien?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien stood, smoothing out his jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Because I want this to end once and for all. But make no mistake, Lorenzo: this isn&#39;t a favor. It&#39;s my way of ensuring Amelia finds what she truly needs, whether it&#39;s with you... or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Lorenzo could respond, Adrien headed for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Oh, and one last thing. Keep this between us. Don&#39;t tell Amelia you know. Give her the chance to trust you first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, Adrien left the office, leaving Lorenzo alone with his thoughts, a heavier burden now weighing on his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo sat alone, staring at Margaret&#39;s sketches on the table. Now he knew the truth, but the question remained the same: what would he do with it?</p>
