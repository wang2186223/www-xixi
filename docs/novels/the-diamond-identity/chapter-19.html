                <p>The restaurant was packed, but to Lorenzo, the noise around him felt like a distant echo. Seated across from Adrien, he studied every one of his gestures, searching for signs, hidden answers. Adrien, for his part, remained unbothered, sipping his glass of wine with apparent nonchalance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Adrien -Lorenzo finally broke the silence, leaning forward-. I need you to be honest with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien lifted his gaze, calm but with a glimmer of caution in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I always am, Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mateo is three years old -Lorenzo said bluntly-. Amelia disappeared three years ago. Now I know that Margaret is Amelia. Is Mateo my son?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien&#39;s face showed no surprise; he had been expecting this question. He lowered the glass carefully, taking a moment before answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-That&#39;s not something I can answer for you -he said, his tone controlled-.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo slammed his hand on the table, drawing the attention of some nearby diners. Adrien didn&#39;t flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why can&#39;t you tell me? If you know the truth, say it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien stared back at him, with a seriousness Lorenzo hadn&#39;t seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Because that truth isn&#39;t mine to share, Lorenzo -he said, his voice low but firm-. It&#39;s up to Amelia to decide if she wants to tell you or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo let out a frustrated sigh, running his hands through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-This makes no sense. If you knew she was Margaret, if you knew everything she did, why didn&#39;t you tell me before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien leaned his elbows on the table, leaning in slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I already told you: I also love her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though it was the second time Lorenzo had heard that confession from Adrien&#39;s lips, it hit like a bombshell, and he felt his chest tighten. He looked at Adrien in disbelief, trying to process what he had just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You love her? -he asked, his voice barely a whisper-. Since when?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien held his gaze, not breaking eye contact for an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Since before you met her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo leaned back in his chair, as if Adrien&#39;s words had struck him physically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And you did nothing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-No, because she chose you. And I respected that. But now things are different, Lorenzo. Amelia&#39;s life has changed. You have to decide if you&#39;re willing to do what it takes to win her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo closed his eyes for a moment, trying to calm the storm of emotions swirling inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And if Mateo isn&#39;t mine? -he asked finally, in a softer, almost fearful tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien tilted his head, choosing his words carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Then you&#39;ll have to decide if that changes how you feel about her. But I warn you, Lorenzo: don&#39;t pressure her, don&#39;t try to force anything. Amelia deserves to be won over, not demanded answers from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo remained silent, his mind trapped in a whirlwind of doubts and possibilities. Adrien watched as his rival and friend battled with his own thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Lorenzo stood up from the table, leaving a bill to cover the check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thanks for your honesty -he said before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien followed him with his eyes, his own emotions mixed between respect and longing. He knew he had just set in motion a series of events that would change everything, but he also knew he had done the right thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the main hall of the mansion, Lorenzo sat on the leather armchair facing his mother, who watched his every move with a blend of calculated tenderness and inherent coldness. She held a cup of tea, feigning serenity, though her eyes missed nothing of her son&#39;s restlessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo, dear, you&#39;ve been here for hours and barely said a word. What troubles you so much? -she asked, placing the cup on the saucer with a delicate clink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo ran a hand over his face, his thoughts tangled in Adrien&#39;s words and memories of Amelia. Finally, he exhaled in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mother did you know that Margaret is Amelia? -he asked directly, without preamble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo&#39;s mother raised an eyebrow, her face barely revealing surprise, though her mind began to work rapidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why do you ask? -she responded softly, leaning toward him as if she didn&#39;t understand where he was going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Don&#39;t pretend, Mother! -Lorenzo exclaimed, standing up abruptly-. Adrien confirmed it yesterday. All this time, Amelia has been close, and I I was a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained silent, her fingers tracing the edge of her cup as she calculated her response. Finally, she let out a theatrical sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo, dear, if Amelia returned under the name Margaret, she must have had her reasons. Perhaps she didn&#39;t want you to recognize her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And Mateo? -Lorenzo interrupted, his voice filled with emotion-. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s strange? The boy is three years old, Mother! And if Amelia disappeared three years ago</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her gaze, studying her son carefully before replying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mateo -she repeated, letting the word hang in the air. Then she smiled with a sweetness Lorenzo recognized as dangerous-. Now that you mention it, there is something familiar about him. When I saw him for the first time, I couldn&#39;t help but notice how much he looks like you did as a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo&#39;s heart skipped a beat, but before he could respond, Eugenia continued:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-However, we can&#39;t jump to conclusions. What proof do you have? Has Amelia said anything to you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo shook his head, frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-No. Adrien refused to tell me anything about Mateo. But I can&#39;t ignore the obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo&#39;s mother tilted her head slightly, her gaze fixed on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Then you have two choices, my son. You can confront Amelia directly and demand answers or you can play smart. If it&#39;s true that Margaret is Amelia, and if that boy is your son, you&#39;ll need to approach her carefully. You don&#39;t want to scare her away before getting what you need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-&#34;What I need&#34;? -Lorenzo repeated, frowning-. Mother, I&#39;m not talking about business. I&#39;m talking about my family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled softly, but Lorenzo could see the hint of manipulation in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Family is the most important business, Lorenzo. And you should always think strategically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo looked away, feeling trapped between Adrien&#39;s words and his mother&#39;s. He knew she was partly right, but he couldn&#39;t help feeling like a pawn in his own game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m not sure I want to play this &#34;game,&#34; Mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mother of Lorenzo stood gracefully, placing a hand on his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Whether you want to or not, my son, you&#39;re already in it. Now go and do what you must. But remember, you must always stay in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo nodded slowly, though deep inside, control was the last thing he felt. As he walked away from the hall, his mother&#39;s words echoed in his mind, blending with Adrien&#39;s confession and memories of Amelia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of the truth was closer, but Lorenzo didn&#39;t know if he was ready to face it.</p>
