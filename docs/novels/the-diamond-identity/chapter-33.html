                <p>That same night, Clarisse reviewed the files her investigator had sent her. It wasn&#39;t much; Margaret was reserved and kept her personal life away from the public eye. But one thing stood out: there were no records of the child&#39;s father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Interesting -she murmured, a calculated smile on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reclined on the sofa, holding a glass of wine, her thoughts revolving around Margaret and the boy. If Lorenzo found out about this, it could become a problem-or an opportunity to regain control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret or whatever your name is, I&#39;ll uncover your secret. And I promise, you won&#39;t walk away unscathed -she said, raising her glass as if toasting her impending victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the world, in Colombia, Lorenzo was in his office, reviewing the latest financial reports of the company. He had been working tirelessly since his return, trying to save what was left of his business. Yet, he couldn&#39;t fully concentrate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret lingered in his thoughts. Not just because of her talent, but because he knew she was Amelia. And now, more than ever, he wanted to get closer to her, to find a way to win her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ringing of his phone broke his train of thought. Seeing it was Clarisse, he sighed in annoyance before answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What do you want, Clarisse? I&#39;m busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I just wanted to tell you something curious, Lorenzo. Today, I ran into Margaret and her son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo felt his heart skip a beat, but he tried to remain calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And what&#39;s so interesting about that? -he asked in a neutral tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Oh, nothing, it&#39;s just that -she paused, savoring the moment-. That boy has eyes that look very familiar. I don&#39;t know why, but he reminded me a lot of someone I know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Stop with your nonsense, Clarisse. I don&#39;t have time for this -Lorenzo replied, hanging up before she could continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at the phone, his jaw tightening. Clarisse was playing with fire, and although he didn&#39;t know how much she had discovered, it was clear she wasn&#39;t going to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo stood up and looked out the office window, his mind torn between protecting Amelia, Mateo, and dealing with the fallout of everything that was coming to light. If Clarisse kept meddling, he&#39;d have no choice but to act before the past consumed everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret was in her workshop, organizing some of her latest designs to send to production. It was her refuge, the place where she always found peace amidst chaos. But that day, her tranquility was shattered by a notification on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a message from Adrien:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Margaret, we need to talk. I&#39;ve received some concerning information. Clarisse is investigating you, specifically about Mateo. Be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret&#39;s heart raced. Clarisse was crossing a dangerous line, one she wouldn&#39;t allow anyone to cross.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for Margaret to decide to take matters into her own hands. She wouldn&#39;t wait for Clarisse to get closer to her life or her son. She knew the woman frequented an exclusive tea lounge in the heart of Paris, so she went straight there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she arrived, she found Clarisse sitting at a table by the window, a champagne glass in her hand and her usual arrogant, confident expression. Margaret didn&#39;t ask for permission; she simply stood in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Well, Margaret, what a surprise to see you here -Clarisse said, raising an eyebrow and setting her glass down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Don&#39;t make this harder than it already is, Clarisse. You know exactly why I&#39;m here -Margaret replied coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clarisse smiled, but there was a hint of defiance in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Whatever do you mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret leaned closer to her, her words low but filled with intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Stop investigating me. And most importantly, stop investigating my son. Mateo has nothing to do with your schemes or your games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clarisse feigned surprise, but Margaret noticed how her fingers tensed around the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Oh, dear, I didn&#39;t know a little curiosity about your life would cause such an uproar. It&#39;s just professional interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret let out a cold laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Make no mistake, Clarisse. I&#39;m not someone you want to play games with. I won&#39;t let you touch Mateo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clarisse maintained her smile, but her gaze now held a trace of nervousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Don&#39;t you dare keep pretending. If you take one more step toward my son, you&#39;ll find out I&#39;m much more than I seem. And believe me, you don&#39;t want to meet that side of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere in the tea lounge grew tense. Several people turned to look at them, but Margaret didn&#39;t move. She held Clarisse&#39;s gaze until the woman looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, Margaret straightened and turned to leave. Clarisse sat still for a few seconds, processing what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Margaret stepped out onto the streets of Paris, she felt a mix of anger and relief. She had confronted Clarisse, but she knew that woman wasn&#39;t one to back down easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-No matter what she does -she told herself as she walked-. Mateo is my priority, and I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to protect him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, as she tucked her son into bed, Margaret couldn&#39;t help but notice every little detail about Mateo: the way his hair fell across his forehead, his steady, calm breathing, and how his small body curled up against the pillow. He was a happy, innocent child, and that was all that mattered to her. Yet her mind was far from the peace her son exuded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting on the edge of the bed, her fingers gently brushed the blanket as her thoughts turned dark. She knew Clarisse wasn&#39;t an easy woman to confront. She had played with others&#39; fates before, manipulating and destroying without remorse. Margaret had learned to live with the weight of her own decisions, but this time, it wasn&#39;t just her at stake-it was Mateo, her little Mateo, at the center of this storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I won&#39;t let anyone hurt you, my love -she whispered softly, even though Mateo was already fast asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose slowly and walked to the window. Outside, the lights of Paris sparkled like tiny stars, a stark contrast to the darkness she felt inside. Placing a hand on the cold glass, she let her mind work on what lay ahead. If Clarisse decided to make another move, Margaret would be ready. She was no longer the same woman who had fled years ago, wounded and broken. Now, she was a mother, a renowned designer, and above all, someone who had learned to fight for what she loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every beat of her heart, she felt her resolve strengthen. No matter what she had to do or the risks she had to take, Clarisse had underestimated the Margaret she faced now-and that would be her greatest mistake. The battle was just beginning, and Margaret didn&#39;t intend to lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, she left Mateo&#39;s room, carefully closing the door behind her. Her son was safe for now, but Margaret knew she had to prepare for what was coming. She sat at her desk, pulled out a sheet of paper, and began drafting a plan, mapping out every possible move Clarisse might make and strategizing how to protect her son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in years, Margaret felt like she wasn&#39;t just surviving but fighting back. And that filled her with a strength she hadn&#39;t realized she possessed.</p>
