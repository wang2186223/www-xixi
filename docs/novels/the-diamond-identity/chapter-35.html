                <p>Margaret was in her studio, focused on a new design she had started that morning. The delicate lines of the sketch spread across the paper, and for the first time in days, she felt an unusual calm. Mateo was playing quietly in the next room, his occasional laughter filling the space with a warmth that reminded her why she fought so hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden ringing of her phone broke the moment. She glanced at the screen. Clarisse. She frowned, hesitating to answer, but something told her she had to face whatever was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Clarisse? -she answered in a neutral tone, though she knew the call wouldn&#39;t be pleasant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, congratulations! -Clarisse exclaimed, her voice dripping with sarcasm-. It seems you finally got what you wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret sighed, feeling her patience slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, Clarisse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Oh, don&#39;t you? -Clarisse laughed bitterly-. Lorenzo just removed me from the project and ordered me back to Colombia. All thanks to you!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-If Lorenzo made that decision, it was because of something you did, not me -Margaret replied calmly-. I have nothing to do with what happens in your professional life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Of course, you do! -Clarisse snapped, losing her composure-. Since you showed up, everything has been a disaster. You show up with your fatherless son, playing the pity card, and now you&#39;re manipulating Lorenzo to fill that void, aren&#39;t you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment hit like a slap. Margaret closed her eyes for a moment, trying to stay calm, but anger began to rise in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Be careful with your words, Clarisse -she said, her voice low but firm-. You have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Oh, please! -Clarisse continued, her tone full of venom-. It&#39;s obvious what you&#39;re doing. Lorenzo has a soft heart, and you&#39;re taking advantage of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret felt the air around her tense. She couldn&#39;t allow Clarisse to keep talking about Mateo that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-My son is none of your business, Clarisse -she said sharply-. Neither you nor anyone else has the right to mention him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why? -Clarisse mocked-. Are you afraid Lorenzo will find out something? Is that why you&#39;re playing the perfect mother while scheming to manipulate him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret clenched her teeth, gripping the phone tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Listen to me, Clarisse. You have no idea what you&#39;re saying. I warn you, don&#39;t mess with my son. If you ever insinuate something about him or try to harm me, you&#39;ll see a side of me you won&#39;t like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence on the other end was brief but enough for Margaret to know her warning had struck a nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-This isn&#39;t over, Margaret -Clarisse finally said in a colder tone-. Lorenzo might be on your side now, but I won&#39;t let you ruin everything I&#39;ve built.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What you&#39;ve built is based on lies and manipulations, Clarisse. Sooner or later, it all falls apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, Margaret hung up. She took a deep breath, feeling the anger still coursing through her veins but also a renewed determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clarisse had proven to be a real threat, but Margaret wasn&#39;t about to back down. For Mateo, for her peace of mind, and for everything she had achieved, she would fight to the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret set the phone down on the table with a sharp thud. Her breathing was rapid, and Clarisse&#39;s words kept echoing in her mind. How dare she? With what right did she talk about Mateo and her life as if she knew anything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the living room, she heard her son&#39;s cheerful voice, oblivious to the storm brewing around them. She took a moment to calm herself before walking in to hug him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Are you okay, Mom? -Mateo asked, looking at her with those eyes that reminded her so much of Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes, sweetheart, I&#39;m fine -she replied, stroking his hair lovingly-. Want to go for a walk?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes! -the boy exclaimed excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in Colombia</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo sat in his office, reviewing some documents, but his mind was far from the numbers in front of him. The earlier call with Clarisse had been tense, and though he didn&#39;t regret removing her from the project, he knew she wasn&#39;t someone to take defeat quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone vibrated on the desk, and seeing Clarisse&#39;s name on the screen, he let out a heavy sigh. He hesitated for a few seconds before answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What do you want, Clarisse? -he asked impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I just wanted to inform you that Margaret is craftier than you think -she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm-. Do you really trust her? Because I wouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo clenched his teeth, trying to remain calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Clarisse, I don&#39;t have time for your manipulations. I already told you to go back to Colombia and stay out of the project. Don&#39;t insist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Manipulations? -she laughed-. I&#39;m surprised you&#39;re talking about manipulations when you have a woman who&#39;s been hiding things from you all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What are you talking about? -he asked, though his tone made it clear he didn&#39;t want to play games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Her son, Lorenzo. Doesn&#39;t it strike you as odd that Margaret is so secretive about him? Have you ever wondered who the father is?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo&#39;s heart skipped a beat. He didn&#39;t respond immediately, but his silence was enough for Clarisse to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;ll just say this: be careful. Margaret isn&#39;t as transparent as you think. Maybe you should do some digging yourself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo ended the call without another word. His mind was in turmoil. He didn&#39;t know if there was any truth to what Clarisse was saying, but part of him was beginning to wonder if he should confront Margaret directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in Paris</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret and Mateo strolled through a nearby park. The fresh breeze and her son&#39;s laughter gave her some peace after the confrontation with Clarisse. However, she couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something else was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone vibrated again in her pocket. She pulled it out, fearing it was Clarisse again, but Lorenzo&#39;s name lit up the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated for a few seconds before answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, I need to talk to you -he said, his voice more serious than usual-. It&#39;s important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone put her on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Sure, tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-In person. I&#39;ll be in Paris in a few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret felt the ground shift beneath her feet. She hadn&#39;t expected Lorenzo to make such a sudden decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Alright. Call me when you arrive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hung up, feeling as though time had stopped. Lorenzo was coming to Paris, and though she didn&#39;t know exactly what he wanted to talk about, she was sure it would change everything.</p>
