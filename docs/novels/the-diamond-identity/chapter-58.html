                <p>The car moved along a tree-lined road, leaving the hospital behind. Ana drove with determination, while Adrien and Luca sat silently together in the back seat. The air inside the vehicle was heavy with unspoken emotions. Adrien, though recovering, was still weak, and Luca, still frail, kept his small hands over his father&#39;s, seeking comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they reached the modest neighborhood where Ana lived, Adrien saw the house for the first time. It was small, with white walls slightly worn by time, but the flower-filled planters gave it a welcoming feel. It was simple, far from the luxury he had known, yet something about the way Ana looked at him made it feel like home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-This is it, -Ana said, turning off the engine. Her words were simple, but her voice carried a mix of pride and nervousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien nodded, glancing at Luca. -Ready to see your house, champ?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca nodded, clinging tighter to him. Adrien carefully got out of the car, making sure not to strain his body. Ana led them to the door, opened it, and invited them inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The interior of the house was warm, with simple furniture and a cozy decor. There were photographs on the walls, many of them of Luca at different stages of his life. Adrien looked at them closely, his heart sinking as he realized how much he had missed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s a modest place, but it has everything we need, -Ana said nervously, watching Adrien.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s perfect, -he replied sincerely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana gave a slight smile and then turned to Luca. -Come, I&#39;ll show you your room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien followed them, admiring how Ana had decorated the small room with care. There were toys, drawings, and a little desk with crayons and notebooks. Luca ran to his bed, excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-This is my favorite spot, -Luca said, pointing to a shelf filled with books and animal figurines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien approached, running his fingers over the spines of the books. -It&#39;s amazing, Luca. Your mom has done a great job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana, standing by the door, looked at him with a mix of pride and sadness. -I did what I could with what I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien turned to her. -You did more than I could have ever imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they could continue talking, a loud knock echoed from the door. Ana frowned, puzzled, and went to answer it. On the other side stood Mr. Fernández, the landlord, with his usual stern expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Ana, can we talk? -he said, glancing at Adrien inside the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Of course, Mr. Fernández. Is something wrong? -Ana tried to remain calm, though the man&#39;s presence always made her uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;ve been patient with you, but I can&#39;t wait any longer. I need you to pay the two months&#39; overdue rent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana felt the blood drain from her face. She had been so focused on Luca&#39;s illness and everything it entailed that she had neglected that debt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I understand, Mr. Fernández, but... I need a little more time. My son just got out of the hospital, and...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Ana, you gave me that excuse last month, -the man interrupted brusquely. Then he gestured toward Adrien-. If you have visitors, maybe they can help you cover it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien, who had been listening to the conversation from the couch, stood up with difficulty and approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-How much is owed? -he asked firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Two months. That&#39;s eight hundred dollars total, -replied Mr. Fernández, evaluating him with a critical look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien pulled out his wallet and began searching for his card. -I want to settle this right now. Do you accept transfers?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana stopped him, standing in front of him. -No, Adrien. You don&#39;t have to do this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes, I do, Ana. We&#39;re in this together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Adrien, it&#39;s not your responsibility, -she insisted, her eyes shining with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes, it is, -he responded softly but firmly. -Let me help you, Ana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Fernández, impatient, interrupted their discussion. -Are you going to pay or not?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes, it will be paid, -Adrien said, ignoring Ana&#39;s look of protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After completing the transfer in front of the landlord, the man checked his phone and nodded in satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Very well. But I don&#39;t want to hear excuses again. If there&#39;s another delay, I&#39;ll be forced to evict you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It won&#39;t happen again, -Adrien replied coldly, shutting the door as soon as the man left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana, furious but also touched, turned to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Adrien, you didn&#39;t have to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Of course I did, Ana. I can&#39;t just stand here and watch you carry all this alone. This is the least I can do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana looked at him, her eyes filling with tears. -I don&#39;t know how to thank you...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien gently took her hand. -You don&#39;t have to. I&#39;m here because I want to be, for you and for Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Luca appeared in the hallway, rubbing his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What&#39;s going on? -he asked sleepily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana approached him and picked him up, carrying him back to bed. -Nothing, sweetheart. Everything&#39;s fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she returned to the living room, she found Adrien looking out the window with a serious expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Are you okay? -she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes, but I realize how much you&#39;ve had to fight alone. I want to change that, Ana. I want to be here for you, for Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana didn&#39;t respond, but her heart filled with a mix of gratitude and fear. Things were changing, and although she didn&#39;t know how it would all end, for the first time in a long time, she didn&#39;t feel alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Ana tucked Luca into bed again, Adrien let his gaze wander across the small living room. On a corner shelf, a worn leather album caught his attention. Without thinking much, he picked it up and began flipping through the pages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, it was photos of Luca: his first birthday, his drawings, his laughter captured in everyday moments. But as he continued, his heart sank. There they were. He and Ana, younger, smiling as if nothing could tear them apart. There were photos of trips they had taken together, afternoons in parks, and even one he had taken himself, of Ana asleep in the car seat, a smile on her lips. Adrien felt a pang of nostalgia and pain. That life they had shared seemed so distant, so irretrievable, but at the same time, those images reminded him of what he had lost and what he might still try to reclaim.</p>
