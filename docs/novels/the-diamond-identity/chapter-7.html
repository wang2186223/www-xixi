                <p>In Paris, as Adrien stayed by her side, she couldn&#39;t help but think about what she would do. Could she continue to hide the truth? Or would she have to face the past that had caused her so much pain? A new life was growing inside her, but her heart remained divided between love, guilt, and fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia rose from the hospital bed with more effort than she had expected. Although the doctors recommended she stay for a few more days for observation, she couldn&#39;t afford to stay. She had to return to her life as Margaret before everything began to unravel. With Adrien by her side, she walked down the hallway toward the exit, her trembling hand still resting on her abdomen, constantly aware of the life growing inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Are you sure you don&#39;t want to rest more? -Adrien asked in a soft, but concerned voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia nodded, trying to seem stronger than she felt. The uncertainty had worn her down, but the fear of Lorenzo discovering the truth consumed her faster than any physical exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I can&#39;t stay here, Adrien -she said, her voice cracking slightly-. If I stay, everything will get even more complicated. I need time to think, to decide what to do about all of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien watched her carefully as they left the hospital into the cold Parisian air. The wind hit her face, and a shiver ran through her body, but it wasn&#39;t just the weather that made her tremble. She knew that with each step, she was moving farther away from Lorenzo, but at the same time, closer to a decision she could no longer postpone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got into the car in silence, while the city passed quickly in front of them. Amelia stared at the lights of Paris, which shone with a serenity that contrasted with the storm inside her. Thoughts about the baby, Lorenzo, and their future suffocated her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Amelia... -Adrien broke the silence as he drove-. Have you thought about what you&#39;re going to do with the baby? You know you can count on me, no matter what you decide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien&#39;s words were kind, but they weighed on her like a sentence. She knew he would support her no matter what, but that didn&#39;t make the decision any easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t know, Adrien -she whispered, looking at her clasped hands-. I don&#39;t know what to do. This changes everything. I can&#39;t keep pretending I can walk away from my past as if it never existed. But I also don&#39;t know if I can face Lorenzo or if he deserves to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien gripped the steering wheel, trying to contain his own feelings. Though he had promised to support her, the thought that Lorenzo would always have a part of Amelia, a part of her life that he could never reach, was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, they arrived at the apartment they shared. Adrien hurried to open the door for her, but Amelia remained at the entrance, her gaze lost on the horizon of the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Amelia -Adrien said softly, approaching her-. You don&#39;t have to make any decisions now. What matters is that you&#39;re okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia nodded, grateful for Adrien&#39;s patience, but inside, she knew that time was running out. Soon, she would have to face the truth: Lorenzo, her pregnancy, and the life she could never forget. She walked into the apartment with a lump in her throat, knowing that although she had left the hospital, her real struggle was only beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years had passed. Since Amelia&#39;s departure, Lorenzo&#39;s life had taken a turn for the worse. Rumors about his company, once an empire, circulated around Madrid. No one knew exactly what had happened, but those close to Lorenzo noticed his distraction and the constant melancholy in his eyes. Now, he was on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His company, which had once dominated the fashion and luxury design market, had lost its shine, and Lorenzo&#39;s erratic decisions had only accelerated its downfall. Poor investments, the loss of key clients, and Lorenzo&#39;s inability to focus after Amelia&#39;s departure had brought him to this point. There was only one chance left: a new project with one of the most prestigious jewelry designers of the moment, Margaret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting in his office, Lorenzo stared at the financial documents on the table. He knew he was losing control of everything he had once built. Failure surrounded him, but there was one opportunity, a small glimmer of hope that had presented itself: a new collaboration with Margaret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-This designer has revolutionized the market in recent years -his assistant said, handing him a folder with Margaret&#39;s designs-. If we manage to work with her, it could be the boost we need to get out of this crisis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo flipped through the designs. Something about them felt eerily familiar. The elegant lines, the combination of modern and classic styles. He lingered on one piece in particular: a delicate necklace that reminded him of something Amelia had sketched once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret -he whispered thoughtfully-. Who exactly is she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-She&#39;s a mystery -replied the assistant-. No one knows much about her, only that she&#39;s very private and never appears in public. But her designs have been an overwhelming success. If we manage to work with her, we could recover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo nodded, determined. This was his last chance. He couldn&#39;t afford to fail. He had to contact Margaret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Paris, Amelia -now known only as Margaret- had reached the pinnacle of success. Her jewelry was sold worldwide, and her name was synonymous with elegance and sophistication. She had built her life far from Lorenzo and Madrid, but she had never completely forgotten her past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One morning, while reviewing new contracts and proposals, her personal assistant placed a letter on her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-This one&#39;s from a company in Madrid. They&#39;re interested in a collaboration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia picked up the letter absentmindedly, but as she read the sender&#39;s name, her heart skipped a beat: &#34;the letter was from Lorenzo&#39;s company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands trembled slightly as her eyes scanned the proposal. Lorenzo was desperate, seeking a collaboration with her to save his company. However, there was no mention of Amelia. He had no idea that Margaret and his wife were the same person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Is everything okay? -her assistant asked, noticing the sudden silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes -Amelia responded, regaining her composure-. It&#39;s just an interesting proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided she would respond. Perhaps this was the opportunity she needed to confront her past, but without revealing her true identity yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in Madrid, Lorenzo was nervous. Margaret&#39;s response had arrived, and she was willing to hear his proposal. They had arranged a virtual meeting to discuss the details. Lorenzo anxiously adjusted his suit, knowing this was a unique opportunity to save everything he had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen lit up, showing Margaret&#39;s silhouette. Though she didn&#39;t reveal her face completely, the elegance in her posture and the firmness of her voice impressed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mr. Lorenzo -Margaret said in a cold and professional tone-. I&#39;ve reviewed your proposal. There may be a possibility for collaboration, but I need more details about your vision for this project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo tried to maintain his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mrs. Margaret, your work is admirable. I believe that together we could create something that could save my company. Your style would fit perfectly with what I need. It&#39;s a unique opportunity for both of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia listened carefully, feeling a mix of emotions. Three years had passed, but hearing Lorenzo&#39;s voice transported her back to a life she had tried to forget. She knew he wouldn&#39;t recognize her, but that didn&#39;t make the confrontation any easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I need time to think about it -Margaret finally said-. This is a big commitment, and I want to make sure it benefits both of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo nodded, grateful he hadn&#39;t been rejected outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meeting, Amelia stared at her reflection in the mirror. &#34;Could I really help Lorenzo, after everything that had happened?&#34; She knew his company was on the verge of collapse, and her designs could save it, but the pain from her past held her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Lorenzo felt uneasy. Something about Margaret&#39;s voice reminded him of Amelia. There was something in the way she spoke, in the confidence with which she handled business, that seemed strangely familiar. But he quickly dismissed the thought. &#34;Amelia was no longer part of his life.&#34; Or so he believed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After much thought, Amelia decided to accept Lorenzo&#39;s proposal, but under strict conditions: there would be no face-to-face meetings, only virtual contact. She knew that the closer she got to Lorenzo, the harder it would be to keep her identity hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, Lorenzo accepted without hesitation. He didn&#39;t know he was about to step into a dangerous game, one in which the truth would eventually come to light.</p>
