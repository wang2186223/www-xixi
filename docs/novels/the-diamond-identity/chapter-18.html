                <p>Lorenzo walked through the hallways of the mansion, trying to untangle the chaos in his mind. Adrien&#39;s words kept echoing: he loved Margaret but respected Lorenzo&#39;s marriage. Why say it now? Adrien didn&#39;t seem like an impulsive man, but that confession seemed to have a purpose beyond the obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without realizing it, his steps led him to his mother&#39;s greenhouse. There, among the perfectly tended orchids, he always found a mix of calm and confrontation. His mother was standing with her back to him, carefully trimming a wilted leaf. Although Lorenzo knew how harsh she could be with the outside world, in private, she always adopted a sweet and protective demeanor with him-a calculated sweetness to keep him under her control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo, dear, I wasn&#39;t expecting you so early -she said without even turning, as if she already knew he was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mother -he sighed-. I needed to talk to you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed the scissors on the table, turning with a gentle smile that never quite reached her eyes but always managed to disarm him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What&#39;s troubling you, my son? -she asked, gesturing for him to sit on a bench beside her. Her voice was so warm it almost made one forget how sharp she could be when she wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo hesitated for a few seconds. Talking to his mother was always a delicate game: she offered comfort, but always managed to gain something in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s Margaret -he finally admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mother&#39;s face lit up with subtle interest, though she kept her tone serene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Ah, Margaret. The woman who&#39;s saving your company. What about her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo averted his gaze, feeling a weight on his chest he couldn&#39;t quite identify.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I don&#39;t know... there&#39;s something about her that doesn&#39;t add up. Her closeness to Adrien, her evasiveness... And her son, Mateo...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy&#39;s name seemed to capture all his mother&#39;s attention. She tilted her head slightly, as if evaluating an important piece of a puzzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Mateo -she repeated softly, as if savoring the name-. He&#39;s an adorable boy. Although I can&#39;t help but notice something curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo looked up, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Curious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gently stroked his face, a gesture that always made him feel like a child under her protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-His eyes, Lorenzo. They&#39;re like yours when you were little. That intense look, almost identical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned, surprised by the comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What are you implying, Mother?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a light laugh, as if minimizing the importance of her words, though her gaze said otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Oh, nothing, dear. Just an observation. Sometimes coincidences lead us to interesting places, don&#39;t you think?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo stayed silent, trying to process what he&#39;d just heard. But his mother, as always, took the moment to guide him where she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Listen to me, son -she said, taking his hands delicately-. I know this situation with Margaret and Adrien can be confusing, but you must remember who you are. You&#39;re Lorenzo De la Torre. Don&#39;t let anyone, not even someone as talented as Margaret, take control of your life or emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded slowly, caught between his mother&#39;s warmth and the coldness he knew hid behind her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t trust her -she continued-, but don&#39;t lower your guard either. That woman is intelligent, perhaps too much. And you need to stay in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo pressed his lips together. His mother had an almost supernatural ability to sow doubts in his mind, but at that moment, he couldn&#39;t help thinking she might be right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thank you, Mother -he murmured, rising from the bench.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped him for a moment, grabbing his wrist with unexpected strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Remember, Lorenzo, I&#39;m always here for you. No one knows you better than I do. And no one loves you like I do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was sweet, almost maternal, but Lorenzo felt a shiver run down his spine. She gave him one last smile before returning to her orchids, trimming imperfections with surgical precision, as if that small act was a metaphor for how she handled everything in her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo left the greenhouse with more questions than answers. His mother&#39;s words kept echoing in his head, and although he wanted to ignore them, he knew she never spoke without a purpose. What did that &#34;coincidence&#34; about Mateo really mean? And how much more could Margaret be hiding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo closed the greenhouse door behind him, but his mother&#39;s words kept ringing in his mind. &#34;His eyes are like yours when you were little.&#34; That seemingly innocent comment had become a thorn lodged in his consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He headed to his office, seeking refuge among the papers and numbers that usually managed to distract him. But this time, neither the company&#39;s finances nor Margaret&#39;s new designs could calm the whirlwind of thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mateo is three years old.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phrase appeared out of nowhere, clear and devastating. Lorenzo stopped in his tracks. Three years ago... What had happened exactly during that time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amelia&#39;s face came to his mind, an image so vivid he could almost feel her presence. He recalled the days before her disappearance: the tension in her eyes, the arguments that had begun to wear down their marriage, and then, nothing. Amelia had simply left, leaving a void he&#39;d filled with work and emotional walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now... if Margaret was really Amelia, and Mateo was three years old...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat at his desk, drumming his fingers against the wooden surface. The possibility was as absurd as it was unsettling. What if Mateo was his son?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That doesn&#39;t make sense,&#34; he thought, trying to find logical reasons to dismiss the idea. Amelia wouldn&#39;t have hidden something like that... or would she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his phone. It was a message from Margaret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. De la Torre, I&#39;ve just sent you the final sketches. I await your feedback for Monday&#39;s meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo read the message over and over, looking for something that might betray her-a sign that confirmed his fears. But as always, Margaret maintained her impeccable professionalism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put the phone aside and jumped to his feet. He needed answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, while reviewing the photos from the event where Mateo appeared, he realized that the way the boy smiled, the way he tilted his head... were painfully familiar details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to find the truth, Lorenzo grabbed his coat and left the mansion. His destination was clear: he had to talk to Adrien.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien received him at a restaurant with a mix of surprise and caution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Lorenzo -he said, crossing his arms-. I didn&#39;t expect to see you at this hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I can&#39;t wait any longer -Lorenzo replied, sitting beside him. His tone was serious, almost cutting-. I need you to tell me the truth, Adrien.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien frowned but said nothing. Lorenzo continued:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You know more than you&#39;re letting on. From the beginning, I&#39;ve noticed your relationship with Margaret is... strange. But now I have another theory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien remained silent, only fueling Lorenzo&#39;s frustration.</p>
