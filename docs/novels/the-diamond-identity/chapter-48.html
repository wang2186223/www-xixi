                <p>The clock marked the afternoon when Margaret arrived at her apartment, her face tired from the intensity of the past few days. Each step she took felt heavier than the last, and her mind was in a constant battle. Lorenzo, Mateo, Adrien All the threads of her life were beginning to intertwine in unexpected ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she entered, the sound of the phone broke the silence of her apartment. It was Adrien. She stared at it for a moment before answering, wondering if her friend had something to tell her about the situation with Lorenzo. With a sigh, she accepted the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Adrien? -said Margaret, trying to sound calm, but knowing there must be something urgent for him to call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Margaret, I need you to listen to me -Adrien said immediately, his voice serious, which made her tense up instantly. The usual calmness in his voice was gone, and that could only mean one thing: something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What&#39;s happening? -Margaret asked, feeling a mix of anxiety and confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I have to leave the country. -Adrien&#39;s words were direct but filled with an emotional weight that Margaret couldn&#39;t ignore. -Something important has come up, and I can&#39;t stay here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret&#39;s chest tightened upon hearing the news. Adrien, her close friend, her unconditional support Why did he have to leave so suddenly? Something in his voice unsettled her, and immediately doubt and fear began to fill her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-What happened? Why so suddenly? -Margaret asked, trying not to sound too worried, although she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I can&#39;t explain everything, not now -Adrien replied, his tone still serious and tense. -There are circumstances beyond my control, and I need to act fast. But believe me, it&#39;s not something I can postpone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret felt the air escape from her lungs as she heard the urgency in his words. The fact that he couldn&#39;t tell her all the details only increased the anxiety she felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-When are you leaving? -she asked, almost without thinking, feeling a knot form in her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Tomorrow -Adrien answered without hesitation. -I know, it&#39;s fast, but it&#39;s the only option I have right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret stayed silent for a moment, processing what she had just heard. Everything had changed so suddenly, and what worried her most was the feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. Adrien had never been like this, always so sure and confident. The uncertainty in his voice was disarming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Adrien, please, tell me what&#39;s going on. I&#39;m worried that you&#39;re hiding something from me -she said, almost pleading. -You&#39;re my friend, and if you need help, you know you can count on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a long silence on the other end of the line, as if Adrien was carefully considering his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s complicated, Margaret. I promise I&#39;ll tell you everything eventually. But right now all I can say is that it&#39;s something I can&#39;t avoid. I&#39;m really sorry, but I have to do it. -His voice sounded grave, as if he were saying it with a heavy heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fear in Margaret&#39;s chest grew, and something inside her told her that there was more to this farewell than Adrien was willing to admit. But, for now, she couldn&#39;t press him further. If Adrien didn&#39;t want to talk, there was nothing she could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Are you going to leave me here alone? -she asked with a mix of sadness and frustration. -You&#39;ve always been my support, Adrien. I don&#39;t want to lose you now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It&#39;s not a final goodbye, Margaret -Adrien replied, his tone softer. -I promise I&#39;ll come back when I can. But for now, I have to do this. Just be patient with me, okay?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret closed her eyes, trying to find the strength to understand the situation. She didn&#39;t like what she was hearing, but if there was one thing she had learned from Adrien, it was that, even if his decisions seemed impulsive, they always had a reason behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Alright I&#39;ll wait for you, Adrien. But promise me I won&#39;t lose you forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I promise -he replied, and there was something in his voice that reassured her, but at the same time, made her even more uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended, and Margaret stayed silent, staring at the phone in her hands. The feeling of unease wouldn&#39;t leave her, and she wondered if everything was somehow connected. Adrien had secrets, and she felt that important details were slipping through her fingers, things she couldn&#39;t understand yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy heart, Margaret placed the phone on the table and looked out the window. The sky was darkening, and the city lights shone like little points of hope. But inside, everything seemed to cloud over. What was happening? Why was everything falling apart so suddenly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to lose Adrien, but the weight of uncertainty crushed her. And what if this change of plans was just the beginning of something much bigger surrounding her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doubt and fear mixed in her chest, and for a moment, all she wanted was to be able to control the situation, as if she could fix it just by wishing for it. But she couldn&#39;t. The chaos in her mind told her to take control, to resolve everything right away, but she knew it wasn&#39;t in her hands. She couldn&#39;t force people to tell the truth, nor could she make secrets reveal themselves when she wanted. There was only a feeling of helplessness, that everything around her was spinning out of control and she couldn&#39;t stop it. The idea of waiting, of staying in this emotional limbo, filled her with despair. The anxiety was consuming her from within, like a flame feeding off her own fears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found herself trapped between the desire for answers and the inability to get them. What was happening? Why did everything seem to be falling apart so quickly? Her heart was racing, and her mind, in its attempt to find some sort of logic, went over every detail, trying to find a clue that would guide her to the truth. But everything was confusing, uncertain. Nothing made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked out the window, as if the sky could give her some kind of answer, but the darkness only increased the feeling of emptiness. The city shone, but she couldn&#39;t see beyond the fog that clouded her thoughts. She was alone, truly alone, in the middle of a sea of questions without answers. And the worst part was that, even though everyone around her seemed to keep moving forward, she felt trapped in a moment she couldn&#39;t control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she wanted was to find the key, that missing piece of the puzzle. She wanted to understand Adrien&#39;s decisions, to know why he had suddenly made the choice to leave without giving her full explanations. She wanted to understand Lorenzo, to know if her relationship with him truly had a future or if everything was about to fall apart. She wanted to understand herself, to know what she wanted from all of this. But the answers weren&#39;t coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The future was uncertain, and Margaret could only wait for the pieces of the puzzle to fall into place on their own. She knew she couldn&#39;t force it. But she also knew that, for now, time had become her greatest enemy. With each passing second, the uncertainty grew bigger, heavier. The fear of the unknown, of what could come, invaded and paralyzed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down on the couch, hugging herself, trying to find comfort in such a simple gesture. But the truth was, she couldn&#39;t find comfort in anything. The questions kept buzzing in her mind, and she didn&#39;t know how to quiet them. What would happen if she couldn&#39;t handle all of this? If the decisions she made in the next few days changed her life forever?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The future was still an enigma, and inside her, the feeling of facing something she couldn&#39;t control, something she couldn&#39;t avoid, filled her with anxiety. But at the same time, something in her heart told her she had to be patient, that time would eventually reveal what she needed to know. If only she could trust that the pieces of the puzzle would fit in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But, for now, all she could do was wait. And waiting, although she wished with all her might, didn&#39;t mean having control over what would come next.</p>
