                <p>When he opened the door, the sight of the woman standing before him left him paralyzed. Ana, his first love-the woman who had vanished from his life six long years ago-was there, right in front of him. Although he had been expecting her, her presence still caught him off guard. For a moment, Adrien thought his eyes were playing tricks on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Ana... -Adrien whispered, barely able to believe what he was seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him with an expression that carried both sorrow and pain. Time had not spared her, but there was something in her face that spoke of the heavy burden she had been carrying in her chest all these years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Adrien... -Ana said, her voice trembling-. I need to talk to you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain in her eyes made Adrien&#39;s heart race. Everything he had kept bottled up inside during these years-all the memories and unanswered questions-seemed to flood his mind at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why...? Why did you disappear without saying anything? -Adrien asked, his voice filled with a mixture of anger and confusion. The wounds of the past were still raw, and he couldn&#39;t stop himself from remembering the pain her sudden departure had caused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana swallowed hard, her eyes shimmering with restrained emotion. She took a deep breath and began to speak slowly, as if every word was a heavy weight she struggled to carry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-It wasn&#39;t my choice -she said, lowering her gaze before looking back at him. Her voice was soft, filled with regret-. Your mother... she forced me to leave. She pressured me to have an abortion, Adrien. She told me we could never be together, that I wasn&#39;t ready to be a mother. She made me leave you, leave everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien blinked, stunned. Ana&#39;s words hit him like a thunderbolt. His mind raced with memories that now seemed to take on a completely different meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-My mother... forced you to leave? -he said, more to himself than to her. He had never known the truth behind her departure, but now everything seemed to fit into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana nodded, her expression heavy with sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes. The pressure was so overwhelming, I couldn&#39;t resist. I had to walk away from everything, even you. I didn&#39;t want to, but I was afraid-for my life and for... -She paused before continuing-. And I left the city, changed my name, started over... all to escape what your mother demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger began to mix with confusion inside Adrien. He remembered his mother as a controlling woman, but he couldn&#39;t believe she had interfered so deeply in his life-and Ana&#39;s. Yet, that wasn&#39;t the only thing keeping him in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-And now what? -he asked, his voice laced with frustration and a desperate need for answers. Why are you back now, after all this time? Why now, after everything that&#39;s happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana met his eyes, and the seriousness in her expression made Adrien feel that something far bigger than the past was at stake. She stepped closer to him, her hands trembling slightly, but her voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Because we have a daughter, Adrien. -Her confession dropped like a bomb-. And she needs a bone marrow transplant. You&#39;re her only compatible donor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of her words left him breathless. A child. His child. He had never imagined life could throw such a dramatic twist at him, especially after so many years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-A child? -he whispered, his voice barely audible. Why didn&#39;t you ever tell me? Why did you keep all of this from me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana lowered her gaze, her face reflecting deep pain. Telling him this wasn&#39;t easy, but she knew it was something she had to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I didn&#39;t know how to tell you, Adrien. -Her voice trembled. -It was a decision I made alone, one I wasn&#39;t ready to face. But he&#39;s here now, and he&#39;s the most important thing. He needs you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion and pain took hold of Adrien. His mind couldn&#39;t process what he had just heard, and his heart wavered between lost love, anger at the betrayal, and fear of what this newly discovered child meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Why didn&#39;t you tell me before, Ana? -he asked, his voice breaking with anguish. -Why did you let me live with this lie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-I thought it was best to keep you away from all of it Your mother didn&#39;t want this child -she answered, tears streaming down her face. -I was afraid I&#39;d lose your love, that you wouldn&#39;t forgive me. But now, he&#39;s in danger. He needs you more than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien closed his eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath. The weight of the revelation was overwhelming, and while his heart still burned with unanswered questions, all he could think about was that he had to do the right thing for the child he had just learned was his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana watched him, as if waiting for something more, something that could ease her own pain. Adrien couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that there was something else she wasn&#39;t telling him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Is there more I should know? -he asked, his voice tired but firm. He knew her words couldn&#39;t be the full story. He needed to be prepared for whatever was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana averted her gaze, searching for the right words. Finally, with a trembling voice, she began to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Adrien, it wasn&#39;t just your mother who pressured me. It was the situation, the circumstances everything was chaos. I didn&#39;t know how to tell you I was pregnant. I didn&#39;t want to affect your career, didn&#39;t want your life to change overnight. The easiest thing was to walk away, to disappear but the child he deserves to know who his father is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien felt a knot form in his stomach as he heard the guilt in Ana&#39;s voice. The weight of their decisions crushed him, and in that moment, he wished things could have been different. Why hadn&#39;t she told him earlier? Why had she disappeared so suddenly? His anger mingled with compassion, and while his heart still burned from the wounds of the past, something inside him urged him to move forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-So all this time...? -he began, but the anguish in his voice stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana nodded, unable to meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Yes. All this time, it&#39;s been for him. -She sighed deeply, as if releasing a burden she had carried for years. -I know it wasn&#39;t right. I failed you but I didn&#39;t want you to live with the memory of a mistake I made. I didn&#39;t want to drag you into my pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien felt the weight of her words, but something within him kept him grounded. The child he hadn&#39;t known about deserved a chance. The child who was now an irremovable part of his life needed to know his father was willing to fight for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-You won&#39;t carry this alone anymore, Ana. -Adrien said, meeting her gaze. -I&#39;ll help you. I&#39;ll do everything I can. No matter what happened, this child is my responsibility too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ana, surprised by his words, let out a faint smile of gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Thank you, Adrien. -she said, her eyes filling with tears. -I don&#39;t know how to thank you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrien looked at her for a moment, his thoughts now focused on what mattered. He couldn&#39;t change the past, couldn&#39;t erase the decisions that had been made, but he could be the man this child needed now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-We&#39;ll do this together, Ana. -Adrien said, his voice filled with determination. -And no matter what happens, I won&#39;t let him feel alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their conversation hung in the air as silence enveloped them. Both stood there, realizing how fate had brought them back together in a way neither had anticipated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the road ahead wouldn&#39;t be easy. The decisions they made would not only affect their lives but also that of a child who, though unaware of what lay ahead, would be the one to unite them despite everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mix of hope and fear, Adrien made a decision that would change the course of his life. He wouldn&#39;t let his son grow up not knowing who his father was. He wouldn&#39;t let the shadows of the past tear them apart again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The future was uncertain, but in that moment, Adrien knew he had a reason to keep moving forward. After Ana said goodbye, Adrien was left deep in thought.</p>
