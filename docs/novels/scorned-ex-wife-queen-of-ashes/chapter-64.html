                <p>Camille&#39;s point of view</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning sun filled my home office,bathing the pristine white furniture in golden light that should have been soothing. Instead, I stared at my tablet screen, my chest so tight I could barely breathe.The headline of the Wall Street Journal&#39;s business section screamed at me in bold black letters:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**LEWIS INDUSTRIES TO RESCUE RODRIGUEZ SHIPPING WITH $100M INVESTMENT**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The subheading twisted the knife deeper:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Wedding Bells to Follow: Rodriguez-Lewis Union Cements Business Partnership**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My coffee cup crashed to the floor as I stood abruptly, hot liquid splattering across imported marble tiles. I didn&#39;t care. The words on the screen burned through my mind, erasing months of careful planning, of systematic destruction, of what should have been complete victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO,&#34;1I whispered, my voice trembling with emotion l rarely allowed myself anymore.&#34;No,no,NO!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scrolled through the article, each paragraph feeding the fire growing inside me:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*In a surprising turn of events, Lewis Industries has announced a $100 million investment in Rodriguez Shipping&#39;s Seattle operations, rescuing the century-old family business from complete collapse following Kane Industries&#39; recent debt acquisition.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Sources close to both families confirm that the business alliance will be strengthened by personal ties, with an October wedding planned between Stefan Rodriguez and Rose Lewis, sister of the late Camille Lewis-Rodriguez.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;This partnership represents not just a business opportunity, but the joining of two family legacies,&#34; Richard Lewis stated in this morning&#39;s press conference. &#34;Sometimes tragedy can lead to unexpected new beginnings.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tablet flew from my hands before I realized I&#39;d thrown it, shattering against the far wall in a spray of glass and electronics. The destruction wasn&#39;t enough. Nothing could quiet the storm raging inside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everything I&#39;d done. After buying his company&#39;s debt. After taking his family home. After systematically destroying everything the Rodriguez name stood for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan was still choosing Rose. Still moving forward with the life they&#39;d planned while I was supposedly dead at the bottom of that river.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And my parents - MY PARENTS - were funding it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My intercom buzzed, Rebecca&#39;s voice careful and measured: &#34;Ms. Kane? I assume you&#39;ve seen the news. Victoria is on the secure line.&#34; I forced myself to take three deep breaths before responding. &#34;Send the call through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s face appeared on my wall screen, her expression controlled but fury evident in the tightness around her eyes. She was in her Tokyo hotel suite, the skyline visible behind her through floor-to-ceiling windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is unacceptable,&#34; she said without greeting.&#34;All our careful work, undone by a simple investment deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They can&#39;t do this,&#34; I replied, pacing the length of my office.&#34;We own the debt. We control the assets.How can Lewis Industries possibly...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re not buying the company,&#34; Victoria interrupted. &#34;They&#39;re creating a new entity, using the few assets we couldn&#39;t touch, primarily the Seattle operations we thought were too worthless to bother with. Your father has found a legal workaround that keeps the Rodriguez name alive, if significantly diminished.&#34; The word &#34;father&#34; sent fresh pain shooting through me. Richard Lewis was funding the revival of Stefan&#39;s business, cementing Rose&#39;s triumph, all while having no idea he was destroying his supposedly dead daughter&#39;s carefully executed revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The wedding announcement wasn&#39;t coincidental,&#34;Victoria continued, her analytical mind already dissecting the strategy. &#34;It&#39;s a deliberate message to investors and clients, a statement of confidence in the new venture. The Rodriguez-Lewis union creates stability, continuity, tradition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want it stopped.&#34; My voice came out harder than I&#39;d ever heard it. &#34;All of it. The investment. The business aliance. The wedding. I want it all burned to the ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria studied me through the screen, her gaze softening slightly, a rare glimpse of the maternal concern she typically kept hidden beneath her formidable exterior. &#34;This is why l&#39;ve always cautioned against emotional involvement in business matters. You&#39;re taking this personally.&#34; &#34;Of course I&#39;m taking it personally!&#34; I slammed my hand against my desk, welcoming the physical pain.&#34;It IS personal. It&#39;s MY revenge they&#39;re unraveling.MY justice being denied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your revenge isn&#39;t complete,&#34; Victoria said calmly.&#34;This is merely an unexpected development requiing tactical adjustment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tactical adjustment?&#34; I laughed, the sound sharp and bitter even to my own ears. &#34;They&#39;re getting MARRIED, Victoria. With my parents&#39; blessing and financial support. After everything they did to me.After everything we&#39;ve done to destroy them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And they will still pay. Perhaps more completely than before.&#34; Victoria leaned closer to the camera, her expression intensifying. &#34;This development presents new opportunities. They&#39;re rebuilding, investing emotions and resources into a future they believe is secure. When we destroy that future, the pain will be magnified considerably.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her logic should have calmed me. Should have helped me see past the raw hurt to the strategic implications. Instead, I felt something crack inside,some final piece of the woman I&#39;d once been breaking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel like everything wNe&#39;ve done was for nothing,&#34; I said, collapsing back into my chair. &#34;They still win in the end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s expression shifted, calculation replacing concern. &#34;Perhaps we&#39;ve been too... indirect in our approach.&#34; A small, dangerous smile curved her lips.&#34;We need to create a scandal that will completely destroy your sister Rose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up sharply. &#34;What kind of scandal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The kind that would make your parents reconsider their support. The kind that would make Stefan question his choice.&#34; Victoria tapped her fingers against her desk, a habit I knew indicated she was carefully considering her next words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breath caught. &#34;That is a good plan&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Recently, I acquired proof and witnesses of all of Rose scandals&#34; Victoria&#39;s expression was unreadable. &#34;I held it in reserve, uncertain if such a personal attack would serve our larger goals. But now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now it&#39;s exactly what we need,&#34; I finished, a cold clarity replacing the emotional turmoil I&#39;d felt moments before. &#34;Evidence that Rose is not a saint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Show me,&#34; I demanded, leaning toward the screen.&#34;Show me what you have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I return tomorrow. This isn&#39;t something to discuss over even our most secure channels.&#34;Victoria&#39;s expression softened again, nearly imperceptible but there for those who knew how to read her. &#34;For now, maintain appearances. The charity luncheon at the Botanical Gardens is still on your schedule for today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not in the mood for smiling at socialites.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nevertheless, you will attend.&#34; Victoria&#39;s tone brooked no argument, maternal authority overlaying business command. &#34;Now more than ever, Camille Kane must appear unaffected by Rodriguez-Lewis affairs. Any reaction could raise questions we don&#39;t want asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, I showered and dressed mechanically,donning a pale blue suit that Rebecca had selected for the luncheon. My outward appearance perfectly matched what was expected of Victoria Kane&#39;s heir, polished, professional,poised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, I was burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My car was waiting when I descended the mansion&#39;s grand staircase. James stood by the open door, his expression professionally blank as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Botanical Gardens, Ms. Kane?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I decided suddenly. &#34;Take me to the Rodriguez estate first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James hesitated, unusual for him. &#34;Ms. Kane, the property is no longer...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s no longer in Rodriguez hands. I know we own it. I just... need to see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, closing my door before sliding into the driver&#39;s seat. As the car wound through exclusive neighborhoods where Manhattan&#39;s elite maintained their family compounds, I stared out the window without really seeing the passing scenery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Rodriguez estate had been in their family for five generations. I&#39;d lived there for three years as Stefan&#39;s wife, trying desperately to fit into spaces that had never truly welcomed me. Now it stood empty, another asset in Kane Industries&#39; portfolio,another piece of the Rodriguez legacy stripped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except now Stefan was rebuilding that legacy. With Rose by his side. With my parents&#39; money and blessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car slowed as we approached the private road leading to the estate. James paused at the security gate, showing identification to the guard Victoria had stationed there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re just driving past,&#34; he explained. &#34;Ms. Kane wanted to view the property.&#34; The guard nodded, raising the barrier to allow us through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driveway curved through manicured grounds,revealing the mansion gradually as we approached.Colonial architecture, white columns, windows gleaming in the morning sunlight. It looked exactly as I remembered from my years living there, except for the stillness. No staff moving about the grounds. No cars in the circular drive. Just empty perfection,preserved like a museum exhibit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop here,&#34; I instructed as we reached the front of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to go inside, Ms. Kane? I have the access codes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I wasn&#39;t ready for that, wasn&#39;t sure l&#39;d ever be ready to walk through rooms filled with memories of my failed marriage. &#34;This is close enough.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the car window, I studied the home that had never truly felt like mine despite my best efforts.Stefan&#39;s mother had made sure of that, with her constant remarks about traditions I didn&#39;t understand and standards | couldn&#39;t quite meet. Even the furniture had belonged to previous Rodriguez wives,selected and arranged generations before I arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rose would fit perfectly here. Would know exactly how to play the role of Rodriguez wife, just as she&#39;d always excelled at being the perfect Lewis daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought sent fresh pain spiraling through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re not moving back here,&#34; I said aloud,decision crystallizing as I spoke. &#34;Even if the new business succeeds. Even if the wedding proceeds.They will never live in this house again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James met my eyes in the rearview mirror. &#34;What would you like done with the property, Ms.Kane?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I considered the question, looking at the grand house that represented everything the Rodriguez name stood for, tradition, wealth, unbroken lineage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sell it,&#34; I said finally. &#34;Not to another family. To developers. I want it torn down, the land divided into</p>
                
                
                
                <p>smaller lots.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James nodded, making a note on his phone. He didn&#39;t question the decision that would erase a historic property, didn&#39;t comment on the destructiveness of the order. Victoria hired people who followed instructions without judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now the Botanical Gardens,&#34; I said, turning away as we pulled back down the driveway. &#34;I have a charity luncheon to attend.&#34;</p>
