                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyebrows rose slightly. &#34;Explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kane Industries stock is up nearly eight percent since market opening. Pierce Technologies up over nine percent. The market clearly approves of the perceived connection.&#34; Rebecca scrolled through her notes.&#34;Social media sentiment analysis shows ninety-three percent positive reaction to the... pairing.The PR team believes this presents a unique opportunity to strengthen both the Kane Industries brand and Ms.Kane&#39;s personal public image.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s expression remained unchanged,but Camille caught the slight tightening of her fingers on the tablet, the only outward sign of her displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Public perception is notoriously fickle,&#34; Victoria replied. &#34;Today&#39;s approval can become tomorrow&#39;s scandal. We built Camille&#39;s image on foundations of dignity, intelligence, grace and appropriate distance.Not tabloid romance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With respect,&#34; Rebecca continued, clearly aware she was treading dangerous ground, &#34;the team believes this development humanizes Ms. Kane in ways fifteen  months of careful image management never achieved.The public has respected her, but now they&#39;re connecting with her emotionally. That creates loyalty beyond business considerations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille watched the exchange with growing interest Rebecca making a direct case against Victoria&#39;s preferred approach was unprecedented. The PR team risking Victoria&#39;s disapproval suggested they truly believed this development benefited Kane Industries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what exactly are they recommending?&#34; Victoria asked,voice deceptively mild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither confirmation nor denial. Allow the speculation to continue. Maintain normal business operations while permitting the narrative to develop organically.&#34; Rebecca glanced briefly at Camille before continuing. &#34;They&#39;ve prepared three potential public appearances where Ms. Kane might be seen without directly addressing the rumors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria handed the tablet back to Rebecca. &#34;Tell them I&#39;ll consider their recommendations and provide direction this afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Rebecca departed, silence filled the room again.Victoria moved to stand near the windows, back straight,hands clasped behind her. Her thinking pose,one Camille had observed countless times during strategy sessions. &#34;The PR team makes valid points from a business perspective,&#34; Victoria said finally. &#34;The market reaction is significant. The public engagement metrics show clear advantages.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille waited, knowing there was more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But they don&#39;t understand what&#39;s truly at stake.&#34;Victoria turned to face her. &#34;This isn&#39;t just about stock prices or public perception. This is about completing what we started. About justice for what was done to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reminder sent memories flooding back, Rose&#39;s betrayal, Stefan&#39;s abandonment, her parents blindness to manipulation happening before their eyes. The systematic destruction of Camille Lewis&#39;s life,orchestrated by those who should have protected her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pierce is a complication we didn&#39;t anticipate,&#34; Victoria continued. &#34;A variable that could disrupt everything we&#39;ve built. Whatever his motives, whatever his interest in you, we cannot afford the distraction he represents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille looked down at her phone, remembering Alexander&#39;s last message. The phoenix looks toward the sun, not back at the ashes it rose from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if...&#34; she began carefully, &#34;what if we could use this to our advantage? The attention. The connection people believe exists between Pierce and me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly.&#34;HOW?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rose and Stefan monitor business news obsessively now that their companies are failing. They&#39;ll have seen this morning&#39;s coverage. The speculation about Pierce and Kane Industries potentially aligning.&#34; Camille stood, moving to the dressing table where the necklace still lay. &#34;Imagine their reaction. Their growing desperation as they see not just their personal lives crumbling, but potential business alliances forming that could crush any hope of recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding dawned in Victoria&#39;s expression. &#34;You&#39;re suggesting we allow the speculation to continue. Not for public relations benefits, but as another weapon in our arsenal against them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly.&#34; Camille lifted the necklace, diamonds catching morning light. &#34;Let them see me not just taking everything they valued, but gaining things they never had.Power. Connections. Potential alliance with the one man whose resources is bigger than yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria considered this, head tilted slightly.interesting approach. Psychological warfare beyond mere financial destruction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It adds another dimension to their defeat,&#34; Camille agreed. &#34;Not just losing everything they built, but watching me potentially gain everything they could never achieve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For several moments, Victoria said nothing, clearly weighing the proposal against her concerns. Finally,she nodded once, decision made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll delay returning the necklace. Allow the speculation to continue for now. But,&#34; her voice hardened again, &#34;we maintain control of the narrative.No unplanned interactions with Pierce. No statements without my approval. No deviations from our core strategy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; Camille agreed, relief washing through her for reasons she wasn&#39;t ready to examine too closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria moved toward the door, pausing before leaving. &#34;One more thing, Camille. Do not trust Alexander Pierce. Whatever his interest in you appears to be, remember that men like him always have deeper motives than they reveal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Victoria departed, Camille returned to the window, necklace still clutched in her hand. Outside,spring had transformed the mansion&#39;s gardens, new growth pushing through soil that had been frozen just weeks earlier. Life emerging after dormancy. Beauty following barrenness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed with another text from Alexander: *Has the storm arrived yet? Victoria&#39;s plane landed twenty minutes ago.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled despite herself, typing back: *Storm weathered. The necklace stays, for now.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His response came quickly: *The phoenix gains wisdom.Looking forward to our next encounter, little warrior.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille traced the diamonds with her fingertip,remembering the weight of Alexander&#39;s hands at her neck, the warmth of his breath near her ear. For months she had focused solely on destroying Rose and Stefan, on executing Victoria&#39;s careful plan for justice through systematic revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, for the first time, she found herself looking beyond that single goal. Wondering what might exist after revenge was complete. Who she might become when hatred no longer defined her purpose</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phoenix looks toward the sun, not back at the ashes it rose from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps Alexander Pierce wasn&#39;t just a complication in Victoria&#39;s carefully orchestrated plan. Perhaps he was something else entirely, a glimpse of possibility beyond the single-minded focus on revenge that had consumed her since the night she&#39;d signed those divorce papers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought should have frightened her. Instead, she found herself smiling as she slipped the diamond necklace back into its velvet box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was right about one thing, Alexander Pierce was dangerous. But not perhaps in the way she believed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real danger wasn&#39;t to their revenge plan, but to the walls Camille had built around her heart since the night she&#39;d died as Camille Lewis and been reborn as Camille Kane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walls that, for the first time since her transformation,showed signs of beginning to crack.</p>
