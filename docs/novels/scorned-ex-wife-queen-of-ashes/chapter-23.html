                <p>ROSE&#39;S POINT OF VIEW</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shoe sat on Detective Ramirez&#39;s desk between us. A woman&#39;s size seven pump, once black, now gray-green from three months underwater. The heel had broken off, but the designer&#39;s red sole remained visible.Louboutin.Unmistakably Camille&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this your sister&#39;s shoe, Ms. Lewis?&#34; Detective Ramirez asked, his tired eyes watching my reaction carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached for it with trembling fingers, a calculated tremor l&#39;d practiced thatmorning.whispered,voice breaking on cue. &#34;She wore these the last time I saw her. A gift from our parents for her birthday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lie slid out smoothly. In truth, I&#39;d given Camille those shoes when she landed her first job, playing the generous big sister while privately mocking her pathetic excitement over my hand-me-downs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does seeing this personal item bring up any new thoughts about your sister&#39;s state of mind before her disappearance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An interesting question. Not &#34;accident&#34; or&#34;drowning,&#34;but&#34;disappearance.&#34; The detective&#39;s word choice revealed his lingering doubts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your parents mentioned Camille kept journals,&#34; he continued. &#34;Have you had a chance to read them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Mom had spoken to the police about the journals. This was worse than I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I couldn&#39;t bear to read them,&#34; I said, looking away as if overcome. &#34;Too painful. Mom mentioned she found some, but she&#39;s been very private about their contents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And your relationship with Mr. Rodriguez? Your sister&#39;s ex-husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stefan and I have found comfort in our shared grief,&#34;I said carefully.&#34;Wwere friends before he and Camille dated. After a respectful period of mourning, we&#39;ve... reconnected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the station, I called Martin Greene, the family&#39;s trusted fixer. &#34;I need everything you can get on Detective Ramirez.And I need to know exactly what my mother told the police about Camille&#39;s journals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I headed to my parents&#39; house. Mom was at her weekly therapy appointment, an engagement I&#39;d encouraged to keep her sedated with grief counseling and antidepressants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house was quiet when I arrived. I moved through Camille&#39;s room methodically, checking obvious hiding places. Nothing. The floorboard Mom had mentioned yielded nothing but an empty space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom&#39;s private sitting room, then. The small sunlit space where she spent hours alone. On her writing desk sat a mahogany box with a brass lock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looking for something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom&#39;s voice from the doorway froze me in place. She stood watching me, more sober and alert than l&#39;d seen in months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,&#34; I said, forcing warmth into my voice. &#34;I didn&#39;t expect you back so soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved to the box, unlocked it, and withdrew a journal. &#34;September 14th, ten years ago: &#39;Rose told Jason I stuffed my bra before the dance. Now he won&#39;t talk to me. She says she was just joking, but she smiles when she thinks I&#39;m not looking.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind raced back. Jason Parker, Camille&#39;s first crush. I&#39;d spent weeks helping her get his attention, only to whisper that carefully crafted lie at precisely the right moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Teenage drama,&#34; I said dismissively. &#34;Camille was always sensitive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom took out another journal. &#34;April 2nd, eight years ago: &#39;Got my Stanford acceptance today. Rose says it&#39;s probably a mistake. Now I can&#39;t stop worrying they&#39;ll realize they didn&#39;t mean to accept me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was trying to,protect her from disappointment,&#34; I protested. &#34;Stanford is highly competitive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom slammed the journal shut. &#34;You know what happened next? She called the admissions office to &#39;confirm&#39; they wanted her. They thought she was having a mental health crisis. When we decided she wasn&#39;t ready for college, based largely on your concerns about her emotional stability, that call reinforced our decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time for the nuclear option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,&#34; I whispered, &#34;I didn&#39;t want to tell you this, but... Camille had problems none of us understood. The last time we spoke, she said things that frightened me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She talked about hearing voices sometimes. About feeling watched.&#34; The lies flowed smoothly,tailored to match symptoms I knew Mom feared. Her own mother had suffered from paranoid delusions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not possible,&#34; Mom said, but doubt had crept into her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would she write about it if she was hiding it? Mom, I&#39;ve been carrying this guilt for months, wondering if l should have told someone. If I could have prevented what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When her car went into the river,&#34; Icontinued softly, &#34;I wondered if... if it wasn&#39;t an accident. If maybe the voices told her to do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom sank into her chair, face ashen. &#34;I should have known. A mother should know when her child is suffering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You couldn&#39;t have known,&#34; I soothed, watching my carefully crafted lies take root. &#34;Camille was good at hiding things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to tell your father. And the detective.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure that&#39;s wise?&#34; | asked gently.&#34;Camille wanted this kept private. And mental health stigma is still so prevalent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps wait,&#34; I suggested. &#34;Read through the journals again, looking for signs you might have missed. Let me help you,&#34; I,offered, reaching for the box. &#34;Two sets of eyes might catch what one misses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated only briefly before nodding. The box of journals, the evidence I&#39;d been desperate to secure,was now being handed to me willingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I left an hour later, Mom looked lighter somehow. The poison of suspicion had been drained, replaced with a new narrative that absolved her of responsibility while redirecting her focus from me to Camille&#39;s fabricated mental health struggles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the car,l immediately texted Martin: *Cancel the Ramirez investigation. Situation contained.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the mahogany box beside me, I felt a surge of satisfaction. By tonight, any evidence of my careful dismantling of Camille&#39;s life would be ashes. And the official narrative would shift subtly, not an accident,not murder, but a troubled young woman&#39;s final desperate act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfect Rose, the devoted sister, carrying her tragic secret to protect her family&#39;s peace of mind. The story practically wrote itself. Mental illness was such a convenient explanation for inconvenient truths. Camille&#39;s real voice had been silenced forever in that river. Now I would ensure that even her written words told the story I chose for them to tell.</p>
