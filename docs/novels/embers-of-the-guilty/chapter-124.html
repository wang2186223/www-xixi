                <p>I replied, &#34;It&#39;s not your fault, Zoey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not your fault. He is him, and you are you. It&#39;s different. You can be in pain, disappointed, sad, and even cry to vent, but you don&#39;t need to, nor should you, take his mistakes upon yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I placed my hand on her shoulder and patted it gently. Her shoulders trembled even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must have been in tears, but she didn&#39;t want me to see it. In this situation, she really wanted to be alone for a while but couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;When I was little, I rarely saw him. He came home very late. I asked my mom where Dad was, and she said he was out catching bad guys. So I waited until he came back and put the little red flower the school awarded me on his chest, saying, &#39;Dad, you&#39;re awesome.&#39; I still remember how happy he was when he hugged me. He was really happy, and he wore it on his chest every time he came home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As I grew older, my parents divorced. I didn&#39;t understand what divorce meant at the time. Mr. Martin said it was the end of their relationship, and they would use the time they spent in their relationship to love me even more. From then on, I would receive two New Year gifts every year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Martin was good at talking and comforting me, but I knew I no longer had a home. My parents were always busy, and I hated the fake smiles of the nannies they hired. I felt they were all bought with money, and I didn&#39;t like it. I wanted to live at Mr. Martin&#39;s house, but I always felt that my own home was better. From the day they divorced, my home in my heart was gone, like a building that should have collapsed long ago, collapsing completely when I was eight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey spoke with increasing sobs, her back to me, constantly wiping her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued, &#34;I try to think positively, Nancy. I&#39;m an optimistic person. Mr. Martin said he was raising a daughter for my parents and that I should just call him dad. I strongly opposed it, not because I didn&#39;t have feelings for Mr. Martin. On the contrary, I would blur the line between these two men even more. Mr. Martin became more like my dad, while my dad became a familiar yet strange uncle. I couldn&#39;t betray my dad. I used to be Zoey Carter, but after my parents divorced, my mom made me change my last name to Taylor. My opposition was ineffective, and it was forcibly changed. Now, even the father-daughter relationship is gradually being lost. I feel guilty and reluctant towards him in my heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nancy, in my heart, he is a hero, a real man who has walked through fire and water without fear, who has solved big cases with his own skills step by step. I really miss him. I call him from time to time, but he&#39;s always busy. He says a few words and then hangs up. I know he loves me in his heart. I&#39;ve thought it through. I&#39;ll earn money seriously. He probably hasn&#39;t saved much for retirement. I&#39;ll buy him a house, cook for him from time to time, and make up for everything I owe him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey spoke while crying. How could she not understand that coming to Shadow City was a deliberate arrangement by Howard and Erica?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should she hate them? This wasn&#39;t about smearing Ronald but letting Zoey see the scene, seeing Ronald&#39;s ferocity, his disregard for life, and his madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob was right; no one in this world could make Ronald truly compromise. A young man withoutbackground had worked his way up to the state police department. No one could change his unwavering determination, and his desire for power.Except for his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his daughter appeared, his hand holding the gun relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was his only weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald didn&#39;t know that, but Howard and Erica did. So even at the risk, they entrusted Zoey to me. Only Zoey could stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like Ronald told Zoey, never rely on anyone, never let anyone use her, even with good intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because, at that moment, Ronald realized that it was all Howard and Erica&#39;s plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Howard and Erica hoped he would let go of his obsession and stop the killing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ronald&#39;s understanding was anger at being manipulated. I was a bit worried about Howard&#39;s situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, my phone rang. Howard had sent a message:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Nancy, I&#39;m sorry.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed Ronald had already contacted Howard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Why apologize?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fully understood. This was the real reason Howard was so invested in this case from the beginning. He and Erica might have known about Ronald&#39;s various actions long ago. They even knew from the start that Ronald was behind the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t persuade Ronald, and it was impossible to send him to prison because of their relationship and Zoey, as well as Ronald&#39;s status. He could only help me and guide me to uncover the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t blame Howard for hiding these things. On the contrary, I was very grateful to him. In this world, no one was obligated to help you. If someone helped you, it was a favor, but not a duty. He always acted out of goodwill, not for any other purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard replied concisely:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Zoey, Shadow City.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed and replied:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Only Zoey can stop Ronald in this world. Be careful over there. Ronald probably won&#39;t appreciate it.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Got it.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who should be most heartbroken were Howard and Erica. One was her biological mother, and the other was, in a sense, another father to Zoey. With so many years of feelings, they took such a big risk to let Zoey stop her biological father. From the moment Zoey got on the train, their hearts had been tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From another perspective, they did it for Ronald too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the bond between the three of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, Ronald never thought of this, and perhaps he never would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s appearance only pressed the pause button. It didn&#39;t mean Ronald wouldn&#39;t wake up again. I had a feeling Ronald wouldn&#39;t let this go easily.</p>
