                <p>After getting everything sorted, I started to rethink the whole situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First off, I realized that the relationship between Lally, Tammy, and Tony was pretty clear. And as for another witness, Tom, I figured he had to be connected with Tony and the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No doubt about it. If Tammy and Lally&#39;s testimonies were bogus, then Tom&#39;s final statement in court totally covered up the gaps in their stories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though the three of them had different takes, their goal seemed to be to go after Laura. When I brought up Laura, Tony&#39;s reaction was a dead giveaway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what about Tom? What kind of beef would a guy like him have with Laura that he&#39;d need to team up with these folks from Sand Village?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a social class angle, there shouldn&#39;t be any link. Then it hit me: could Zack and Tom know each other? Did they strike some kind of deal, with Tom giving false testimony? Also, I remember Tom saying in court that he was waiting for a client at the Entertainment Club. Could that client be Zack?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My boss, Howard, had mentioned before that Tom&#39;s business was tied to urban planning and construction, which just so happened to match the Sand Village demolition case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about this, I checked the time. It was almost midnight. Knowing Howard, he was definitely still up. Sure enough, he picked up after a few rings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up, Nancy?&#34; Howard asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you busy? I need to ask you something. Which company does Tom work for?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s got a few companies. If you need specifics, I&#39;ll have to check.&#34; Howard replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just the main one, the urban planning and construction one,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that one. It&#39;s called &#39;Dream of Sand Urban Planning and Investment Construction Co., Ltd.&#39;&#34; Howard said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jotted down the name on my phone and thought this needed to be fast-tracked. I couldn&#39;t wait until next week to see Tom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Howard, can we set up a meeting with Tom this week? I have a hunch there&#39;s something fishy going on. This guy must be linked to Lally and Tammy from Sand Village.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me think. It should be doable. I&#39;ll ask tomorrow and get back to you.&#34; Howard said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OK, also, do you know someone named Zack?&#34; I continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which Zack?&#34; Howard asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The one who organized the demolition team during the Sand Village case in 2019, the one who caused the fight. He should be Tony&#39;s brother.&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard thought for a moment and then said, &#34;Oh, him. I know of him but haven&#39;t met him. Wait, I remember now. The final compensation process for the Sand Village demolition case was handled by Tom. So, a lot of the news reports can be accessed firsthand. I&#39;ll set up a meeting with Tom tomorrow under the pretext of thanking him for his work on the case, and you can join us as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great! Thanks, Mr. Martin.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mention it! Let me know if you need anything.&#34; Howard said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough! There was a connection between Tom and Zack, and Tom also had ties to Sand Village.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened an app on my phone that specializes in company info and searched for &#34;Dream of Sand Urban Planning and Investment Construction Co., Ltd.&#34; Tom&#39;s name was listed among the shareholders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clicked on Tom&#39;s profile and found out he was involved in over a dozen companies. This guy had his hands in everything-design and construction, dining, fast-moving consumer goods, electronics, and even some overseas ventures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked each one but didn&#39;t find any names linked to Zack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exited and searched for Zack. There were tons of results, so I filtered for those related to real estate but still came up empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Sand Village demolition case was a big deal, involving both the government and real estate developers. A project that size couldn&#39;t be run by a small-time player.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zack, who could throw down $1.5 million in insurance, had to be in upper management, and his name should be somewhere in the company records.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he just vanish, existing only in the stories from the folks in Sand Village?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was definitely off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I searched for Tom again and checked all the companies where he was listed as a legal rep, executive, or investor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long and exhausting search, it was already 3 AM.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I found Tom listed as a shareholder in a multinational company. He had a small stake but held the CFO position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company was called &#34;C.K Internet,&#34; headquartered abroad, with its main office in Silverlight City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I kept digging, I found the name of the company&#39;s general manager and CEO, a name I should have thought of but had overlooked-Frank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom actually knew Frank!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I remembered Frank&#39;s expression when I first met him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he heard about Alan&#39;s death, he was devastated. But if they were truly close friends, hearing about the other&#39;s death wouldn&#39;t result in such a calm expression, especially for a witness in this case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony, Lally, and Tammy seemed to hate Laura deeply. What about Frank?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered Frank&#39;s reaction when he heard about Laura. His attitude towards her was no different from the others, but Frank explained that he had a relationship with Laura during college.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this be the source of their hatred for Laura?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, Frank, Laura, Mike, and Bob all came from the orphanage. Why didn&#39;t Frank mention this when we talked? Frank specifically said he became close to Alan in college.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But they had known each other since childhood!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frank was hiding something! He didn&#39;t tell the whole truth!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And all of this was centered around the orphanage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something must have happened ten or even twenty years ago, something significant involving Laura, leading these people down different paths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of this event, they began to hate Laura, and Alan must have played a role in it. Due to some accident, he met with misfortune, and these people directed all their anger and hatred towards Laura, determined to see her dead!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, this was a huge conspiracy involving Sand Village, the orphanage, and even Silverlight City and state-level leaders, causing the police, prosecutors, and court personnel investigating the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder case to be transferred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of this, my heart started racing, and my limbs went cold. This timeline spans over twenty years; the cases and people involved were all connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning to the present, the most important thing now was to investigate Tom, understand his connection with Frank, and find the vanished Zack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a vague feeling that Tony lied. He must be familiar with Frank, Mike, Bob, Laura, and the others. And their relationship was not shallow!</p>
