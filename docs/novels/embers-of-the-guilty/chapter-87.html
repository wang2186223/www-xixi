                <p>When I was almost there, it was around 4:30 PM. I turned left off the main road and spotted the &#34;Ronald Food Truck&#34; still parked there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald, with his greasy hair, was sitting on a chair, puffing on a cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He noticed a car coming, glanced my way, and slowly got up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing it was me, he grinned, &#34;Remember me? What brings you here today? Want another meal? It&#39;s on me. I felt bad about that pack of cigarettes last time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, &#34;I&#39;ll take the same burger as last time, but I&#39;m still paying. If it weren&#39;t for you, I might&#39;ve ended up working at this Entertainment Club, and that would&#39;ve been a nightmare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be kidding. You seem smart. Even if I hadn&#39;t said anything, you&#39;d have figured it out.&#34; With that, Ronald started making the burger with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In no time, the burger was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had already eaten earlier, but since it was made by Zoey&#39;s dad Ronald, and judging by his expression, he probably didn&#39;t know I had figured out who he was. Plus, it smelled amazing and was packed with meat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eat up, it&#39;s on me.&#34; Ronald was confident in his cooking. He lit another cigarette and kept smoking happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t resist taking a few more bites; the seasoning was spot on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was because I had confirmed Alan was still alive, my mood was way better, and so was my appetite. While munching, I said, &#34;Sir, you really have a knack for this. It tastes fantastic!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you&#39;re in a good mood, your appetite naturally improves. If it&#39;s not enough, I can whip up another one.&#34; Ronald grinned and chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know if I&#39;m in a good mood or not?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s obvious. People, whether happy or not, can&#39;t fake it. When they&#39;re truly happy, their eyes sparkle. When they&#39;re not, every move they make shows their sadness.&#34; Ronald kept smoking and said, &#34;That&#39;s my experience from years of running this food stand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about how Howard often took Zoey to eat when she was little and said, &#34;If your kid has eaten your burgers, they must be really happy, just like you said, their eyes would be full of smiles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald was taken aback for a moment, then smiled awkwardly and nodded, changing the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in mysteriously and asked, &#34;Miss, can I ask you something? Last time I saw you with the police here, something must have happened. There was even an ambulance. Did someone die?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but Lally got hurt. My apprentice and I took her to the hospital that day,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was it serious?&#34; Ronald asked, sounding concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not too bad, she woke up pretty soon. But now she&#39;s missing, and we can&#39;t find her. Do you know her, sir?&#34; I looked at him with a half-smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald turned around, wiped his sweat with the towel on his shoulder, and started cleaning the cooking utensils he had just used.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finished the burger quickly; my appetite was unusually good today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Want another one?&#34; Ronald asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, actually, I already ate earlier. But I wanted to see you. Last time we parted in a hurry, and I felt there were many things left unsaid.&#34; I wiped my mouth and sat on the small stool, smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald quickly cleaned the cooking area and finally responded, &#34;What do you want to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just thinking, if Zoey ate your food, she would be very happy, right?&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald paused, glanced at me, and his eyes changed completely. That sharp, eagle-like gaze flashed by. This was the demeanor honed by years as a professional detective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was the person he cared about the most. Earlier, he didn&#39;t use his real identity to talk to me, naturally appearing as a simple food stand owner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, when I mentioned Zoey&#39;s name and revealed his identity, that natural paternal vigilance immediately surged up, instinctively alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look in his eyes disappeared in an instant because he had seen Zoey and me together last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued working without saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you find out Joseph had a problem? Was it the True Love Entertainment Club murder case or the child trafficking case at the old steel factory in Sand Village over twenty years ago?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; Ronald looked up, scanning me up and down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although he looked greasy and unkempt, his demeanor had completely changed. That upright aura was overwhelming, and his voice was no longer lazy but naturally firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t Howard tell you? I thought he mentioned it. Nancy, editor-in-chief of the Silverlight City Legal Journal.&#34; I stood up and handed him the plate, &#34;I really like Zoey. She&#39;s my apprentice, and I treat her like a sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not that. I guessed your relationship when you and Benjamin came that day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald shook his head, then suddenly thought of something and smiled, &#34;Benjamin, that guy, has grown a lot over the years. If it were before, he would have come over to chat right away. Too obvious. That&#39;s why he&#39;s not suited to be an undercover cop. He can charge into battle and investigate clues, but with that brain, he&#39;d be dead on the second day as an undercover cop. His apprentice seems to be the same. Like master, like apprentice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled, &#34;You have a keen eye. Benjamin&#39;s mentor said the same thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because Benjamin&#39;s mentor, Albert Turner, is my friend. When Albert was selecting apprentices, I picked Benjamin for him.&#34; Ronald said with a smile, putting down his work, &#34;Enough reminiscing. I&#39;m grateful for your care of Zoey, but why are you interested in this case? Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My husband&#39;s name is Alan,&#34; I replied.</p>
