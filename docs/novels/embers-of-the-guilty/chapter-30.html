                <p>Benjamin gave an &#34;OK&#34; sign, showing he got it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cool, I&#39;m close by. I&#39;ll grab a ride-share and be there in about ten minutes.&#34; Tanner ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not a total bust,&#34; Benjamin said, running a hand through his hair and letting out a relieved sigh. &#34;Paul got nabbed a while back, but he&#39;s been stubborn, claiming he wasn&#39;t dealing drugs. His detention time is almost up, and without more proof, we&#39;d have to cut him loose. But now, we&#39;ve got a key witness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, Ruben, start setting things up,&#34; Benjamin said, giving Ruben a pat on the shoulder. Despite the slip-ups, this case had been Ruben&#39;s from the start, and he needed to see it through. As his mentor, Benjamin would back him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mr. Wright,&#34; Ruben replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking serious, Ruben checked the time and quickly gave instructions, &#34;It&#39;s been about two minutes since the call. Tanner, head up in about eight minutes. Ride-shares are usually on time, so don&#39;t go up early and tip them off. The club&#39;s packed and chaotic, so to avoid any screw-ups, Mr. Wright and I will go up two minutes later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got an idea. How about you two pose as VIPs, and I&#39;ll tag along?&#34; Billy suggested with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a police operation, not your place to speak!&#34; Ruben snapped at Billy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruben had always been wary of this club, so there was no way he&#39;d let Billy join them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his earlier rookie mistake, Ruben now had the decisive and upright demeanor of a seasoned detective. Benjamin had indeed not misjudged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These two are accompanying journalists. After we go up, you bring them up,&#34; Ruben said to Billy. Then he turned to us and said, &#34;Mrs. Smith, Ms. Taylor, be careful when you go up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed Ruben had trusted me and Zoey to keep an eye on Billy, a sign of trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey had looked uneasy since earlier. When I asked her quietly, she said she was fine. It was likely nerves from her first time accompanying detectives. I felt a pang of guilt. Even though we were just catching a drug user and had police protection, it was still somewhat dangerous. Zoey, still a student, might find this task too heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the time came, Tanner went into the club first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after, Benjamin and Ruben followed. Before leaving, Benjamin reminded us repeatedly to stay safe and leave immediately if the drug user acted up. Safety first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Billy and the two of us were left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy tried to make conversation, and I responded half-heartedly. We needed to complete the operation first, then investigate him. Zoey, now more composed, just smiled and didn&#39;t speak to Billy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the time came, Billy led us into the club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lobby was lavishly decorated, with a ceiling over 13 feet high and a huge crystal chandelier hanging in the middle, exuding luxury. A faint fragrance filled the air. As Billy led us to the elevator, Zoey whispered, &#34;Mrs. Smith, this club is really wealthy. The lobby looks like a palace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy seized the opportunity, giving a thumbs up, &#34;You know your stuff. The lobby&#39;s design is indeed modeled after a palace. Not just in the city, but in the whole state, you won&#39;t find another like it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Lopez, can you give us a rundown of the club&#39;s layout? Might be a good spot to bring clients next time,&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure thing! Just drop my name, and I&#39;ll hook you up with a discount!&#34; Billy, sensing a business opportunity, grinned even wider. &#34;So, the first floor has the lobby, offices, and staff quarters. The second and third floors have regular rooms, and the fifth and sixth floors are for VIPs. If you come by, let me know ahead of time, and I&#39;ll get you a VIP room at regular rates!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about the fourth floor?&#34; I asked, feeling a bit anxious since this was my first time so close to a crime scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The fourth floor...&#34; Billy started to explain, but the elevator doors opened, and a panicked staff member rushed out. Seeing Billy, he shouted, &#34;Mr. Lopez, come quick! Lally&#39;s getting beaten to death!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Lally! The crying girl on the phone earlier was Lally!&#39; I suddenly remembered, recognizing the voice. I bolted into the elevator, with Billy and Zoey right behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reached the third floor, I dashed out, with Zoey close on my heels. Billy yelled, &#34;Slow down, be careful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hallway was packed with staff. I pushed through the crowd and entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin was on the phone, and Ruben had a skinny guy pinned to the ground. It had to be Duke. Tanner stood silently, staring at Lally in the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood was splattered on the floor, along with torn clothes. Lally&#39;s bare upper body was covered with Benjamin&#39;s jacket. She was crouched in the corner, blood still trickling from her forehead. Her face was pale, her eyes empty and lifeless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tanner, you bastard! I knew you were no good!&#34; Duke, pinned by Ruben, kept cursing, &#34;Did you all sleep with Lally? One by one or all together? Was it exciting? Did you film it? Show me! Or how about we all go at it together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared coldly at Duke. He was naked, with needle marks covering the veins on his arms, thighs, and neck. Used disposable syringes lay on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of disgust washed over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Benjamin, help me pull out his left hand. I want to see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin easily pulled out Duke&#39;s left hand. Long-term drug use had emaciated him, making his hand look like a claw. But I could clearly see a tattoo of &#34;Lally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was Lally&#39;s boyfriend, the one who attacked Tony at Digital Leap Technologies Company months ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve called the station. They&#39;ll be here soon, and an ambulance is on the way,&#34; Benjamin said, showing his badge. &#34;Duke, you&#39;re under arrest for drug use, drug trafficking, and assault. Come with us to the station.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing &#34;police,&#34; Duke turned pale. The drug&#39;s effect seemed to wane, and he trembled, pleading, &#34;Lally, save me. Tell them you wanted to be hit. I&#39;ll listen to you from now on... Lally, say something. I don&#39;t want to go to jail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t use drugs! Where&#39;s your evidence? I&#39;m diabetic! I inject myself for treatment. You can&#39;t just arrest people! Let me go, or I&#39;ll call the police!&#34; Duke shouted hysterically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call who? I am the police!&#34; Ruben couldn&#39;t hold back, shouting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lally, save me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Duke call her repeatedly, Lally, who was crouching in the corner, twitched her fingers, and tears welled up in her vacant eyes.</p>
