                <p>I&#39;ve run into Frank twice now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first time, Howard was with me. Frank had just found out about Alan&#39;s death, and he seemed genuinely torn up, like he&#39;d just heard the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then I started having doubts. The second time I saw Frank, just a few days ago, he got all worked up talking about Laura and Anna&#39;s relationship. It felt like he was putting on a show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus, during that second meeting, he barely mentioned Alan, almost like he was waiting for me to bring it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that Frank wasn&#39;t even there that day? Maybe he was the mastermind, pulling the strings from afar. When he heard Alan was dead and the plan had gone south, he rushed back to figure out what went wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing I was digging into things and starting to question the witnesses, he showed up, trying to throw me off by pointing fingers at Laura. But I wasn&#39;t buying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, by process of elimination, the only two people left who were with Alan at True Love Entertainment Club that day were Mike and Bob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered calling them to check things out, and they both had alibis. But now, it seemed like they were lying too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looks like I need to take a trip out of town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking back, why did Joseph give me that bogus lead about Alan going to the club alone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There are two possibilities: either he was covering for Mike and Bob, or he was trying to steer me in the wrong direction. Maybe both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Considering how Alan acted all high and mighty in college, there was only one possibility: Joseph might have also escaped from the steel mill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Alan led a group of kids begging for food, and Joseph could&#39;ve been one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, it seemed crazy that all these people would end up in Silverlight City. But given the nightmare conditions at the steel mill, where so many kids died, the power of hatred can drive people to do anything, even wait for revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Leonard put on his coat, packed his stuff, and smiled, &#34;Looks like you&#39;ve figured it out. Come take a walk with me and tell me what you&#39;ve found out about Alan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He patted my shoulder and said, &#34;In this world, the people who truly care about you and are willing to help aren&#39;t just your apprentices, but also... your unacknowledged mentors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a pang of sadness and swallowed my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given the sensitive nature of this case, involving some big shots in the state, if I was being watched, Leonard could get dragged into it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;Forget it, I&#39;ll head out first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to be so cautious,&#34; Leonard seemed to read my mind and waved it off, &#34;At worst, we&#39;ll just dodge the surveillance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, we retraced our steps and snuck out of the company through the side door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard, the deputy director of the prosecutor&#39;s office and the company&#39;s second-in-command, sneaking out with me like a couple of thieves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Along the way, Leonard gave me a curious look, probably wondering how I knew the surveillance spots so well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the prosecutor&#39;s office was an old street. It was around 11 PM, and the place was pretty deserted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard and I walked down the street, just like we used to after working late, enjoying the quiet night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, I was fresh out of college, full of energy, mostly talking about work while Leonard listened more and spoke less, occasionally pointing out problems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than a decade had passed, and I never thought I&#39;d be walking this path again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spilled everything to Leonard about Alan&#39;s past. I hadn&#39;t planned on it, worried about Leonard&#39;s future and the danger I was in. But when he called himself my &#34;mentor,&#34; all my defenses crumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharing secrets with someone close felt like both a confession and a relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I finished Alan&#39;s story, I was in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, Leonard would recall how I cried uncontrollably that night, sobbing and speaking in fits and starts, but my expression stayed the same. It broke his heart, like a father watching his daughter in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the dead of winter, and the night was eerily quiet. Occasionally, a car would pass by, its headlights casting fleeting light on Leonard&#39;s face, and I saw his cheeks tremble slightly in the dim glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hearing the whole story, he didn&#39;t say a word. He just slowed his pace, walking more and more slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remarkable.&#34; That was the first word he said after a long silence, followed by an apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I should have talked to you properly that night. I also got news about the trial that night. I thought the case would be resolved, but... I think you cried when you left the police station and then met Joseph.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard said, &#34;He was guiding you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard stopped under a streetlamp, looking up at the light, his eyes flickering, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, he said, &#34;Your dad called me a few days ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was surprised. Why would my dad call Leonard? They&#39;d only met a few times and exchanged contact info. He should have known about my resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it hit me. It had been about a month since Alan&#39;s incident. I hadn&#39;t gone home, only called my dad a few times with excuses. Worried about me, my dad couldn&#39;t reach anyone else and had to call Leonard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;I really don&#39;t know how to tell my dad about this, so I have to keep it from him for now. If I go home now, I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t be able to hide it from him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Parents know their daughters best.&#34; Leonard sighed and continued, &#34;Is it cold at home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied, &#34;No, the heating&#39;s on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you pay the heating bill?&#34; Leonard asked, slightly surprised, his eyes brightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, &#34;No, my dad did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Alan&#39;s incident, I hadn&#39;t thought about these things. When the heating started, I remembered my dad urging me to pay the bill, so he probably paid it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard&#39;s expression was strange. He looked at me and smiled slightly, &#34;Your dad asked me how you&#39;ve been lately and if you&#39;ve contacted me. He was very concerned about you, especially mentioning how cold it gets in Silverlight City in winter and wondering if you paid the heating bill. He searched for the old house&#39;s heating card but couldn&#39;t find it and didn&#39;t know the heating number, so he couldn&#39;t pay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did that mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard smiled at me, his eyes glistening with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only three people knew the heating payment number for my house: me, my dad, and Alan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t me, and it wasn&#39;t my dad, so it had to be Alan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night Alan had the accident, Silverlight City hadn&#39;t started notifying about the heating payment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for that hasty autopsy report...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did Lally, Tony, Tom, and the others show no sadness when mentioning Alan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why didn&#39;t Frank mention Alan during our second meeting?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this guess was true, all previous doubts were resolved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is... is... is it true?&#34; Tears streamed down my face as I looked up at Leonard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down... I hope the guess is correct.&#34; Leonard first smiled slightly, then laughed heartily. It was the first time I had seen him so happy.</p>
