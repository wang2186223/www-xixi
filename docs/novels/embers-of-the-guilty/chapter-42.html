                <p>&#34;Mr. Williams!&#34; Benjamin shot up from his chair and gave a salute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Mr. Wright, I&#39;m not your boss. Knock it off. Back in college, you were always stirring up trouble, chasing girls, and making a scene. You think I didn&#39;t know?&#34; Leonard chuckled, waving his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin&#39;s face blushed when Leonard brought up his past. He forced a smile and said, &#34;But I did alright, didn&#39;t I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard nodded and turned to Zoey, &#34;You little rascal, you told me you didn&#39;t know him. I heard you&#39;re Nancy&#39;s apprentice. So, what do you think? Interested in joining the prosecutor&#39;s office? I can stick around for a few more years and show you the ropes. How about it? Give it some thought?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey stuck out her tongue, poured Leonard a glass of water, and grinned at me, &#34;I&#39;m used to my freedom. The prosecutor&#39;s office is too stifling for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;&#39;Like master, like apprentice&#39; indeed. Sadly, I&#39;ve only had one apprentice, and she left as soon as she learned enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard laughed heartily, but there was a hint of sadness in his eyes. He sighed and looked at me lying in the hospital bed, &#34;How are you feeling? Any better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing serious,&#34; I said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, I wasn&#39;t surprised Benjamin called Leonard, but I was shocked he came in person. Leonard was known for being stubborn and cherishing his reputation. He avoided social engagements and anything that might harm his image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So his visit was a big surprise, even though he had mentored me. When I got married, I sent him an invitation, but he didn&#39;t come. He sent a congratulatory message instead, which was already a pleasant surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent. Zoey stuck out her tongue and found an excuse to step out and take a call. Benjamin ate his breakfast, glancing between me and Leonard, wondering if he should offer Leonard a bite, but decided against it when he saw the bite marks on the sandwich.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t bring anything,&#34; Leonard said, looking at the fruit and flowers on the table with an awkward smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No worries, just bring something next time,&#34; I said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin, munching on his sandwich, widened his eyes in shock at my words. Silverlight City was the capital of West Sand State, and the deputy chief prosecutor of the Silverlight City Prosecutor&#39;s Office is undoubtedly a big shot. He was shocked that I would speak to Leonard like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True,&#34; Leonard nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin was even more unsettled, his eyes nearly popping out. Was this the same deputy chief prosecutor known for his fairness and strictness? He seemed more like a concerned mentor at a bedside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take care of yourself. You&#39;re still young. What if you end up with a chronic condition?&#34; Leonard sighed, looking at me. He opened his mouth as if to say something more but finally said, &#34;I should have come sooner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was his apology. He hadn&#39;t come to my wedding, and after Alan&#39;s incident, I was the one who called him. It wasn&#39;t until I collapsed from exhaustion and emotional stress that he came. This was the bond between mentor and apprentice, and we both remembered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, a corruption case involved many people from the city government, including the Forestry Bureau. They tried to pin the blame on Alan, an innocent clerk. Although he was eventually cleared, he still received a reprimand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard knew Alan was innocent but still went along with the Forestry Bureau&#39;s reprimand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That incident was the final straw for me at the prosecutor&#39;s office. Alan was a big reason, but I also couldn&#39;t stand the injustice. Even if it had been someone else, I would have opposed Leonard&#39;s decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Justice and fairness were the bare minimum; we couldn&#39;t just let things slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now Alan was gone, and after leaving the prosecutor&#39;s office, I found out Leonard wasn&#39;t the one calling the shots. He was under a lot of pressure too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus, after the True Love Entertainment Club murder case trial, he broke his principles for the first time and gave me the case files. With those files, I started to confirm my suspicions and began my investigation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That incident... wasn&#39;t your fault.&#34; I looked up at my former boss and mentor, Leonard, and gave a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s the court handling things now? Any new evidence? When will Alan&#39;s case go to trial? No pressure, but if it&#39;s convenient, could you fill me in?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This case is getting weirder,&#34; Leonard adjusted his glasses and glanced at Benjamin, &#34;Mr. Wright, there must be something unusual going on at the police department too, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin replied seriously, &#34;Yeah, all the personnel investigating Alan&#39;s case have been sent to southern cities for training and exchange programs. They won&#39;t be back for a while, and even I have to go on a business trip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard glanced at Benjamin and shook his head, &#34;You&#39;re great at handling cases, but you lose your cool when things get tough. I bet after Nancy talked to you, you ran to the police department that very night to check things out, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin laughed awkwardly and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, even the prosecutor&#39;s office is acting strange?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, ever since the last adjournment, the court has paused all work on this case,&#34; Leonard said, looking serious and thoughtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Stephen?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stephen was the judge in charge of criminal cases at the Silverlight City court. He was known for his diligence and fairness. With such a flimsy evidence chain and case details, he couldn&#39;t possibly stay silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s in an even worse situation than Benjamin. He was directly transferred to another city&#39;s court. Several other judges were also sent on business trips, and the prosecutors handling this case were reassigned or sent on trips right after the trial.&#34; Leonard took a sip of water from his cup and continued, &#34;I only recently realized why they made me the notary. The prosecutor responsible for the case evidence had already been reassigned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed this case had been complicated from the start. In less than half a month, all personnel from the police, prosecutor&#39;s office, and court involved in the True Love Entertainment Club murder case had been removed, causing the case to stall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it Laura&#39;s influence? Are they planning to bail her out next?&#34; Benjamin found the situation increasingly bizarre.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laura is just a theater actress. She doesn&#39;t have the power to mobilize the state court, prosecutor&#39;s office, and police department simultaneously. Besides, it would be too obvious.&#34; Leonard paused, then added, &#34;What&#39;s strange is that despite the long delay and questionable evidence, Laura&#39;s bail application was denied.&#34;</p>
