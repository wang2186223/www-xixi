                <p>Yesterday, I went back home to visit my dad and stayed the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea that Alan might still be alive was just a hunch for now; the key was to see what evidence Joseph had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking back, it definitely wasn&#39;t a coincidence that I ran into Joseph after leaving the police station. He wasn&#39;t just there to drop a few hints.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was both a decoy, making me think Alan went to True Love Entertainment Club alone, and a guide, pushing me to dig deeper, making me question Alan&#39;s motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This way, I stayed somewhat rational during the trial instead of being consumed by grief over losing my husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s actions seemed a bit scattered, but if we considered him as one of the victimized kids from back then, it started to make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might be like Tony and Lally, wanting to tell me something. Actually, it seemed like he wanted to tell me something from the start but held back for some reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at it this way, it seemed like he was on Frank&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then again, everyone involved in the True Love Entertainment Club arson and murder case had been transferred, except for him. Could he have been overlooked by the leadership?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way. The forensic doctor was the most direct evidence person. If he stayed, there had to be a reason. The most likely reason was that he had a direct connection with the people protecting the main culprits of the child trafficking ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, he might be deeply connected to this case itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But these details weren&#39;t important right now. Since he hadn&#39;t left Silverlight City, it meant he was confident, and I didn&#39;t need to rush to find him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The most important thing right now was that my dad called again the night before last, saying I hadn&#39;t been home in a while and asked if I had a fight with Alan and was too embarrassed to see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went along with it and said we had a fight over some small stuff, and Alan went on a business trip and hadn&#39;t come back yet. The next morning, I quickly bought some things, drove home, and spent the day with my dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dad asked why Alan wasn&#39;t answering his phone, which really startled me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been almost two months since the incident. Although Alan and my dad didn&#39;t usually talk much, the truth couldn&#39;t be hidden forever. If my dad noticed something, it would be impossible to hide it from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly said that this business trip was a fully enclosed core training, and information couldn&#39;t be disclosed. I couldn&#39;t contact him either, let alone him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dad finally broke into a smile, adding more food to my plate. &#34;My son-in-law is naturally successful, unlike some people who give up a good job at the prosecutor&#39;s office to become an editor-in-chief at a newspaper. Is that job stable? If the company goes under, they&#39;ll be unemployed again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, I couldn&#39;t afford to discuss career choices with my dad, so I just nodded repeatedly in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This morning, I got up early, made breakfast for my dad, washed all the clothes at home, and cleaned the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Zoey called. I found an excuse, saying there was something at the company, didn&#39;t even have lunch, and hurriedly left home, driving back to the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey called to check on me, saying there was a lot going on at the company lately, and Howard had dumped a bunch of tasks on her that she couldn&#39;t refuse, making her work overtime every night. It was clear he was trying to keep her from getting involved in the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed like Howard was also trying to keep Zoey from getting too involved. Even though he wasn&#39;t her dad, their bond was pretty much like father and daughter. I got it, and honestly, I didn&#39;t want Zoey mixed up in this mess either-it was way too dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t just come out and say that, so I gently reassured her, filling her in on the latest. I told her we found the child trafficking camp at the old steel factory, which is now the True Love Entertainment Club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oddly, Zoey didn&#39;t seem too thrilled. She gave a weird response, then said she had plans to have dinner with her dad and would catch up with me later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t spend much time with her dad growing up; Howard mostly raised her. It was good they were working on their relationship now, so I gave her some advice before hanging up. She cheerfully agreed and then we ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked the time-it was 9:30 in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, the court was already in session. I thought for a moment, found Joseph&#39;s name in my contacts, which I got from his file the night before last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What should I say when I call? Would he spill the truth?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he, like Tony and Lally, had second thoughts about revenge, then maybe calling him was worth a shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what if he didn&#39;t? What if what he said the night Alan had the accident was just to cover for the two people who went to the Entertainment Club with Alan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, my phone rang. It was Leonard. &#34;Nancy, are you back from your dad&#39;s place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied, &#34;Yeah, I just got back. I&#39;m on the road now, planning to head to the court.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard knew about my visit to my dad. He also said that since we had a lead, there was no rush to find Joseph. We needed to be patient and make sure my dad didn&#39;t get suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t go there, you won&#39;t be able to meet him,&#34; Leonard said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was confused. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joseph&#39;s been taken in for investigation. They say it&#39;s for lifestyle issues. He probably won&#39;t be out today,&#34; Leonard&#39;s voice sounded a bit off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lifestyle issues?&#34; I repeated, thinking of Joseph as a pretty straightforward guy. Even when we met that night, despite him putting on some weight in middle age, he didn&#39;t seem like someone with lifestyle issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus, he was just a forensic doctor, not some big shot. Why would they target him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard was vague, not giving specifics, just telling me to ask the folks at Silverlight City Legal Journal. And Howard probably knew about it already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was puzzled and dialed Howard&#39;s number. &#34;Howard, are you busy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m listening to some juicy gossip! The court&#39;s got some real characters. I didn&#39;t expect this, someone so young already making waves,&#34; Howard said eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was speechless for a moment. Leonard was right-my boss might be mediocre in the news business, but when it came to gossip in Silverlight City, he was always in the know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked, &#34;Joseph?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard replied, &#34;Nancy, you into gossip now? No, you don&#39;t seem the type. What&#39;s up, how do you know about Joseph?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard got serious, &#34;Could he be connected to that case too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;Tell me about the lifestyle issue first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, that,&#34; Howard teased, &#34;First time in Silverlight City, a male forensic doctor having a sexual relationship with a certain leader. The video got posted online, and it was wild!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Focus,&#34; I reminded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That leader is also a man,&#34; Howard replied.</p>
