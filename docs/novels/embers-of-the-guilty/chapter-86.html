                <p>&#34;What did he say?&#34; My heart was racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anyone knew if Alan was really dead, it would be the coroner. The body was so badly burned that DNA testing was tough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a mess at the time. A DNA test that complicated would need multiple comparisons, and without Alan&#39;s DNA, how could they figure it out overnight just from a ring?</p>

                <p>I kept repeating &#34;It&#39;s not him&#34; in my head. My cheeks were hot, and tears were already streaming down my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t him. That body wasn&#39;t Alan. He was still alive!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is he?&#34; I stammered, looking at Evelyn through my tears. &#34;Where is he? Please, tell me where he is...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn looked scared and confused. She shook her head and started crying too. &#34;I don&#39;t know. Joseph only told me those two things before they took him away. Ms. Johnson, who are you? Please save Joseph. He&#39;s innocent... He couldn&#39;t have any lifestyle issues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn&#39;s sobs got louder. &#34;I just can&#39;t believe it. His life has been hard enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;I&#39;m Alan&#39;s wife. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll find a way to get him out. I have so many questions for him. Don&#39;t cry. As long as he&#39;s alive, there&#39;s hope. Life is long, and things will get better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wiped my tears and walked over to gently pat Evelyn, who was crying uncontrollably on the table. &#34;I&#39;m Joseph&#39;s senior. I promise you, I&#39;ll bring him back safe and sound.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I turned and left the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second thing Joseph told me was Ronald Food Truck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered. The first time I went to True Love Entertainment Club to investigate, around 1 PM, a guy set up a stall called &#34;Ronald Food Truck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald... Why did that name sound so familiar?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s dad! If that was true, I remembered the second time I went to True Love Entertainment Club, Benjamin stared at the food truck owner for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager even asked if the guy was a criminal. Benjamin said he looked like someone from his village and that they should take good care of his business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He definitely recognized him. Benjamin was from Silverlight City; there was no way he had a village buddy here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus, when we were waiting downstairs that day, Zoey&#39;s expression was off. She must have recognized her dad then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found it weird that day too, but after going upstairs and seeing the injured Lally, and then diving into Alan&#39;s case, I forgot about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was it. No wonder Zoey knew about this case. Her dad Ronald must have spilled the beans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, Howard was furious today, slamming the table, and the scene was chaotic. Then he told me about Evelyn and forgot to ask about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Digging into this case was risky, but Zoey was still fine in the office. Howard could just call to remind her; there shouldn&#39;t be such a big emotional reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard said he helped me because of the shared pain of losing a spouse, our years of friendship, and my contributions to the company. But now it seemed it wasn&#39;t that simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reaction was way too intense. There was only one reason: he knew Ronald was digging into True Love Entertainment Club. He might even know the dangers lurking there and what went down in the past!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why didn&#39;t he tell me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the time. It was 4 PM. Ronald might still be at that stall!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way, I called Howard directly and asked, &#34;Howard, are you hiding something from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, what would I hide from you? Last time, I asked you to register as a company partner and put the documents in front of you, but you didn&#39;t want to sign.&#34; He replied decisively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Howard&#39;s tone, it didn&#39;t sound like he was lying, but I kept pushing, &#34;Is Ronald investigating True Love Entertainment Club? Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was silence on the other end of the line. After a while, he replied, &#34;Joseph is also one of the kids from the old steel mill, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know about the old steel mill, you really have been hiding something from me.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t told Howard about this, and why did he use the word &#34;also&#34;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither of us should complain. You never mentioned Alan&#39;s past either. Every time you came to me, it was to ask about people. I&#39;m not a fool; I naturally investigated. I know some of the names of the kids from the old steel mill, so I could guess Alan&#39;s past.&#34; Howard said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was because...&#34; I hesitated. Alan&#39;s past was too tragic. I really didn&#39;t want to bring it up in front of others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, this case was inherently dangerous. I was very worried that they would get too involved and bring disaster upon themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand.&#34; Howard sighed on the phone. &#34;Entangled grievances, a troubled fate, who would want to bring it up? You wouldn&#39;t even want to dream about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much do you know? Tell me.&#34; I got straight to the point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not much. Ronald is very tight-lipped. I only know about the old steel mill and some of the names.&#34; Howard replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Including Frank?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, he didn&#39;t tell me, but I know. That&#39;s one of the reasons we get along well. This person has a very strong will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard said frankly, then hesitated and asked, &#34;Nancy, there&#39;s something you might get very angry about, but...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you&#39;re going to say it anyway, right? At this point... if you think it&#39;s unnecessary to say, then don&#39;t.&#34; I could vaguely guess what he was going to say, so I interrupted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop investigating. I know it&#39;s cruel, but listen to me. Ronald was demoted to an ordinary police officer years ago because of his investigation into the old steel mill case. This man is very stubborn. He said he had been pursuing this case for over twenty years and couldn&#39;t just stop. And the result?&#34; Howard sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do admire him.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a law enforcement officer, the pursuit of justice and truth was a lifelong mission. Zoey&#39;s father was a good cop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was shot three times, each time nearly losing his life. If I hadn&#39;t found a military doctor, this bastard would be dead. It doesn&#39;t matter if he dies, but what about Zoey? Nancy, Alan is gone. I know you&#39;re in pain, but... even if you wait a little longer, being alive is more important than anything.&#34; Howard said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alan is still alive. I have to find him. This case must be solved.&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I hung up the phone.</p>
