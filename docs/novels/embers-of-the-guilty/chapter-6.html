                <p>Last night, I booked a hotel and made do with a night outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I instinctively avoided anything that might stir up emotions and mess with my judgment, giving my stressed-out mind a chance to chill for a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, I woke up and headed back home, changing into a set of black clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The request I made to Leonard over the phone the night before was to attend the hearing as a victim&#39;s family member.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay on the couch, resting with my eyes closed. The afternoon hearing was crucial, and I needed to be fully focused on the witnesses&#39; statements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yesterday&#39;s news summary showed that the class reunion was a complete fabrication, and the materials for the forestry bureau&#39;s year-end review had been completed last month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, what was the connection between Alan&#39;s unusual behavior lately and his accident?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a nagging feeling that these pieces of information were too neat, and that the investigation was going too smoothly, but ultimately, it was just suspicion without any solid clues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky was gloomy, and the weeping willows outside the window couldn&#39;t resist the autumn wind, bowing and swaying their desolate branches as if in apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaves fell to the ground, driven by the autumn wind, like half-dead drunks, fluttering and stopping, eventually freezing to death in the winter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike the verdant willows of spring that danced in the breeze, a single leaf falling to the ground signified an end. The shared essence of life and time was marked by their relentless cruelty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time it got cloudy, I felt down. Alan often said I was a sensitive person at heart. Then I would joke that if a sentimental person were to work in law, they might be better off writing romance dramas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Above the couch, there was a collection of Emily Dickinson&#39;s poems that Alan often read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alan was a typical idealist, living a simple life with a rich spiritual world. He liked reading poetry, which I didn&#39;t understand, but I knew that poetry had little market in the country, barely surviving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The market can&#39;t explain everything. Of course, I&#39;m not contradicting you, Nancy,&#34; Alan said thoughtfully, looking up. &#34;Everyone will encounter it at a special time, either at the end of time or in the darkest moment. A line of poetry is like a lamp, reigniting their life. Of course, I hope you never understand poets or poetry. Whether a reader or a poet, they are always in pain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up the poetry collection, and one page was folded by Alan. The poem was very short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[My life closed twice before its close-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It yet remains to see</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Immortality unveil</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A third event to me,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So huge, so hopeless to conceive</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As these that twice befell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Parting is all we know of heaven,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And all we need of hell.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily was Alan&#39;s favorite poet, a woman who spent almost thirty years in seclusion, accompanied by loneliness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alan liked reading poetry. According to him, being forced into rational work dulled one&#39;s emotions. Therefore, he occasionally read poetry to me before bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had read this poem to me. Honestly, I couldn&#39;t grasp its depth. Looking back now, when Alan read this poem, he seemed to carry a deep sense of loneliness and sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what resonance he shared with this poet and wondered if there was something in his past that he was hiding from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly thought that my husband seemed to be growing more distant from me, somewhat unfamiliar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already 1:30 PM, and the hearing was at 2:30 PM. I couldn&#39;t afford to think too much. I changed into black clothes, quickly tidied up, and drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I deliberately arrived half an hour early. Instead of sitting in the audience, I stood in a corner of the courtroom, took out a pair of sunglasses from my pocket, and observed the participants, hoping to find some clues, especially from Mike, Bob, and Frank. My suspicions about them hadn&#39;t been dispelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the hearing got closer, I didn&#39;t notice anything out of the ordinary, but then I saw a familiar face-my apprentice, Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was looking around with a camera and spotted me right away. She ran over with red eyes and hugged me tight. &#34;Mrs. Smith, I don&#39;t know how to comfort you. The boss said we should give you some space and let you take it easy for a while, but I can&#39;t help it. I&#39;m really worried about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, a 22-year-old law intern from Silverlight University, was smart, had good writing skills, and solid professional knowledge, so I took her under my wing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was an only child and didn&#39;t have many friends, but somehow, Zoey and I had clicked over the past six months, and I&#39;d come to see her as a sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having dealt with the pain alone these past few days, I was really touched by her concern. I patted her shoulder and said, &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;Mrs. Smith, I want to stay with you for a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied, &#34;We&#39;ll talk about it later. Go sit down; the hearing is about to start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, I walked straight to the audience seat, and the hearing officially began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The presiding judge, associate judges, jurors, clerk, and prosecutor entered in sequence. This case was a big deal, and it was presided over by the first court of Silverlight City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jury had seven people, and the presiding judge was Stephen Jackson, a man in his forties with a stern face, known for his seriousness. He was an experienced criminal judge and a member of the judicial committee. The government was really taking this matter seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The prosecutor was my former boss from the district attorney&#39;s office, Leonard. Leonard noticed me and glanced in my direction. I thought for a moment and then greeted him with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having the deputy district attorney act as the prosecutor was rare in public prosecution cases. The prosecutor&#39;s office was also giving a lot of attention to this case. But personally, this was my husband&#39;s case, and I appreciated the gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt slightly relieved as Stephen announced the True Love Entertainment Club Arson and Murder Case was officially in session and called the defendant to the court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was my first time seeing Laura in person again after ten years of my marriage. Laura seemed a few years younger than Alan, probably in her early thirties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time hadn&#39;t left any marks on her. She looked the same as ten years ago. Her features weren&#39;t particularly delicate, but together, they exuded a natural charm, especially her eyes, filled with wildness, desire, and a hint of ruthlessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Escorted by the bailiff, she slowly walked to the defendant&#39;s seat, looking around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had seen this scene before. In the university drama club, when she took center stage as the lead actress and took her bow, she had the same expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly took off my sunglasses and met her gaze. At that moment, I no longer suppressed my emotions, like venomous tongues of fire, ready to engulf her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our gaze met briefly, yet she didn&#39;t linger, as if she had never seen me before, but the slight smile at the corner of her mouth was caught by me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought, &#39;The experiences at the police station these past few days haven&#39;t affected her at all. Is her mental strength really that strong? If she could commit such inhumane acts, what couldn&#39;t she do?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of this, a chill ran through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Stephen read out the charges and rights against Laura, Leonard began to accuse her of the arson and murder at the Entertainment Club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honorable Judge, Prosecutor.&#34; Laura held her head high, looked directly at Stephen, and said firmly, &#34;I am not guilty!&#34;</p>
