                <p>&#34;Yeah, you got it all figured out! So, what now? You gonna kill me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anna&#39;s hair was a tangled mess, and she was hysterically rolling on the floor, laughing one moment and crying the next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why...&#34; Tony slumped to the ground, defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Did I, Anna, ever have a good day after marrying you, this useless man? You two put on quite a show. I wondered why the compensation for the Sand Village demolition fight never came through. I wondered why Nancy suddenly went silent. Turns out the compensation had already been paid, and you used it to buy a huge insurance policy for your mom. You&#39;re such a dutiful son. What about me? What about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anna pounded her chest, spitting as she screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to your house, and what did you give me? Didn&#39;t I help you find your job? Wasn&#39;t it my live streaming, acting like a clown in front of the camera, that kept us afloat? What did I ever do wrong to you? And now, you&#39;re planning to die, right? Is the Entertainment Club murder case related to you? I misjudged you. I didn&#39;t expect you to be so heartless. If you die, your mom gets the money, and I continue to sell my dignity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anna added, &#34;Yes, I had thoughts, but I didn&#39;t kill her. She&#39;s lying in the hospital just fine. She never liked me since I married you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony watched quietly the hysterical Anna, his expression growing colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never imagined that the woman he had risked everything to save from that room, naked and vulnerable, would turn out like this. He had married Anna despite Tammy and Tom&#39;s objections, hoping to give her a new life. Was it all a mistake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t understand, or perhaps he didn&#39;t want to. He remembered the despair and rage he felt when he saw Lally being stripped and abused by a group of men. He had wanted to tear them apart but ended up beaten and bruised, returning home in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that moment, he swore he would never witness such a scene again, even if it cost him his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all a misalignment of fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day he went to find Lally, he saw Anna being stripped in a room. He saved her without hesitation, but it plunged his soul into an abyss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frank, in a wheelchair, slowly entered, his sickly face showing no emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lally glanced at him, a flicker of joy quickly replaced by endless sorrow and sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anna&#39;s eyes darted around, remaining silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frank&#39;s gaze lingered on Tony and Lally, not sparing Anna a glance, as if she were invisible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your task is complete.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frank&#39;s eyes finally fell on Anna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony&#39;s head snapped up, and Lally looked at Frank in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Frank, what do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frank didn&#39;t respond, just looked at Anna emotionlessly, repeating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your task is complete. Laura is out. The person who promised you money was Ronald, right? Well, he won&#39;t be able to pay you. He&#39;s going to die soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Anna crawled over to Tony, clinging to him, sobbing. &#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere. I want to stay with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony looked at Anna and Frank in disbelief, his mind blank, unable to process what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is never beneficial to immerse oneself too deeply into the role.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frank looked deeply at Anna, his words carrying an undeniable authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I beg you, I don&#39;t want the money. I just want to stay with him.&#34; Anna crawled over, clutching Frank&#39;s wheelchair, pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tony, I don&#39;t know you well, but I&#39;ve been in contact with your father over the years. I owe him a great debt. You and Tom are like brothers, even without blood ties. I understand that. And your relationship with Lally... In short, I see you as one of my own.&#34; Frank said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony stood up abruptly, eyes wide, looking at Frank in disbelief. When Frank smiled gently and nodded, tears streamed down Tony&#39;s face as he choked out. &#34;My dad... He&#39;s still alive... Where is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Thompson is still alive?&#34; Lally&#39;s spirits lifted, her surprise evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, he didn&#39;t die in that fire years ago. Ronald betrayed him and tried to kill him. When news of George&#39;s death came out, he didn&#39;t believe it. He had Douglas, the Entertainment Club owner, and Anna stage this whole act, forcing your father out. This marriage was a sham from the start.&#34; Frank said solemnly, patting Tony&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frank continued, &#34;Only I, Tom, Bob, and Mike knew about this. We didn&#39;t tell you to protect Mr. Thompson. Keeping you here was to keep you safe from Ronald. It&#39;s been tough on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lally&#39;s eyes grew colder. Frank seemed increasingly unfamiliar. His perfect words hid one person: Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Tony were captured because they wanted to tell Nancy the old steel mill&#39;s secret. Frank discovered this and intervened. How did the narrative change to Frank&#39;s self-sacrifice for their sake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hypocrite... You monsters are all the same!&#34; Anna pointed at Frank, trembling with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This world is too complex to explain in a single sentence. It&#39;s like a web, full of entanglements and grudges. Anna, you can leave now.&#34; Frank smiled faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His first message revealed Anna as Ronald&#39;s spy, stripping Tony of his trust in her. The second message revealed George was alive, implying Frank&#39;s sacrifices for the Thompson family&#39;s survival, drawing Tony to his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what Anna said now, it was futile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go, leave with some dignity.&#34; Frank said, then slowly left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anna looked at Lally and Tony, suddenly smiling with relief. She stood up, pushing Frank&#39;s wheelchair, and slowly left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anna, where are you going?&#34; Tony stood up to stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tony, the game is over.&#34; Anna smiled, turned back, and walked away.</p>
