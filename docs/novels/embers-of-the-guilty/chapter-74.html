                <p>These past few days, I haven&#39;t seen Frank or Tom around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tammy wasn&#39;t doing so well. Even though they had removed all the pesticides from her system, she remained in a coma. The doctors had no idea when she would wake up; it was entirely up to her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom brought in the best medical team he could find to take care of Tammy 24/7. I swing by the hospital every day with a fresh bouquet and change the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The medical staff told me Tom rushes in at night, sits for a bit to check on her, and then takes off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps he was avoiding me, or perhaps he was simply exceedingly busy. Regardless, it did not truly matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m visiting Tammy out of respect and compassion. When Alan was a kid, he lived in Sand Village, and Tammy and George took great care of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alan&#39;s gone, but I&#39;m still his wife, and I need to honor that kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, I haven&#39;t asked anyone for help, not even Leonard or Ruben. They&#39;ve already done so much. Leonard worked his whole life to become the Deputy District Attorney, which wasn&#39;t easy, and Ruben&#39;s career is just taking off. I can&#39;t let my problems mess with their work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard and Benjamin had been calling to check in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin persistently insisted that Cindy stay with me for a while. Cindy was one of my few friends from college, and after we graduated, we both found ourselves in the same city. We used to spend time together occasionally, but it had been over six months since we last saw each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Going to my place wasn&#39;t an option, so I picked up some of Cindy&#39;s favorite desserts from college and drove to her house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cindy and Benjamin lived in the Silverlight City development area, on the same main road as Sand Village, just a few miles away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I parked outside their community and spotted Cindy waiting at the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a while since we last met, but she still looked as beautiful as ever. She had delicate features, thin lips, silver-framed round glasses, long hair, a dark blue plaid cotton dress, and a gray cotton jacket. She looked every bit the intellectual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of her severe nearsightedness, if you met her for the first time, you&#39;d think she was aloof, but it was just because she couldn&#39;t see clearly and seemed a bit distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calling her an intellectual wasn&#39;t wrong; she was super smart. She was four years younger than us in college.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not only my college roommate but also in the same major as me. After getting her bachelor&#39;s degree, she went on to get a master&#39;s in modern and contemporary literature, and then a Ph.D.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though they got married early, Cindy&#39;s studies delayed having kids until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Considering we hadn&#39;t seen each other for over half a year, her face had gotten rounder, her body a bit plumper, and her belly slightly bulging. Wait, she was pregnant!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cindy came over and hugged me, whispering, &#34;Nancy, I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t be there for you right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m the one who should apologize. Benjamin should be with you now, but because of my situation, he had to go out of town,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I realized Cindy had probably been waiting outside for a while in the cold winter. I took her hand and started walking towards her house, saying, &#34;You didn&#39;t even tell me you were pregnant. What if you catch a cold in this weather?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay, my mom&#39;s been staying with me lately. I bundled up before coming out, see?&#34; Cindy patted her thick cotton jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had met Cindy&#39;s mom, Jody Rivera, back in college, and I always called her &#34;Ms. Rivera&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been years since I last saw her. Time hadn&#39;t been kind; she used to dress so fashionably, but now her hair had more white strands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was still warm and kind, holding my hand as we sat on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said Cindy often talked about me and that we should keep in touch more. Cindy wasn&#39;t very social, and I was her only friend. We should go out and have fun together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cindy and I were both in our thirties, but in her mom&#39;s eyes, we were still kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t forget to complain about Benjamin, saying his company leaders were too inconsiderate, sending him out of town for training and meetings while his wife was pregnant, and he hadn&#39;t returned for so long. Was Benjamin the only police officer in Silverlight City? Did he have to do everything? They might as well make him the chief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a pang of guilt. It seemed Cindy&#39;s mom didn&#39;t know Benjamin was sent away because of my situation. Maybe Cindy and Benjamin hadn&#39;t told her about Alan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jody suddenly asked, &#34;By the way, Nancy, how&#39;s Alan doing lately? He&#39;s such a good kid. When you were in college, I knew from the first glance that you two would get married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, is there still meat and vegetables in the fridge? Nancy will have dinner at our place tonight.&#34; Cindy chided Jody and pulled her up, &#34;Go, I&#39;ll talk with Nancy in my room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled me into the study and closed the door. &#34;Nancy, how&#39;s the investigation going? Any clues about Alan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, there are some leads. I&#39;ve sorted out the most crucial information, but I don&#39;t know where to start.&#34; I smiled bitterly. I could have gotten information from Lally and Tony, but they were now missing. Ruben had no leads, and Frank and Tom refused to tell me anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the only possible source, Tammy, was in a coma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of force was behind these people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What clues? Tell me, maybe I can help!&#34; Cindy said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fewer people involved in this matter, the better. I hadn&#39;t let Zoey help these past few days, let alone Cindy, who was pregnant. I&#39;ve already troubled Benjamin enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nancy, are you treating me as an outsider too?&#34; Seeing my hesitation, Cindy got anxious, frowning, her eyes red, &#34;Benjamin told me about Alan&#39;s accident. I messaged you, saying I&#39;d come to stay with you for a couple of days, but you said you were fine. I asked you about it, but you didn&#39;t say anything. Do you not consider me a good friend anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This matter is too complicated and dangerous. Benjamin was temporarily sent away because he interfered with the case. If you get involved, how can I face you two?&#34; I said guiltily, gently touching Cindy&#39;s belly, &#34;You should focus on taking care of your baby now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hugged me and whispered, &#34;Let me help you, please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about it. The place Alan stayed should be not far from Sand Village, but I couldn&#39;t find the original location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cindy lived nearby, and although she moved in later, this area used to be a village. Maybe she knew something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, &#34;Let me be clear, you can&#39;t get involved in this matter. I&#39;m just asking for information.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her nod and promise, I asked, &#34;Was there a place in Sand Village twenty years ago where children often played?&#34;</p>
