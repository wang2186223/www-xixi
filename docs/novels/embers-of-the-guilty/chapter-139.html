                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing much. Frank&#39;s not here, so what&#39;s the big deal? Why can&#39;t we talk about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom stared at the ground, silent for a long time. After much thought, he looked up and said, &#34;A bit of both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People were complicated, especially those like them, entangled by hatred, fate, and mission. They never seemed to have the chance to ponder such philosophical questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Frank was like a mentor to Tom, and even though Tom sometimes wondered if Frank was being too extreme, the day they set sail, their fates were tightly bound together. This ship could only move forward, with no room for hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise, it would mean certain death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re quite fair. How are Lally and Tony doing? And what about Anna, your sister-in-law?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph sighed, not pressing further, and asked about the others. When he mentioned Anna, a hint of amusement crossed his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Frank, Joseph, and Tom all saw it clearly. It was a setup orchestrated by Ronald, with Laura directing her gold-digging pawn to test the waters at the Thompson House, to see if George was really dead. First, they tested Tom, but Tom was too smart to fall for it. His brother Tony, however, was a different story. Tony, the hopeless romantic, was determined to be with Anna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re all doing well, including... including Anna,&#34; Tom said flatly. Suddenly, he remembered something, his eyes darkened, and he spoke softly, &#34;I heard a couple of days ago that Duke had a drug relapse in prison, his heart stopped, and they couldn&#39;t save him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duke, dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you have anything to do with it?&#34; Joseph turned sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony had deep feelings for Lally, but he kept them hidden. Even after getting married, those feelings remained buried. Tom despised Duke, believing Lally and Tony were meant to be together. Ever since Douglas got Duke hooked on drugs, Tom had ignored Duke. Now, Duke had just been imprisoned for multiple charges, including rape and assault, and suddenly he was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom&#39;s expression grew serious as he met Joseph&#39;s gaze and slowly shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed true...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We agreed from the start, revenge is one thing, but we don&#39;t involve our own. Tony and Lally just wanted to tell Nancy the truth about what happened. What&#39;s wrong with that? Does Frank&#39;s grand plan to defy fate and the gods mean everyone has to die with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s just a businessman, a CEO of a Fortune 500 company. How dare he go up against someone who is about to become the state police chief? Doesn&#39;t he realize that by doing this, he&#39;s no different from Ronald? Does he remember our vow for freedom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s voice grew louder, but as his face twisted with anger, his voice grew softer, as if something was stuck in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you? The night Douglas died, you were sent to the police morgue by Ronald. Why did you hint to Nancy on your way back? Why involve her in this? Didn&#39;t you betray our promise?&#34; Tom lunged at Joseph, grabbing his collar, his voice filled with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he noticed Joseph&#39;s body slowly collapsing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom realized something was wrong and quickly moved his hands from Joseph&#39;s collar to his waist, trying to support him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joseph! What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom frantically searched for wounds, especially around the neck, arteries, and heart, but found nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood was already trickling from Joseph&#39;s mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it, I treat you all the same. These cigarettes... all at once...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom remembered when they were kids at the old steel mill, whenever he, Frank, and Alan argued, it was always Joseph, a few years younger, who played peacemaker. He would carefully break a cookie into four pieces and hand them out, smiling and saying, &#34;We&#39;re best friends for life. Best friends don&#39;t fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tear fell from Tom&#39;s eye, while blood trickled from his prosthetic eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was investigated because Frank reported me... to take down Ronald. I... I don&#39;t blame him, but he... he didn&#39;t know. Before I went in, I had Evelyn tell Nancy that Alan is still alive. She must understand by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s face was pale, a triumphant smile on his blood-stained lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw Ronald before I got out. If I didn&#39;t take the poison, I wouldn&#39;t have made it out to see you... He&#39;s still in Silverlight City.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom picked up Joseph and placed him in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going to the hospital. Don&#39;t talk, stay awake, stay alive! Listen, Joseph! You can&#39;t die!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those familiar words, Joseph closed his eyes, remembering someone saying the same thing to him over twenty years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Maybach roared to life, speeding towards the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snow began to fall, and Joseph, leaning against the window, watched the snowy landscape, recalling his first day at the old steel mill. It had snowed that day too, and a child inside had pressed his face against the glass, watching him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first to greet him was Tom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph murmured weakly, &#34;Tom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t talk! Save your strength!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph added, &#34;I mean... meeting you guys at the old steel mill wasn&#39;t so bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom, with tears in his voice, ignored the traffic lights, flooring the gas pedal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t go to the hospital. Take me home. While I still have breath, I want to see Evelyn one last time. I called her when I got out. She&#39;s waiting at the gate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s vision blurred, but he felt the car make a sharp turn, and through the haze, he saw the road sign pointing home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled weakly and whispered, &#34;Frank has changed. Don&#39;t trust him so much. I suspect Tony&#39;s disability is connected to Laura, and Frank must know about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car hesitated for a moment, then resumed its previous speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it!&#34; Tom replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the Maybach, police sirens wailed, patrol cars in pursuit. They had run several red lights, nearly causing accidents. Three police cars were now tailing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car didn&#39;t slow down, like two condemned men chasing freedom, running towards love and light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ahead, a plainly dressed woman waited in the snowstorm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car screeched to a halt, followed by the sound of brakes and the continued wail of police sirens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom carried Joseph to Evelyn, gently laying him down. Evelyn cradled Joseph in her arms, unable to hold back her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The snow fell harder, the wind blew stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn and Joseph lay on the ground, Tom sitting before Joseph, his lips trembling, eyes filled with tears, unable to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joseph, we&#39;re home,&#34; Evelyn whispered, caressing Joseph&#39;s face tenderly, as if they were lying in bed on their wedding night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph nodded weakly, struggling to open his eyes, his mouth moving with effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you regret it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn shook her head vigorously, tears falling on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph said, &#34;I&#39;m not a complete man; I&#39;m infertile. What will you do alone in this world...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I can&#39;t bear to leave you to die alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn&#39;s eyes were red as she looked at the approaching police officers, her face twisted with hatred. The officers, sensing something was wrong, kept their distance, the sirens now silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s eyes filled with fear, but his body was too weak to move. He mustered all his strength to squeeze Evelyn&#39;s hand and shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t...&#34; Before Joseph could say more, his eyes slowly closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn held him tightly, not letting go for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long time, Evelyn&#39;s hair was covered in snow. Tom, unable to bear it, gently patted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the snow, a heart-wrenching scream erupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the police station, Tom sat in the interrogation room, his eyes vacant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officer across from him had finished the paperwork and understood the situation. He spoke softly, &#34;Given the circumstances, it&#39;s understandable, but legally, it&#39;s not. Your license is revoked, and you can&#39;t reapply for three years. There&#39;s also a $1,000 fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom nodded numbly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The deceased... who was he?&#34; The officer asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was a real man!&#34; Tom&#39;s voice was strong and resolute.</p>
