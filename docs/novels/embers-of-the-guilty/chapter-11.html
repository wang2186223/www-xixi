                <p>Looking back, it was Leonard, the current Deputy Chief Prosecutor and my old boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We hadn&#39;t seen each other in three years. He looked rough, with bags under his eyes and skin like old tree bark. A few years ago, he had just a few gray hairs at his temples, but now they were completely gray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I remember right, he was only fifty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time was a killer for women and a curse for men. Women aged slowly, but men seemed to age all at once. After forty, time became a vengeful ghost, tearing at them, eager to strip them to the bone. This was the price of ambition and power; now time wanted its payback, with interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a bit sorry for him and forgot our past issues for a moment. &#34;Leonard,&#34; I called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard nodded, still stern, and slowly walked down the steps. When he looked at me, there was a flicker of the old him in his eyes. He hesitated, his dry lips moved like he wanted to say something, but it turned into a sigh, &#34;Nancy, my condolences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his expression, my heart sank. After the long trial and intense focus, I was exhausted, and the sadness started to creep back in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, during the office dispute, I hated the bureaucracy, the ruthlessness of my colleagues, and especially Leonard&#39;s actions. Three years ago, I told him in his office that he had betrayed the prosecutor&#39;s oath and turned into a power-hungry politician.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alan supported my decision but sighed, saying Leonard had his struggles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard had mentored me. I remembered his proud look when I was commended by the state prosecutor&#39;s office, and his anger and disappointment when I left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This world was tough on idealists. With Alan gone and Leonard aging, I felt a deep sadness, realizing everyone just wanted to get by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, we both fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a problem with the witnesses?&#34; Leonard got straight to the point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, something feels off, but I can&#39;t put my finger on it. I want to investigate. I don&#39;t just want the killer caught; I want to know why Alan was killed. Besides, Laura might not be...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That you can still be like this after what happened to Alan shows I wasn&#39;t wrong about you.&#34; Leonard sighed, pulled out a stack of photocopies from his bag, and handed them over. &#34;Just this once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was stunned. The victim&#39;s family wasn&#39;t supposed to see the case files without going through the proper channels. What Leonard did was definitely illegal, which was unlike him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scott is slick, but he&#39;s top-notch nationwide. What he said in court makes sense. This case needs quick, accurate, and ruthless handling, but the state court is pushing too hard. I was only notified this morning to be the prosecutor.&#34; Leonard paused, seemed to think of something, but held back, in his usual mature and steady way. Then he said in a deep voice, &#34;Don&#39;t overthink it. If you want to investigate, go ahead, but let me be clear: you can&#39;t act in the name of the prosecutor&#39;s office, and don&#39;t be impulsive. You&#39;ve got guts!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes reddened, and just as I was about to speak, Leonard waved his hand, walked down the steps, stopped after a few steps, and said slowly without looking back, &#34;If you have any difficulties, let me know. And if you want to come back... we&#39;ll talk about it later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got back to the car and started going through the case file. Most of the stuff had already come up in court, but there were four big red flags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, the autopsy report was super vague, just a few sentences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Second, the club&#39;s surveillance footage had issues recently, and the video was incomplete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Third, the list of injured people was missing some names. They could be folks who were actually there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fourth, there was no list of guests on the fourth floor of the hotel that day, which should be managed by the Entertainment Club&#39;s manager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This case file was a mess, full of holes, and missing key info. While the speed of handling the case had been commendable, the efficiency was regrettably poor, unlike the thoroughness seen in previous &#34;special cases.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked like someone wanted to wrap this up fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Leonard&#39;s expression earlier, he probably noticed this too. Investigating the higher-ups was out of my league for now, so I&#39;d need to ask him later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to start from the bottom. It seemed like these three witnesses had issues, and there was also the manager who hadn&#39;t shown up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to figure out if Alan and Laura&#39;s meeting was planned or just a coincidence, and if the other three had really not been in touch recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to dig into both sides at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, my phone rang. It was my boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked, &#34;Nancy, Frank&#39;s secretary just contacted me. It&#39;s about an investment project. We need to meet Frank tomorrow at noon. You in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied, &#34;Yeah, what time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;11 o&#39;clock, VIP Table 3 at Darben Coffee. I&#39;ve made the reservation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I talked to Frank&#39;s secretary yesterday, she said he was out of town for a meeting. How did he get back so fast?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to check out Alan&#39;s three friends first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day at 10:30, I headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was some traffic, so I texted my boss that I might be a bit late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got to the coffee shop, I was already about 10 minutes late. From a distance, I saw my boss stand up and wave at me, so I hurried over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man was sitting across from my boss, must be Frank. The info I found said he was a manager at a foreign company. I expected him to be like the court witness Tom, in a branded suit and gold-rimmed glasses, looking all successful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Frank was in sportswear, looking pretty plain. When he saw me, he slowly stood up, looking sad and worn out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nancy, Alan...&#34; Frank said, his voice trembling, almost sobbing. I noticed he didn&#39;t look well, his face pale and sickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied, &#34;Yeah, he passed away the night before last.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frank covered his mouth, one hand shaking as he held onto the chair, sobbing softly. In his thirties, in his prime, he looked like an old man about to collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him so heartbroken made me feel even worse. Even though we hadn&#39;t seen each other in ten years, I felt a bit closer to him and quickly went over to help him sit down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I turned, I glanced at my boss, casting an inquiring look to ask if he had conveyed the news of Alan&#39;s murder. My boss shook his head slightly, indicating he hadn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Currently, the authorities had not disclosed any information about the victim of this case, and even the entertainment media had not reported on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So how did Frank know?</p>
