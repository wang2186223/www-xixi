                <p>The courtroom was packed, but most folks had no clue about the gruesome details of the case. Our paper only got the photos thanks to the boss&#39;s connections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real draw? Laura. She was the city&#39;s youngest theater star, and every show she did was a sellout. She even started her own talent agency. Gossip about her was always hot, keeping the media buzzing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People loved to see someone successful fall from grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one gave a damn about Alan&#39;s death. To the public, an unknown person&#39;s suffering was just another news headline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t shake my discomfort with this era of over-the-top entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Laura claimed she was innocent, the place went nuts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two reporters next to me snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at her. She still thinks she&#39;s on stage!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, she can&#39;t kick her stage addiction. Is she gonna quote that line from Land of Ice next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am the king of the people, the laws, the nations. I will break the shackles of fate, dance before the gods, and no one can judge me. I will crown myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, a crown&#39;s out, but handcuffs fit just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Order!&#34; A stern voice cut through the noise. Stephen said seriously, &#34;The defendant will continue with her self-defense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed the chaos didn&#39;t faze Laura at all. She seemed to enjoy it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In past murder cases, suspects were either out of their minds or totally out of it in court. But Laura was different. She was mentally sharp and eager to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she have a histrionic personality?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Psychologically, she had to be tough to commit such a brutal crime and still be so composed after days of questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t add up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the relationships among the five college friends and Alan&#39;s recent odd behavior, Laura&#39;s claim of innocence made some sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura scanned the room, still smiling. &#34;You all came to see me fall, to witness the tragic end of a theater artist, but I won&#39;t give you that satisfaction. What you see might not be real. People love lies. If you&#39;re too weak, you&#39;ll be controlled by fate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, then continued, &#34;Ladies and gentlemen, Alan was my soulmate, the best playwright, a poet who understood me, and the one who introduced me to acting. He was the perfect man in my life. Why would I kill him so brutally? I&#39;ve fought against fate and the world, but I&#39;ve always had a special tenderness for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she said, &#34;My statement is over. From now on, my defense attorney will handle the details of this case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Laura bowed deeply to the crowd, like it was the end of a grand performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard and Stephen frowned, clearly unhappy with her statement. It was a mockery of the court&#39;s solemnity and irresponsible to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a prosecutor, I&#39;d been in court many times, but I&#39;d never seen a suspect act like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura wasn&#39;t just crazy. She always spoke in such an over-the-top way, like she was performing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered my wedding with Alan back in 2014. Laura was all over the place, toasting everyone like she was the host. She drank several guys under the table and then jumped on stage to belt out an impromptu aria from The Magic Flute, The Queen of the Night&#39;s Aria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about it now, it all came back to me. During the guest blessing segment, she was different from everyone else. She said, &#34;People favored by fate have such beautiful smiles. If you aren&#39;t good to Alan, I&#39;ll kill you. I&#39;m very good at this. Oh no, I&#39;m just kidding. Don&#39;t get so excited.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember her eyes so clearly. It was like she had control over everything, and there was this weird hint of malice when her eyes slightly drooped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope it&#39;s just a joke; otherwise, I won&#39;t hesitate to take on the role of prosecutor.&#34; I smiled and met her gaze directly. At my wedding, hearing such words, I had to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Interesting. Mrs. Smith, we will not meet again.&#34; She said and walked away without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words from the wedding ten years ago turned out to be a prophecy. Here we were again, but this time in court. She was the suspect, and I was the victim&#39;s family member.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat in the audience, staring intently at Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Defendant, correct your attitude. The law grants you rights, but it also imposes obligations you must fulfill.&#34; Stephen&#39;s face was cold as he slowly said, &#34;On the night of November 10, 2024, around 9 PM, which room were you in at the True Love Entertainment Club? What were you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura sighed, looking helpless. It seemed this question had been asked a million times. She said lightly, &#34;Room 5 on the fourth floor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stephen asked, &#34;Why did you come here? Did you have an appointment with someone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura replied, &#34;I come here often, to hang out with friends. Your Honor, it&#39;s consensual, not prostitution.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stephen frowned and continued, &#34;Room 7 on the fourth floor is opposite yours. Do you know who was inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura hesitated for a moment and then said, &#34;It was Alan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stephen said, &#34;Defendant, according to the investigation, the DNA found under your fingernails matches the victim&#39;s. How do you explain this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was having fun with my friend, and the door to the room wasn&#39;t closed. Alan might have seen it and thought I was being attacked, so he fought with that person. I accidentally scratched Alan&#39;s hand while trying to break up the fight.&#34; Laura said, looking at her nails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat. As expected, Alan went straight to the Entertainment Club instead of Serene Restaurant. What was he doing there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stephen continued, &#34;Defendant, we found a surgical knife used for dissecting bodies in the corner of the crime scene. Your fingerprints were on the knife. Please explain your statement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. After my friends left, I was very tired and fell asleep on the sofa.&#34; Laura said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stephen said, &#34;Defendant, according to the statement of the Entertainment Club&#39;s cleaner, during the entire time of the incident, only Room 5 and Room 7 had guests. In other words, no one else had the opportunity to commit the crime. How do you explain this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The information presented in court flashed quickly through my mind. The time, place, and suspect all matched. Laura&#39;s statement seemed weak. Where did her calm confidence come from?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, the defense attorney, who had been silent, stood up and said, &#34;Your Honor, a crucial piece of information has been overlooked. Near 9 PM, just ten minutes before the victim&#39;s death, there was a power outage! At that time, no matter who came, it was impossible to investigate! I insist on pleading not guilty for my client.&#34;</p>
