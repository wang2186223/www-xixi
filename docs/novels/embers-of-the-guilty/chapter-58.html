                <p>The car was parked right in front of the insurance company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was my first time here. The insurance company was a standalone building with &#34;K.Berkshire&#34; hanging above it. It looked pretty impressive. I remembered the name from the policy and was sure it was the same company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard jumped out of the car faster than usual, looking unusually eager. I got out with a look of disdain. Business people were never as simple as they seemed. Howard&#39;s warm-hearted and loyal reputation was just a facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we walked in, the security guard at the front desk stopped us. &#34;Hello, sir. Do you have an appointment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard glanced at me, not wanting to look awkward in front of his subordinate. He patted his expensive suit, which he rarely wore, and cleared his throat, &#34;Howard Martin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Mr. Martin. Do you have an appointment?&#34; The guard was super professional, with a polite smile on his face. I almost laughed out loud, silently watching Howard squirm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard looked embarrassed, glared at the security guard, and pointed to himself, &#34;I, Howard Martin, haven&#39;t you heard of me? Founder of the Silverlight City Legal Journal.&#34; Then he pointed to me, &#34;This is Nancy Johnson, editor-in-chief and senior partner of the Silverlight City Legal Journal. Do we need an appointment to come here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did I agree to this senior partner position? This guy just gave me a title...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Ms. Johnson. I&#39;m sorry, I haven&#39;t received any news about an interview from the Silverlight City Legal Journal. How about this, you can sit on the lobby sofa and wait for a moment. I&#39;ll call my superior, and if there&#39;s any news, I&#39;ll let you in immediately.&#34; The security guard was very polite, bowed slightly, and took out his phone to make a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you believe that if we write a news article tomorrow, your company won&#39;t be able to continue? Do you even know whose territory this is? You are so arrogant...&#34; Howard said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that he was about to embarrass himself, Howard rolled up his sleeves, ready to argue. I quickly pulled him back and smiled at the security guard, &#34;Sorry, we&#39;re here to find someone. Is Mr. Tom Harris here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tom Harris?&#34; The security guard frowned, &#34;Sorry, we don&#39;t seem to have a client named Tom Harris here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Howard!&#34; Just then, a man came out of the VIP room in the lobby and greeted us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Tom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a while since I last saw him in court. He still looked the same, with medium-short hair slicked back with thick hair gel, gold-rimmed glasses that made him look refined, and a well-fitted gray suit that looked expensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After exchanging a few words with the manager from the VIP room, he quickly walked towards us. Seeing that he knew us, the security guard didn&#39;t stop us anymore, apologized, and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tom! Making big money again, huh?&#34; Howard patted Tom&#39;s shoulder boldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Howard, you&#39;re kidding me. I&#39;m here to discuss some business. I just finished and saw you. Are you here for business too? Let&#39;s sit on the lobby sofa and catch up. It&#39;s been a while, and I can learn a thing or two about business from you, Mr. Martin.&#34; Tom said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the three of us sat on the lobby sofa, and the waiter brought three cups of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m getting old and want to customize an insurance policy.&#34; Howard touched his nose and smiled perfunctorily, with a hint of smugness in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And this is...&#34; Tom&#39;s expression changed slightly when he saw me, and he asked with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me introduce you formally, the former prosecutor of Silverlight City, the top contributor to the Silverlight City Legal Journal, my right-hand assistant, our company&#39;s reporter and editor-in-chief, Nancy Johnson!&#34; Howard said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t pay attention to Howard&#39;s exaggerated commercial flattery. I nodded slightly to Tom and smiled, &#34;Hello, Mr. Harris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that look in his eyes, I knew he recognized me from the courtroom, even though I was wearing sunglasses that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I was curious. The victim&#39;s family sat on the left side of the courtroom, and the witnesses sat on the other side. He shouldn&#39;t have seen me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that Tony or Zack tipped him off? If so, then Howard&#39;s repeated attempts to meet him might be because he already knew I was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Ms. Johnson. Nice to meet you.&#34; Tom stood up, ready to shake my hand, with a very good attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up and shook his hand, smiling, &#34;Really, Mr. Harris? I remember this should be our second meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, all the pleasantries were pointless. I needed to confirm his connection to the case and his relationship with Zack and Tony. So, I went straight to the point, no pretense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he saw me, he was already flustered. I didn&#39;t know why, but I was sure he was in turmoil inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard was also stunned by my words, then pretended to be confused and laughed, &#34;You two really have a connection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do we?&#34; Tom frowned, thought seriously for a moment, and apologized, &#34;I&#39;m really sorry, Ms. Johnson. Please forgive me, I truly forgot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Silverlight City Court, True Love Entertainment Club murder case. Mr. Harris, you were a witness at the trial. Have you forgotten so quickly?&#34; I said calmly, watching Tom&#39;s expression closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom responded, suddenly realizing, and repeatedly apologized with a smile, &#34;I remember now. When I left the courtroom, I saw you talking to a young reporter from the Silverlight City Legal Journal. Since this newspaper was founded by Howard, I thought about saying hello, but seeing you talking to the reporter and having other matters to attend to, I left. Ms. Johnson, you are indeed a legal professional, with an amazing memory. I admire you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recalled that day. I did say a few words to Zoey. At that time, Tom and I had brief eye contact from a distance, but this reason seemed too far-fetched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that was my apprentice, Zoey.&#34; I didn&#39;t intend to say any more pleasantries and went straight to the point, &#34;After listening to the trial that day, I found many doubts in the case. Since we&#39;ve run into each other today, can we talk in detail about what you saw that day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom took off his glasses and rubbed his temples, looking very tired. He occasionally glanced at Howard, indicating that he didn&#39;t want to answer this question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard, at this moment, was engrossed in a cooking show on his phone, nodding occasionally, deeply engrossed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This matter has been over for a while. The memories of that day are not pleasant. If it&#39;s not a mandatory cooperation, can we talk another day? I have some matters to attend to.&#34; Tom stood up to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about this, Mr. Harris. I remember you said you were waiting for a client that day. May I ask the client&#39;s name?&#34; I stood up and stopped Tom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Business secret, no comment.&#34; Tom&#39;s face turned livid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it Alan Smith?&#34; I said calmly. Tom&#39;s mind was already in chaos. Mentioning Alan&#39;s name would surely expose his facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Johnson, as a journalist with experience in the prosecutor&#39;s office, please always be mindful of your identity. Do not falsely accuse others. This is not good for the reputation of the Silverlight City Legal Journal.&#34; Tom adjusted his glasses and sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although he was speaking to me, he was looking at Howard. The meaning was clear. This was a threat and a warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard seemed not to hear, picked up his phone, and made a call, &#34;Hello? Zoey, it&#39;s Howard. How about dinner tonight...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously, Howard? You could at least fake it better-your phone was still playing the short video!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was speechless but also very touched. Howard was helping me this time, not knowing about Tom&#39;s doing initially. Moreover, he didn&#39;t care about Tom&#39;s warning, clearly taking a risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if I&#39;m not acting as a legal professional?&#34; I said calmly, looking coldly at Tom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Tom asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Today, I&#39;m asking you as a family member of the victim,&#34; I replied.</p>
