                <p>Silverlight City, winter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky was a dull gray, and the biting wind made it feel like the winter of 2024 would never end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smog had reduced visibility to almost nothing, barely twenty feet. The few cars on the street had their headlights on, cutting through the fog like searchlights in a post-apocalyptic scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memories were so vivid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over twenty years ago, after the fire at the old steel mill, Joseph, who was still trying to change his body&#39;s estrogen levels, had survived by hiding in a storage room, dressed in girls&#39; clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Frank who had placed him there when the fire broke out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t come out. This is the farthest corner of the old steel mill. The storage room has a vent, so you&#39;ll get fresh air and won&#39;t suffocate. If the fire ends and everyone else is dead, I&#39;ll come find you, and we&#39;ll leave this place together. Listen, Joseph, you can&#39;t die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed put, unmoving, as the flames roared and the cries for help filled his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know how much time had passed when he saw, through the cracks, glowing objects moving around in the smoke-filled, low-visibility environment, like the eyes of monsters. He was terrified and covered his mouth to stay silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the door opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several flashlight beams pierced the darkness. He instinctively closed his eyes, his delicate face and long eyelashes making him look like a fragile porcelain doll awaiting its fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long while, he opened his beautiful eyes and looked up at the police officers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stared at the long-haired child in girls&#39; clothes, puzzled by the small lump forming in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you a boy or a girl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer, his eyes wide as he looked at the charred remains of the room. The blockage in his chest suddenly burst free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cried out, &#34;I&#39;m a boy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The locked hotel door was finally unlocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the smoggy weather, visibility was extremely low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the gray haze, the scattered car lights flickered faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph frowned, the fragments of his memory making him uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never escaped the old steel mill. After the fire, the police took him away, and thanks to Ronald&#39;s maneuvering, he soon found himself in Shadow City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door from his childhood memories, which he thought led to freedom, turned out to be just a transfer to another prison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fate had sentenced him to life imprisonment in its own name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph stepped out of the hotel door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His steps were steady and firm, with no hint of post-trauma relief or relaxation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. There were only a few left. Every time he smoked, Evelyn would softly nag him. He hesitated but lit one anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph exhaled a puff of smoke, the mist swirling around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone was waiting for him ahead. When he saw the person, Joseph smiled and walked over leisurely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man in the black trench coat looked sharp, with his hair slicked back and gold-rimmed glasses, exuding an air of high society. The Maybach beside him underscored his status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not mad at me?&#34; Tom smiled as he saw Joseph, speaking lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you!&#34; Joseph laughed and cursed, the two men sharing a knowing high-five and a light punch to each other&#39;s chests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom said, &#34;Hop in. I&#39;ll take you to see Frank.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Joseph replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom gave him a puzzled look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph didn&#39;t say anything, taking a deep drag on his cigarette and blowing smoke rings at the Maybach, squinting at the car that so many young people dreamed of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly chuckled and said, &#34;What? I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you, is this car really yours? You used to drive it around, showing off, and I always wanted to ask but never did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think?&#34; Tom smiled, looking at his old friend. &#34;Once everything&#39;s over, you can drive this car. Take Evelyn for a spin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Joseph scoffed, rolling his eyes at Tom, looking like someone who didn&#39;t understand the value of money, and said, &#34;I can&#39;t even afford the gas!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom chuckled, shaking his head. The boy who once pretended to be a girl had now become a confident man, albeit a bit rough around the edges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ronald&#39;s been arrested.&#34; Tom&#39;s voice carried a barely contained excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph paused, nodding without speaking, but his demeanor changed. He leaned against the car, staring at the nearly finished cigarette, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All these years, Frank and I have been gathering evidence of Ronald&#39;s crimes, waiting for this day. Frank filed a formal complaint, and the evidence was solid. The state has issued a warrant, and Laura has been exonerated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom&#39;s pride was evident as he reached out for a cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You smoke?&#34; Joseph asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you kidding me? Who gave me my first cigarette?&#34; Tom laughed, clearly in a good mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph pulled out his pack, offering three cigarettes to Tom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was their college habit-sharing half their cigarettes when one was out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tom took one, lighting it up. The cheap cigarette was harsh on his throat, but he enjoyed it. He rarely smoked, only on special occasions, like a victor celebrating with champagne and cigars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These three cigarettes, one for you, one for Frank, and one for Alan. Make sure they get them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last cigarette in the pack was for himself, a common practice among smokers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph lit his final cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Tom asked, sensing something off about Joseph today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. I know where Alan is. I&#39;m not an idiot. Those two have been at it their whole lives. Just give it to them. They&#39;ll understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph leaned against the Maybach, squinting, and after a long pause, he said, &#34;Do you think Frank did all this for us, for himself, or for Laura?&#34;</p>
