                <p>When I heard Tony had quit, my first thought was that he might be running from something, but that didn&#39;t make sense. There was no evidence linking him to anything, and I had just been at Tammy&#39;s place yesterday, so it couldn&#39;t have escalated that fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The exec asked, &#34;When did he quit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James thought for a second, then looked at the exec and said, &#34;It&#39;s been a while, like end of April, so about six months ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was a pretty long time ago, so it seemed like his quitting had nothing to do with the case. But since I couldn&#39;t talk to Tony directly and I was already at his company, I figured his old coworkers might spill more than he would. Plus, James seemed a bit on edge around the exec. Asking too much in front of him might not get me anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked, &#34;What kind of guy is Tony? What did he usually do around here? Can you fill me in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James said, &#34;His job was pretty basic: handling company documents, maintaining the website, writing posts, stuff like that. It was a mixed bag, really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, our company&#39;s pretty open about promotions. If you bring value, the sky&#39;s the limit,&#34; the exec added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vibe was a bit off. Carol had only told them I was here to find someone, not why, so they probably thought I was here to blame someone. If I kept pushing, I might just get useless info.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I asked Carol to help me look into Tony. I don&#39;t know him personally and have no business with him,&#34; I said with a smile, trying to ease the tension. &#34;I just want to know what Tony was like at the company, so the more details, the better. Thanks for your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought for a moment. Since James was Tony&#39;s direct boss, there was no need for the exec to stick around. Plus, James might open up more if the exec wasn&#39;t there. After some polite chit-chat, the exec said he had something to do, told James to make sure I got satisfactory answers, and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Robinson, now that the exec&#39;s gone, can you give me the full scoop?&#34; I said, then called the waiter and ordered us some coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, no need to be so formal. The exec told me to be straight with you,&#34; James said, looking around nervously. He made sure no one was nearby, then lowered his voice and asked, &#34;Do you have any connection to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m friends with Carol, your company&#39;s investor. She got the exec to help me out,&#34; I said calmly, dropping Carol&#39;s name. After years in the business world, I deeply understood that without sufficient clout, merely asking questions wouldn&#39;t yield much. They wouldn&#39;t go out of their way for nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, James&#39;s attitude shifted. It was better to get in good with an investor than an exec. He said, &#34;I know Tony well. He was under my supervision. I saw him every day and got weekly reports from him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of guy is he? How did he do at the company?&#34; I asked directly, seeing that James was ready to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James replied, &#34;Well, Tony was a bit of an oddball. He was really refined, didn&#39;t talk much, loved to read, and spoke like he was straight out of a classic novel. He was in his thirties, had no real ambition, and spent his days writing poems. Honestly, he seemed more like an editor for an old-school magazine than someone in the internet industry. Sometimes I wanted to tell him to switch careers. This job is fine for recent grads as a stepping stone, but not for the long haul.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the waiter brought the coffee, James quickly stood up, paid with his work card, handed me a cup, and continued, &#34;Work-wise, he wasn&#39;t super motivated, but he wasn&#39;t slacking off either. He got his tasks done on time but never went the extra mile. He hated working overtime, which is rare in this industry. His attendance was so-so; he was often late, so his performance score was low. If it were anyone else, I would&#39;ve fired him ages ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyone else? Did he have some special status?&#34; I asked, remembering Anna had mentioned she recommended Tony for the job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well...&#34; James scratched his head, giving a knowing smile, and said hesitantly, &#34;He... had some connections to get this job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;I also want to know more about Tony. If you help me out, I&#39;ll make sure to mention it to Carol. You can count on that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was about verifying what Anna had told me earlier. I needed to clear this up; otherwise, everything from Tammy, Anna, and the unseen Tony would be questionable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need. I&#39;ll tell you everything straight.&#34; James smiled, thinking that all his hard work didn&#39;t compare to a few good words in front of an investor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it Anna?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know about it.&#34; James&#39;s eyes lit up, and he gave a knowing smile. &#34;Everyone privately calls Tony a cuckold, a man living off his wife&#39;s income.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I was puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James explained, &#34;Well, his wife Anna is a signed streamer for our company. She&#39;s pretty, but her streaming income is average. It&#39;s rumored she&#39;s the mistress of a company shareholder. Even though she&#39;s married, the relationship supposedly continues. We didn&#39;t originally have a position for a new media editor in our content marketing department. It&#39;s said that Anna recommended him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does Tony know?&#34; I asked. For a man, this kind of thing was a matter of dignity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James replied, &#34;He probably doesn&#39;t. We never mentioned it in front of him, and he seems very devoted to Anna, reportedly handing over his entire salary every month, though it&#39;s not much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and continued, &#34;What was the reason for his resignation? You mentioned earlier that he had family issues. Did he specify?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to find out whether the family issues were related to the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James smiled awkwardly. &#34;Family issues weren&#39;t the reason for his resignation. With the executive here earlier, I couldn&#39;t go into detail. It was an unexpected incident in our department.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; I asked, raising my eyebrows. It seemed James really tailored his words to his audience. If I had just asked casually and left, this trip would have been in vain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James looked a bit embarrassed and rubbed his hands together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reassured him, &#34;It&#39;s okay. Go ahead. I don&#39;t know your executive, and I won&#39;t mention this to Carol. Besides, it seems the issue has already been resolved, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James replied, &#34;Alright. Tony got into a fight with someone at the company.&#34;</p>
