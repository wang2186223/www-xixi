                <p>The only people who could answer this question were the members of the University Five.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alan disappeared, Laura was controlled, and Frank never told the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But from Ronald, I got a crucial piece of information that the day Alan went to the Entertainment Club, two people were waiting for him downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald could name those two people, Bob and Mike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the arson and murder case at the Entertainment Club, Douglas&#39;s body was burned and disguised as Alan&#39;s. Everyone set Laura up. As for Alan&#39;s current whereabouts, I thought Lally and Tony knew, but they didn&#39;t say. However, when I recalled their expressions when talking about Alan, they didn&#39;t show sadness or worry, indicating that he should be safe for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Frank first met me, he cried his eyes out. He was afraid that the plan had gone wrong and Alan was dead. Later, when he learned the truth and we met at the hospital, his expression was completely different when Alan was mentioned, indirectly proving that Alan wasn&#39;t dead. At the same time, I felt that Alan wasn&#39;t with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So the result was obvious that Alan&#39;s whereabouts must be related to Bob and Mike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The most unexpected discovery was that Ronald&#39;s informant at the old steel mill was now being taken care of by Bob. Although a severe illness a few years ago left him unable to speak, as long as he&#39;s alive, there would be information. Whether from Bob or Mike, we could find out what happened during their university days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took out my phone and looked through the information Howard had previously investigated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mike was an English teacher at Harmony City Community College. I remembered when I called him, his voice was particularly despondent and listless. He only got excited after knowing it was me and started talking on his own, clearly stating that he had nothing to do with this matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob was an actor in the Shadow City Drama Troupe. Besides Laura, he was the only one from their university drama club who continued to work in theater after graduation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The difference was, when I called him, it wasn&#39;t him who answered but a woman who said Bob had just gone to sleep and hinted that I shouldn&#39;t believe everything a man said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, I thought Bob frequently changed girlfriends in college and was known as a playboy. His acting talent wasn&#39;t as good as Laura&#39;s or Frank&#39;s, but the gap wasn&#39;t that big. The key was that Bob was very handsome and sociable, changing girlfriends frequently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now that I thought about it, I had reason to suspect that after the Entertainment Club incident, Bob went back to Shadow City the next day and went to sleep. He naturally didn&#39;t tell his girlfriend the truth, which led to this situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The urgent task now was to go to Shadow City to find Bob and the informant from the old steel mill, and figure out who the little girl was that caused George&#39;s death and what exactly happened during their university days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I finished packing at home, it was already nearly 10 p.m. I lay on the sofa and planned my itinerary for tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shadow City was southeast of Silverlight City and one of the least-known cities in the state, ranking at the bottom economically. Many people in Silverlight City didn&#39;t even know Shadow City. Shadow City was right next to Silverlight City, but it was small and built at the foot of a mountain, making it inconvenient to travel to, so few people went there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But students of Silverlight University all knew about Shadow City. When we were in college, the Silverlight University branch campus was actually in Shadow City. Later, as Silverlight City expanded, the campus naturally became part of Silverlight City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Due to the poor traffic conditions, driving there tomorrow would take about two hours. Silverlight City and Shadow City were separated by the north-south boundary ridge, and driving between the two cities required taking a winding mountain road and passing through several tunnels, which was very troublesome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On my way home, I sent Bob&#39;s personal information to Ruben for help. By the time I got home, Ruben had already asked a colleague in the household registration department to find Bob&#39;s address. He didn&#39;t live in the city but in a small town, so driving there would take at least three hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was better to take the high-speed train, which would take at most forty minutes. After getting off the train, I could take a taxi to the town, which would take about twenty minutes according to the navigation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After booking a high-speed train ticket for 8 AM tomorrow, I was about to go to sleep when Zoey sent a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Mrs. Smith, where did you go today? Let me guess!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Why aren&#39;t you asleep yet? I heard from Howard that you&#39;ve been working a lot lately. Take care of yourself; your health comes first. Don&#39;t overwork yourself.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I couldn&#39;t let Zoey get involved in this case, it didn&#39;t mean I had to cut ties with her. On the contrary, I had been in contact with Zoey these days. I just tried to be vague about case-related matters. Even so, Zoey could independently judge and find out that Joseph had issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From this, I had to marvel at the power of genetics. Zoey&#39;s work efficiency was exceptionally high, and she learned things quickly, just like her mother Erica. I had experienced Zoey&#39;s talent in law. Her talent in criminal investigation might come from her father Ronald.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Mrs. Smith, don&#39;t say that. Mr. Martin is working me to death, making me do everything. I feel like a slave, working 24 hours a day!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled knowingly. Zoey was playing the victim again. A few days ago, Howard showed me Zoey&#39;s performance report. Her workload had increased, but it was far from overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Where can you find such a beautiful slave? I have seen your performance report. Your efficiency is super high. I&#39;m starting to feel threatened!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t know. You and Mr. Martin are conspiring to keep me out of this case, right? But I still found out that Joseph has issues. How about that? Under your guidance, my skills aren&#39;t bad, right?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This girl, when did I ever teach her anything about criminal investigation? Giving me credit for this was unfair, so I typed:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[I have to marvel at the power of genetics. I think you are like your mother, but I don&#39;t expect...]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Don&#39;t expect me to be like my dad too, right?] Zoey sent a smiling emoji and continued: [So you went to the True Love Entertainment Club today to see my dad just for praising me, right?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something&#39;s off. How did Zoey know I went to the Entertainment Club area to find Ronald today?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Howard tell her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was thinking, the sound of a Facebook video notification went off. Zoey was sending a video invitation.</p>
