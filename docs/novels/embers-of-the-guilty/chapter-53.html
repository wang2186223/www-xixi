                <p>Until it was very late and I was about to leave, Tony adamantly insisted that he didn&#39;t know Tom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also mentioned that the orphanage was gone and didn&#39;t want to talk about the past anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t push it, knowing I wouldn&#39;t get anything out of him. From his expression, it seemed like he didn&#39;t know about Lally&#39;s disappearance either. When I brought it up, he got all uneasy and anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would he be so concerned about the living but show no emotion for the dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus, while chatting with Tony, I suddenly remembered something from over ten years ago. When Alan had just graduated and moved to Sand Village, I called him, and he came over right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But according to Tony, Alan was super nervous back then, like he was worried I&#39;d find out about his connection to Sand Village, like he was hiding something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it a painful memory? If it was, why would he go back? And this place wasn&#39;t an orphanage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one possibility. Ten years ago, he and the folks from Sand Village were up to something together, hiding it from me, scared I&#39;d find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, there was another important detail. When Tony talked about his relationship with Zack, he was really protective of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony showed me his diagnosis notice, which looked legit. He really had a terminal illness, and considering that, he had a reason to buy a big insurance policy for Tammy with a hefty payout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Tony only paid $500,000 for the policy, while Zack paid $1,500,000. Could Zack be sick too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That explanation didn&#39;t really add up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zack, Tom... I had a hunch that Tony definitely knew Tom, and the relationship between Zack and Tom must be close!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While driving, I kept thinking about it. Could Tom be from the orphanage too, or did he live in Sand Village? It seemed too coincidental. Plus, during the trial, Tom&#39;s clothes and the car he drove didn&#39;t match someone from a slum or an orphanage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silverlight City had already started providing heating. When I got home, the whole house was warm, and I even felt a bit hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, my dad sent a message: [Is the heating on?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been busy with the case lately, and with Alan not home, I didn&#39;t have time to pay the heating bill. Luckily, my dad remembered and paid for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy: [Yes, it&#39;s warm!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dad replied: [Nancy, are you busy this weekend? Want to come home and see this lonely old man?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a pang of sadness. After thinking about it, I decided to keep it from my dad for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy: [Don&#39;t worry, Dad, I&#39;ll definitely come. But Alan is on a business trip this week, attending a state exchange meeting, and probably won&#39;t be back until next week.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dad replied: [I knew my son-in-law was promising. He&#39;s already attending a state exchange meeting. Back in our days, only the top performers could go!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy: [Alright, you go to sleep. Your son-in-law is definitely excellent. Do I have a bad eye for people?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying this, my eyes welled up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These days, Alan&#39;s past has gradually come to light, but everyone connected to him seems to be hiding something from me, even Alan, who started hiding things ten years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could there be a connection between Zack, Tony, and Tom?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly remembered that I had taken a picture of Tony&#39;s motorcycle license plate while tailing him in the morning. I quickly pulled out my photo album: [SilverlightD·K6329]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Motorcycle license plates often have lucky numbers or the owner&#39;s birthday, and the letters usually match the owner&#39;s initials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The letter &#34;K&#34; didn&#39;t fit Tony at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hopped on Facebook and found Ruben&#39;s profile picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy: [Ruben, you there?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds later, Ruben replied: [Yes, Mrs. Smith! Always ready to help. Need to catch someone?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the clock; it was already past 11 PM. I sent him the photo of Tony&#39;s motorcycle license plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy: [Sorry to bother you so late. Two things, no rush, you can reply tomorrow.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruben: [Mrs. Smith, you can speak! I&#39;ll get it done efficiently!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy: [First, help me find out who owns this motorcycle license plate; second, check if there was an orphanage within 7 miles of Sand Village twenty years ago. Also, keep looking for Lally; she shouldn&#39;t be with Tony.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruben: [Got it, Mrs. Smith! No problem! By the way, is Ms. Taylor with you?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typical Benjamin&#39;s apprentice, always up to something and thinking differently. It was past 11 PM; why would Zoey be with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy: [No, Zoey is probably already resting at this hour.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruben: [Right, Mrs. Smith, can I have Zoey&#39;s contact info?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was exactly the same. When Benjamin wanted Cindy&#39;s contact info, he also sent me a text message. Could it be that this was taught by Benjamin as well?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helping me with business while trying to set up Ruben and Zoey. This guy was getting smarter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought for a moment and sent a screenshot to Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, Zoey replied with a shocked emoji: [This guy is still up to no good, and that Mr. Wright, pretending to help you while secretly matchmaking for his apprentice. Mrs. Smith, just curious, did you set up Mr. Wright when he was pursuing your roommate?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled. Zoey was smart; she probably guessed it was Benjamin&#39;s idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy: [Yes, you guessed it.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied, adding a smiley emoji.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey: [Sure, send him my Facebook card. They are helping us, so we should give them some reward.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey sent another message: [I never do good deeds, only deal with those with delusions. I&#39;ve had many guys pursue me; some even set up flowers and candles under the university building, singing. I went down and stomped them out one by one. That guy covered his face and ran away, never to appear in front of me again!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied: [Benjamin did the same thing.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey replied: [A match made in heaven, master and apprentice, hahaha, I&#39;m dying of laughter.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Ruben called, &#34;Hello, Mrs. Smith? I asked a friend in the traffic police department to check the motorcycle license plate. The owner is Zack Garcia, registered in 2010. As for the orphanage near Sand Village, I&#39;ll have to check tomorrow. Orphanages are managed by the social services department, and I have a classmate there, but they are off work now. Unlike police, who are on high alert 24/7.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it Zack&#39;s motorcycle? But thinking about it carefully, it made sense that Tony was riding Zack&#39;s motorcycle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looks like the license plate didn&#39;t give us much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;Thank you, please follow up on the orphanage matter tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruben responded, &#34;No problem, Mrs. Smith, I&#39;ll definitely give you an answer tomorrow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I said, &#34;Thanks. By the way, you wanted Zoey&#39;s contact info, right? I just asked her, and she&#39;s okay with it. I&#39;ll send it to you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy on the other end of the phone was almost jumping with joy, pleasantly surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good luck, young man. Everyone&#39;s success was unique, including your mentor.</p>
