                <p>True Love Entertainment Club used to be an old steel factory, and that factory was once a child trafficking camp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything makes sense now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get why they were all so secretive about the location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s why Lally and Tammy worked at the Entertainment Club. Their revenge plan had been brewing for ages, and of course, it involved Frank, Tony, and Tom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also get why Tom and Tony took out such a big insurance policy on Tammy. The risk was just too high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, it makes sense why Tony, Lally, Tom, and Tammy were all there the night Alan had his accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Revenge!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calm down, my heart was racing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why were they at the Entertainment Club? There&#39;s only one reason!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their revenge was aimed at the Entertainment Club!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why else would Lally go into such a hellish place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following this logic, Alan must have known about their plan that night. He went to stop them but ended up getting killed by the crime syndicate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or, like Frank said, was Laura the target all along?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t think straight, but it didn&#39;t matter now. I found a crucial piece of evidence; the place where the kids were trafficked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The location of this Entertainment Club was so unique they even built a special road for it. To secure such a spot and specifically refer to the old steel factory, the boss behind the Entertainment Club had to be someone powerful. Plus, the reason the old steel factory could secretly imprison a bunch of kids without getting caught was probably because of his influence!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to keep my excitement in check and only mentioned to Cindy and Jody about an interview article on Sand Village, wanting to dig into the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This case couldn&#39;t involve anyone else anymore. The fewer people who knew, the better. It was just too dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking back at the whole case, spanning twenty years, all the cops, prosecutors, and court staff involved were transferred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s been detained this whole time. I used to think it was just because of powerful connections among high-ranking officials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, linking it to the Entertainment Club, I had an even scarier thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe from child trafficking to the Entertainment Club, that big shot has been involved from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, no one else could get involved in this anymore, including Zoey and Howard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard was easy to handle, but for Zoey, I needed to find something to keep her busy and distracted so she wouldn&#39;t have the energy to deal with this case. Otherwise, with Zoey&#39;s personality, she definitely wouldn&#39;t let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, I chatted with Cindy for a bit and politely turned down her offer to stay overnight. I took the elevator down and quickly ran to the parking lot!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I needed to investigate the Entertainment Club!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they realized it, I contacted someone they didn&#39;t expect, and they definitely didn&#39;t see me focusing on the Entertainment Club so soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I dug into the boss, shareholders, and other management behind the Entertainment Club one by one, I would definitely uncover the original crime syndicate!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, all the grudges and mysteries would finally be put to rest!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jumped in the car and fired up the engine!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, my phone rang. It was Leonard from the prosecutor&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked the time; it was past 9 PM. Why would he call this late? Did something happen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leonard, what&#39;s up? Why are you calling so late? Did something happen?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause on the other end, like Leonard wasn&#39;t used to this kind of conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I realized I hadn&#39;t really checked in on him in a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After college, I went straight to the prosecutor&#39;s office. Leonard wasn&#39;t the deputy chief prosecutor back then; he got promoted a few years later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Leonard was my direct supervisor. He was super strict, but I was young and eager to prove myself, so I stuck it out and got the job done. The office staff were shocked; I was the first newbie to last more than two months under Leonard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was impressed with me, and I was grateful to him. Once, during a meal, he jokingly asked me to call him &#34;Master.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh out of college, I laughed it off and said, &#34;What era is this? I&#39;ll call you that when you retire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before things got tense between us, we had a great relationship, like mentor and friend. Leonard seemed stiff on the outside, but I knew he secretly wanted to go fishing, dancing, and traveling. He&#39;d only relax and joke around with me occasionally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing, don&#39;t worry,&#34; Leonard&#39;s voice softened a bit. After a pause, he asked, &#34;Where are you now? Are you busy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m driving, just left Cindy&#39;s place, heading home to rest,&#34; I lied. I planned to handle this case solo, so I didn&#39;t tell Leonard the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, no problem. I just wanted to see if we could grab a meal sometime,&#34; Leonard said. Then I heard him tap the phone twice with his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got it immediately. A few years back, during an anti-corruption case, corrupt officials bugged the prosecutor&#39;s office. Leonard and I avoided phone conversations and met in person instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless it was urgent, we agreed to tap the phone once after talking, signaling to meet at the office ASAP.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed Leonard had found something big. I turned the car around and headed to the city prosecutor&#39;s office. Information could wait; Leonard&#39;s safety was the priority. It looked like he had been investigating secretly, putting himself at risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I parked in a lot near the prosecutor&#39;s office. Instead of driving straight in, I used a little-known side entrance. No surveillance cameras here, so no one would know I was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From now on, I had to be extra careful about everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was close to 10 PM. Even though I hadn&#39;t been here in years, nothing had changed. I navigated the familiar path, avoiding surveillance, and entered Leonard&#39;s office building through a side door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonard&#39;s office was on the third floor. Before going in, I noticed only his office light was on, which wasn&#39;t surprising given his reputation for diligence.</p>
