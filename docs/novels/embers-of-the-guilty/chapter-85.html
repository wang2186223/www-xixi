                <p>The moment Evelyn spoke, her lips split open, and blood started dripping, covering her entire mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an overcast day, the sky all gray and gloomy, making the winter day feel even more bleak and desolate. Everything around had this gray-black vibe, adding to the solemn mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her bright red lips stood out like a splash of blood in a black-and-white photo, cold and tragic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to ask you, what does &#39;lifestyle issues&#39; even mean?&#34; Evelyn shot a cold glance at the people in the court. &#34;Isn&#39;t it just persecution? Why don&#39;t you go after the big shots instead of hassling regular folks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the court staff sternly replied, &#34;Ma&#39;am, please be responsible for your words and actions. If an official commits a crime, we won&#39;t cover it up or insult the law. Joseph is still under investigation and isn&#39;t here. We really don&#39;t know the situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were so many people outside, and Evelyn was speaking freely. Bystanders were snapping photos and videos, which could end up online, causing a public opinion storm and hurting the government&#39;s credibility. It was no small matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you want to know who reported this?&#34; Evelyn stared at the staff member. &#34;Doesn&#39;t your dean know about this? Pretending to be deaf and mute usually, but now, after getting some news, hurriedly reporting it for credit. Is it because that big shot was dismissed, and he can take the position?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The court staff warned, &#34;Miss! Watch your words, or we&#39;ll call the police!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead, I&#39;ll say the same thing in front of the police.&#34; Evelyn said calmly. &#34;The guard won&#39;t let me in, so I&#39;ll wait for your dean to come out. As long as Joseph isn&#39;t released, I&#39;ll stand here. While he&#39;s being interrogated, how can I sit at home peacefully? I&#39;ll stick with him to the end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd around was growing, and the staff member had already taken out his phone to call the police. If not stopped, the situation would escalate, and it would be hard to resolve. Evelyn might even end up at the police station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was the point of that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed through the crowd and stepped forward. &#34;Evelyn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn turned to look at me, a hint of confusion in her eyes, &#34;Police?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied, &#34;Nancy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stiff body suddenly trembled, her legs gave way, and she was about to fall. I quickly stepped forward to support her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn looked at me, tears streaming down her face, her lips trembling slightly, &#34;Nancy, I... I... I have something to tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not here, too many people.&#34; I glanced at the crowd. The court staff were surprised by my appearance, not expecting Evelyn to lower her guard after seeing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The court staff asked, &#34;Hello, may I ask who you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nancy Johnson, editor-in-chief of the Silverlight City Legal Journal. Our editorial team is very interested in this incident and wants to interview this lady. I must remind you that the crowd is still filming, and my recorder is on. I believe you can quickly come up with a solution.&#34; I smiled and showed my press card. &#34;If the situation gets out of control, maybe I should be the one calling the police.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, upon hearing my name, their attitude changed immediately. They came forward to greet me, &#34;Oh, Ms. Johnson, you should have said earlier. We were worried for nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though the Silverlight City Legal Journal wasn&#39;t an official publication, it had a solid reputation in Silverlight City and the whole state. We had worked with both city and state courts, even providing media training for the court&#39;s publicity department. So, my name was pretty well-known around here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That makes things easier. I&#39;ll take her with me and solve your problem,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff member looked a bit doubtful and cautiously asked, &#34;Do you know her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why did she suddenly...&#34; the court staff started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try standing outside in the winter for a day,&#34; I snorted, giving him a look. &#34;If it wasn&#39;t for sheer willpower, she would&#39;ve collapsed long ago. I&#39;ll take her to the hospital first. If you stop me, I won&#39;t hesitate to become her lawyer and file a lawsuit. If legal professionals lack compassion, what&#39;s the point of studying law? Seems like you guys need more training.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, your help is greatly appreciated,&#34; the court staff said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They quickly stepped aside. My car was parked by the roadside, and I helped Evelyn into the car and drove away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. She said she was in good health and it wasn&#39;t a big deal. So, we found a restaurant and asked the waiter for a private room. Although it was unusual for two people to get a private room, it was around 3 PM, not a busy time, so they agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ordered some hot dishes and soup for Evelyn to warm up and get her energy back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After eating, Evelyn seemed better, so I asked, &#34;How much do you know about Joseph&#39;s situation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn&#39;s expression darkened. She bit her lip, hesitating for a long time, her eyes red, and said softly, &#34;I only know he has a connection with some big shot, but I don&#39;t know who.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said earlier that Joseph was persecuted by that big shot?&#34; I paused, unsure how to ask. Evelyn had said they weren&#39;t in that kind of relationship, and it was persecution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s normal, it&#39;s that person who&#39;s not. But he won&#39;t say anything, just because he doesn&#39;t want to lose his job, so...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn nodded, then started crying. &#34;I know he has many secrets. In his dreams, he often talks in his sleep, calling out names. He doesn&#39;t want to say, and I don&#39;t force him. For a man, it&#39;s already painful enough. I can&#39;t add to his pain. But... it&#39;s so painful. Our life feels dismembered, cruelly shattered. I can&#39;t do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life feeling dismembered, how much hardship must one endure to use such a metaphor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alan, Frank, Laura, Bob, Mike, Lally, Duke, Tom...&#34; I listed the names in one breath, then said sadly, &#34;Are these the names?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn nodded. My guess was right; Joseph was one of the children from that concentration camp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn said, &#34;They...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, just some friends. How did you know about me?&#34; I changed the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Joseph hadn&#39;t told her, I wouldn&#39;t bring it up. Why burden his wife with such a tragic past? Life was already hard enough, with past demons still haunting them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn replied, &#34;Before Joseph was taken away, he called me. Maybe he sensed something and told me to remember your name. If you didn&#39;t come to find me, it meant nothing happened. If you did, I was to give you two messages.&#34;</p>
