                <p>She opened her eyes and reconnected with the world around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt confused, like she was in a dream, and closed her eyes again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, she let out a soft sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re awake?&#34; I asked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lally nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you feeling? Any pain or anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks.&#34; She shook her head and glanced around. &#34;How much is the medical bill? I&#39;ll pay you back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about that right now. Just rest. Mr. Wright already handled the hospital stuff,&#34; I said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I have no money,&#34; Lally said quietly, sadness in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Use mine!&#34; I offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Working at the District Attorney&#39;s office and the Silverlight City Legal Journal, I&#39;d seen how medical bills could wreck lives. Silverlight City might look prosperous with its rising GDP, but a lot of people still couldn&#39;t afford medical care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The skyscrapers and economic growth were just a facade; the real story was in the lives of the people struggling at the bottom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, but I should go home now,&#34; Lally replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to sit up, but I gently stopped her. &#34;At least wait until the doctor checks you out. Stay here for the night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t argue, slowly lying back down and looking out the window at the bright city lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her quietly. Her eyes reflected the glitzy Silverlight City outside. Gradually, her vision blurred, and the city&#39;s illusions seemed to wash away with her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Lally said hoarsely, her pale lips barely moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing. Everyone has tough times. If I ever hit rock bottom, I&#39;m sure you&#39;d help me too,&#34; I said, pouring a glass of water and placing it beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lally sighed softly. This detail was something that only someone who had experienced life and seen people humbled to the dust could truly feel. There were many people in life who even sighed with caution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax, it&#39;s all over,&#34; I comforted her gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a reporter, right?&#34; Lally glanced at the badge on my chest and forced a smile. &#34;It&#39;s okay, ask whatever you want. If it weren&#39;t for you, I wouldn&#39;t be here. Maybe I&#39;d be dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s wait until you feel better. I&#39;m not in a hurry. I&#39;m just here to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took off my badge and put it in my bag. &#34;What do you want to eat? I&#39;ll get you something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, just talking is fine,&#34; Lally said, shaking her head slightly and forcing a smile. &#34;You have a good heart. You&#39;ll be rewarded.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would I be rewarded?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart ached a bit, and Alan&#39;s image floated into my mind. If good people always got rewarded, why was there so much suffering in the world?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the fragile and empty Lally in front of me, it was hard to believe she had given false testimony in court. Maybe I just wanted to clear her name quickly. I sat down beside her. &#34;My name is Nancy Johnson. Just call me Nancy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so envious of you, Nancy,&#34; Lally said softly, staring at the ceiling. &#34;It&#39;s not about the job. It&#39;s more like... you have this calm, strong vibe, like you can protect everyone around you. I don&#39;t have that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she still thinking about Duke? Her words seemed to hint at wanting to know Duke&#39;s whereabouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Duke&#39;s been arrested for drug trafficking, rape, and assault. You... you&#39;ve actually done really well. Everyone has their own choices and paths to follow. You can&#39;t protect someone forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to tell her she didn&#39;t need to worry about these things anymore, but as an outsider looking at the victim, I couldn&#39;t fully understand her feelings. However, I had to respect her choices and actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand, thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared blankly at the ceiling, showing neither sadness nor joy. After a long time, she said slowly, &#34;Nancy, you&#39;re really kind. Over the years, many people have told me to stay away from Duke. Later, I became a laughingstock, with people saying I was foolish for being with such a man. They weren&#39;t wrong... Maybe I really don&#39;t have any strength left, just wanting to hold on to this little bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever you do, good or bad, only you know in your heart. Everyone has different perspectives and sees things differently, but you...&#34; I tried to comfort her, but the harsh reality was right in front of us. Words felt so empty and inadequate. I didn&#39;t know how to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deserved it?&#34; Lally laughed self-deprecatingly. &#34;I feel like I&#39;ve died once and come back to life, but nothing has changed... Nancy, let me tell you a story about him and me. It might be a bit cumbersome since I&#39;m not well-educated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I grew up in an orphanage. Since I can remember, I&#39;ve been with Duke. He was a very good person, Nancy. Have you ever been to an orphanage?&#34; Lally asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but I&#39;ve heard friends talk about it,&#34; I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alan had mentioned the orphanage to me before. He rarely talked about that part of his life, saying the orphanage was noisy, and he was often bullied as a child. When he grew up and went to school, he never went back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, you&#39;ve probably seen those short videos of happy kids in front of the camera, but it&#39;s not really like that. We were like commodities, only wearing new clothes and eating well when people came to adopt. The rest of the time was very hard, being bullied by other kids, beaten and scolded by staff, and often not having enough to eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lally buried herself deep in the blanket, her eyes filled with fear, and said in a low voice, &#34;I don&#39;t want to remember those times. Even now, I still dream about it, being beaten every day, in a dark, damp, cold room with rats and bugs. Older kids would steal your food, drink, and even pee in your bowl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t anyone care?&#34; I frowned. Twenty years ago, Silverlight City hadn&#39;t developed yet, but as a social welfare institution, the orphanage shouldn&#39;t have been like that. It was more like a prison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nancy, we&#39;re different. I experienced despair at a very young age,&#34; Lally said.</p>
