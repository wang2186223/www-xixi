                <p>&#34;Hey Alan, did you grow up in an orphanage? What was it like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, it was pretty rough, but I got lucky. Everyone treated me well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alan, why are you so scared of the cold? It&#39;s not very manly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve always been like this. As a kid, winter felt endless. I guess it just stuck with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your boss is totally taking advantage of you, making you do everything and work late every day. You shouldn&#39;t put up with that. I&#39;m calling the Forestry Bureau tomorrow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax, it&#39;s not just me. Everyone&#39;s working overtime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a chilly winter night. After dinner, Alan was on the sofa, softly reading poetry. I had my head on his lap, half-asleep with my eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house was cozy. I was under a blanket, a bit sweaty on my forehead. Alan touched my head and asked, &#34;Do you have a fever?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded sleepily, &#34;Seems like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling hot, I pushed the blanket off, letting the cool air hit my arms and legs. My head hurt a bit, and after a while, someone covered me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get some fever medicine, hang on,&#34; Alan said gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was dizzy, thinking about moving to another spot to sleep, but I was too weak. Forget it, I&#39;d just sleep here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drifted off into a deep sleep for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had never felt this exhausted before. I used to be full of energy, working late into the night and still feeling great the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it because I was getting old?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a daze, I saw myself in the mirror with white hair, sitting in a wheelchair with a blanket on my knees, at the end of my life, about to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories flooded my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From twenty-one to thirty, I spent the first phase of my career at the District Attorney&#39;s office;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From thirty to forty, I was the chief editor and reporter at the Silverlight City Legal Journal, gaining many awards both domestically and internationally, often forgetting to thank someone in my acceptance speeches;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From fifty to sixty, the Silverlight City Journal merged with an international Legal Journal, and I traveled to various countries, taking photos with my DSLR, always leaving a spot empty in the pictures;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From sixty to seventy, I returned to Silverlight City and opened a bookstore. I sat in a chair at the door with reading glasses, watching the sunset, forgetting whether I was reading poetry or waiting for someone;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At seventy-eight, I was diagnosed with Parkinson&#39;s disease, with no children, living freely. I bought a house near the hospital, so if something happened, I could be rescued in time, or cremated if not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But throughout my life, I felt something was missing, but I couldn&#39;t remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh right, someone went to get medicine for me. Oh right, I had a fever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay there waiting for a long time, but that person never came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, I&#39;m over seventy, why haven&#39;t you come back yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, you should&#39;ve said goodbye when you left, or at least told me where you were going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I can&#39;t call you &#39;sir,&#39; I know your name. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I talked to myself, maybe because I was old, I talked a lot, forgetting what I said before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel like I know your story from somewhere, like I lived it. Others have told me, but you didn&#39;t. I&#39;m old now, I don&#39;t blame you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember now, you were always so kind. The first time I saw you, you weren&#39;t the most handsome or the best among the guys, but you were the only one I noticed. You know why? Because everyone else avoided looking at me, but you kept smiling at me, and I smiled back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should&#39;ve gotten married. We could&#39;ve gone to the prairie, the lake, the wheat fields, sunbathed on the haystacks. When we got tired, we could&#39;ve had a baby... No, wait, we did get married. So where have you been all these years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, it hit me in the wheelchair, oh right, we did get married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He appeared, so gentle and kind, walking slowly towards me in the sunlight, squatting down and looking up at me with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know why, but my heart ached faintly. Was it because I was too old? Didn&#39;t the doctor say last time that it was Parkinson&#39;s, so how did I end up with heart disease too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forget it. There weren&#39;t many days left anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why was I crying? The doctor said my tear glands had degenerated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With tears in my eyes, I touched his face and choked out, &#34;I&#39;ve been looking for you for over forty years. Where have you been all these years? Why haven&#39;t you aged? Your name is Alan, you are my husband. Over forty years ago, on the night of November 20th, there was a big fire, and you left. I will never forget that scene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t believe Laura was the culprit. The witnesses wanted her dead, but that was false testimony. No matter who it is, they can&#39;t leave without a clear explanation. I thought I had to give you an explanation, give myself an explanation, and say a proper goodbye to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All these years, I&#39;ve suffered so much. Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How should I investigate, how should I follow the clues? I knew they were all lying, all hiding the truth, but I had no evidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all over now, we&#39;ve met, Alan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my arms and bent down to hug Alan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dizziness hit me again, and I fainted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how long it was, my whole body ached, my arms were numb, like they hadn&#39;t moved in a long time and lacked blood flow. I tried to move, my hand hurt, like something was stuck in it, and it hurt when I moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know where I was or what I was doing, but my mind became much clearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t I at Lally&#39;s house looking at photos before I went out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor, what is wrong with the patient? Why hasn&#39;t she woken up yet?&#34; It was my apprentice Zoey&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, the patient is overly tired and anxious, with poor sleep and diet, and possibly emotional stress, causing her to faint suddenly. We&#39;ve done a full-body check, she&#39;s healthy, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with her brain. Just let her rest well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she has been sleeping for a whole day and night, and she won&#39;t wake up no matter how I call her. Please, check again, I beg you, she can&#39;t have anything happen to her.&#34; Zoey&#39;s voice was choked with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had I really been asleep for a whole day and night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rest assured, the patient&#39;s bodily functions are all normal. The nurse started giving her saline and glucose this morning. There&#39;s nothing to worry about, she should wake up today if nothing unexpected happens. Just make sure no one else disturbs her, one person to watch over her is enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you so much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome, I&#39;ll get back to work.&#34;</p>
