                <p>I didn&#39;t directly expose his lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed that Ronald also intended to hide the fact that the little girl was involved in George&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I vaguely felt that this girl was somehow connected to Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What I could confirm now was that Frank had no intention of killing Laura. He might have a mix of love and hate, but no murderous intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Think about it, Laura was charming and sociable, thriving in high society and among high-ranking officials. Was it because of her high emotional intelligence, stunning beauty, or unparalleled charisma?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For ordinary people, these might be enough, but for the upper class, these might not even be an entry ticket. No one stayed young and beautiful forever, but there would always be young and beautiful people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how well Laura did, now that she was over thirty, she couldn&#39;t compete with younger girls. No matter how stunning she was, she would eventually age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if Laura had some vague connection to the old steel mill incident?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she, like Douglas, was a child turned by the old steel mill, and then collaborated with Ronald and connected with the big shots behind the scenes, everything seemed to fall into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that the truth was out, the big shots were eager to cut ties and had Laura imprisoned and trialed. Meanwhile, Tammy, Tony, Lally, Tom, and others were attacking Laura, just as the big shots planned, so they were in a hurry to sentence Laura to death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, the evidence was full of holes, and Laura&#39;s attorney, Scott, easily left the jury speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Logically, Tammy, Lally, Tom, and Tony all wanted to kill Laura, which must be due to deep hatred. Laura, who also came from the old steel mill, I couldn&#39;t imagine any other possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, logically, Laura should have been executed or died unnaturally long ago. Why was she still in custody?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was protecting Laura? I could only think of Frank, who had feelings for Laura, still could forget her, and used hatred as a disguise to numb himself and deceive others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scott?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I realized I had overlooked this key person from the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as I found out if he had any connection with Frank, then this clue could confirm that Frank was protecting Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took out my phone and quickly sent a message to Howard on Facebook:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Howard, can I still trust you now?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard must have noticed Ronald&#39;s actions over the years and must have helped him cover them up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost instantly, Howard replied:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Yes.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[I asked you to find Ronald, and Zoey is with you now. That&#39;s the biggest trust.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed and replied:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Ronald might not be as good as we thought.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Howard replied:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Yes.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed that Joseph&#39;s reason for asking me to find Ronald was not just about Alan&#39;s whereabouts. I misunderstood that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I thought about it, Howard knew I was going to find Bob and Zoey&#39;s mom, Erica, one to impound the car and the other to freeze the bank card to restrict Zoey&#39;s travel. The reason was not just for safety but to prevent Zoey from knowing the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Help me check Scott and see how much his law firm collaborates with Frank.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[No need to check. Frank&#39;s top lawyer, everyone in the legal circle knows. What&#39;s up?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Guess who the defense attorney for Laura, the defendant in the November Entertainment Club arson and murder case, is?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Scott? No... Frank, he...]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Howard sent another message:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[It doesn&#39;t matter anymore. No matter what, Zoey must not know about Ronald. I need you to promise me that.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Okay.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the general outline of the Entertainment Club arson and murder case could be determined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The big shots were indeed starting to close the net, but they didn&#39;t act on Laura first. They were waiting for an opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frank&#39;s target in the Entertainment Club arson and murder case was not Laura but Douglas. Whether Laura&#39;s presence at the Entertainment Club was intentional or accidental, I didn&#39;t know yet. But recalling the case, did Laura see Alan at that time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it was Alan, then there might have been two people in the room at the time of the incident, Alan and Douglas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not, then Laura must have seen Douglas. She said so in court to hide the plan to kill Douglas, but she didn&#39;t expect some people to turn against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The most plausible guess was that Frank and others planned to kill Douglas at the Entertainment Club, and arranged for Douglas to wait in a private room. Alan knew about the plan and went ahead to stop it but failed. The plan succeeded, but a variable appeared. The original plan was to destroy the body, making DNA unmeasurable, and the scene was destroyed. The Entertainment Club&#39;s power was cut, eliminating all camera footage. Frank had everything planned outside, with waiters Lally and Tammy as insiders. Douglas, being notorious, wouldn&#39;t dare to make a big deal out of it even if discovered. It was almost a perfect murder plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, Tammy, Lally, Tom, and Tony jumped out, turning as witnesses to accuse Laura of being the murderer, wanting to kill Laura. The big shots didn&#39;t expect such a timely opportunity and immediately used special procedures to expedite the case. Frank, eager to save Laura, quickly sent his top lawyer, Scott, to the rescue. Frank used all his connections to fight against the high-ups, which was why Laura had been in custody for so long without being released.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And precisely because of this, Frank and Tom, Tony, Lally, and others were not on the same page. Frank wanted to kill Douglas, while the others wanted to use Frank&#39;s plan to punish Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this guess was correct, then Lally, Tony, and Joseph wanted to tell me the truth behind the case and that Alan was not dead could be reasonably understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were never united, just using each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why didn&#39;t Frank tell me these things?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alan not being dead and the hidden truth behind this case, what was Frank&#39;s purpose in hiding these?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bob, I&#39;m asking you seriously one last time. I hope you answer truthfully, or I really can&#39;t help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What role did you play in this case?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
