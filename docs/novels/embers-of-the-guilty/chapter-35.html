                <p>That night, I couldn&#39;t tell if it was sudden trust or just gratitude for saving her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either way, Lally and I ended up talking a lot, like she was finally letting out everything she&#39;d been holding in for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just listened quietly, ordered some takeout, got us some light food, and after we ate a bit, it was already past 11 PM, almost midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital doc had already checked her out, and everything seemed fine. They suggested she rest for a few days. Lally told me to go home, saying she was okay and felt a bit awkward with me hanging around the hospital. I agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also called Benjamin to let him know Lally had woken up and was doing okay for now. He told me to go home and rest, and said he&#39;d have someone from the team come over to keep an eye on things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I left, I had a quick word with the nurse on duty, left my number, and asked them to call me if anything came up with Lally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I got home, it was already 1 AM. I tossed and turned, unable to sleep, thinking about everything that had happened to Lally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Lally wrong? No, she wasn&#39;t. With everything she&#39;d been through, how could she just abandon it all and start fresh?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Duke wrong? Yeah, he was. He shouldn&#39;t have gotten into drugs or done all those bad things. But was it entirely his fault? How much had he suffered over the years?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he was still a child, he could confidently say to Lally, &#34;I&#39;ll take care of you, I&#39;ll support you through school, we won&#39;t leave each other, we&#39;ll rely on each other to survive...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fate had a funny way of messing with people, and it was not always about right or wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought for a moment and opened Facebook. Zoey should be asleep by now, so I left her a message: [Zoey, when you see this tomorrow, please reply. We&#39;re holding off on publishing the report for now. Lally&#39;s situation is really complicated, and a simple anti-drug article won&#39;t do it justice. I&#39;ll explain everything to you in detail tomorrow. Let&#39;s make this the headline article for the monthly magazine.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought of another topic: [Is the orphanage from twenty years ago still around?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just Lally and Duke who faced such tragic fates; there were many unfortunate children, some of whom might have died young. The person in charge of that orphanage needed to be held accountable; we couldn&#39;t simply let it pass!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, Zoey replied right away: [Okay, Mrs. Smith, I&#39;ll hold off and wait for your new content. How&#39;s Lally doing? Are you at the hospital? Have you eaten? Do you want me to bring you something? My mom cooked a lot of food today.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy: [Thanks, I&#39;ve eaten. Lally&#39;s awake and doing okay. I came back for now and will head to the hospital early tomorrow to see her. You should get some rest.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey: [Okay, Mrs. Smith.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled a bit. Zoey is really thoughtful. I felt a warmth in my heart as I touched the blanket she gave me and sent a message: [Zoey.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey: [What&#39;s up, Mrs. Smith?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy: [The blanket is really warm. I love it. Thank you.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey: [Mrs. Smith, good night.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy: [Good night, Zoey.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, I woke up early, got ready, and drove to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lally&#39;s outpouring last night, along with a whole night&#39;s rest, should have helped her recover quite a bit. Today, I wanted to ask her directly about Alan&#39;s case, why she gave false testimony in court, and how much she knew about the truth of the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was because of Alan, but I always felt a pang of sympathy whenever the orphanage came up. Alan didn&#39;t talk much about it, but his childhood there must&#39;ve been rough. For Lally, if she wasn&#39;t too deep in this mess, I&#39;d do everything I could to help her get back on her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been through enough already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first bit of light in her life had turned into a shadow, so I wanted to open a window for her to let in some new sunlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I parked in the hospital garage, didn&#39;t head upstairs right away, and went to the entrance to grab some breakfast for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when I got to her room, it was empty. The bed was neatly made, with some money and a note on top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It read: [Nancy, this is Lally. Thank you for saving me and for listening to my stories last night. Last night was probably the bravest I&#39;ve ever been, facing my past and myself. There are still some things I didn&#39;t talk about. I don&#39;t want to remember them, and I don&#39;t want to hurt you. But it&#39;s all in the past, so it doesn&#39;t matter if I talk about it or not. I checked out this morning and paid the hospital fees. You&#39;ve helped me enough, and I can&#39;t let you spend more money.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly asked the nurse on duty, but she didn&#39;t know much. She said she saw Lally in the room around 6 AM.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked the time; it was 8:30 AM.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t have gone far. I rushed to the security office and described Lally&#39;s height, clothing, and appearance, asking if they&#39;d seen her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security guard said there were too many people coming and going every morning to remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no choice but to call Benjamin for help. &#34;Benjamin, Lally checked out early this morning and left. Can you help me find out where she lives?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did this happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Around 6 AM. I went up at 8:30, so about an hour and a half ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She can&#39;t have gone far. Hold on, I&#39;ll ask a colleague at the registration office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Benjamin called a colleague at the registration office, asking for Lally&#39;s address. The officer said they could only find her address from a few years ago, but that place had been demolished, and they couldn&#39;t find her current address.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly thought of the Entertainment Club. Maybe her colleagues there would know where she lived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin hung up and quickly contacted Billy at the Entertainment Club, asking me to wait for news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, not long after, Benjamin called back with an address near Elm Street in Silverlight City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked the map; it wasn&#39;t far, about a ten-minute drive. I grabbed the breakfast and rushed to the parking lot, driving off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, unlike with Tammy, I quickly found her place following the address. It was an old neighborhood, probably about ten years old, with the highest building being six stories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her address was Unit 3, fourth floor, apartment 402.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked on the door, hoping someone would answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, I heard footsteps inside, and I felt a surge of joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lally opened the door. I glanced inside and saw that she seemed to be packing things. Was she planning to move?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nancy, why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lally&#39;s eyes lit up, then quickly dimmed and she said, &#34;Of course, how could you not find me... Come in.&#34;</p>
