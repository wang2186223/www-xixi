                <p>The doctor&#39;s voice bounced off the empty hallway walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Filled with anger, he wondered why a girl as fragile as a flower had to go through such hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rape, sexual assault, and the most lethal of all, forced drug injections-if this incident were fully exposed, what kind of trauma would it cause to Lally and to society as a whole?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Gonzalez, the victim&#39;s case is confidential and can&#39;t be shared.&#34; Benjamin walked in from the ER corridor and asked, &#34;What&#39;s the status?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed like the doctor, Bruce Gonzalez, and Benjamin knew each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The immediate danger&#39;s over. She&#39;s still out cold, though. They pumped her full of morphine-like drugs. She might wake up in a few hours, or it could take a day. Even when she does wake up, she&#39;ll need to be in the ICU for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let the family know first. If anything changes, it&#39;ll be easier for them to sign the papers. Someone should handle the admission stuff.&#34; Bruce gave a few instructions and then got busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After walking Bruce out a few steps, Benjamin turned back and said, &#34;I&#39;ll take care of the admission stuff in a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has Lally&#39;s family been told?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No family, she&#39;s on her own.&#34; Benjamin pushed open the emergency exit door, lit a cigarette, and said, &#34;While we were looking into Duke, we checked on Lally too. She&#39;s an orphanage kid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Both are the same age, born in &#39;97, high school grads. They&#39;ve been working together for years. Ruben went to the Entertainment Club this afternoon to check things out. Lally&#39;s been there for years, one of the longest employees. Other staff said she&#39;s nice, hardworking, but her boyfriend was bad news. She often had bruises. They told her to dump Duke, but she never did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Benjamin took a deep drag on his cigarette and slowly blew out a thin stream of smoke, &#34;So, it makes sense. Two people leaning on each other, and Duke got hooked on drugs, dragging Lally down with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Wright, about the video of Lally online today...&#34; Zoey, who had been quiet, hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The right people blocked it in time. Until we know more, public opinion will just make things worse and hurt the victim.&#34; Benjamin flicked away the cigarette butt and said, &#34;I&#39;ll have someone from the team come over to watch her. It&#39;s late, you two should head home. You&#39;ve worked hard today, especially you, Zoey. It&#39;s your first big scene as an intern. Go home and get some rest. From the Silverlight City Legal Journal&#39;s perspective, it&#39;s been a productive day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need, Zoey, you go rest first. I&#39;ll stay here tonight,&#34; I said slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Smith, I&#39;ll stay with you.&#34; Zoey quickly refused, tugging my sleeve, &#34;I can write the article here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, you go home first. It&#39;s been a long day, and the article can wait. Just get it to me by tomorrow night. As for the angle...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could finish, Zoey said without hesitation, &#34;Let&#39;s write about Lally this time, from the victim&#39;s perspective, highlighting the dangers of drugs. This will address today&#39;s public opinion and align with the recent anti-drug campaign. I&#39;ll use pseudonyms for her name and background.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; I felt proud. Zoey&#39;s choice of topics was getting better, not because of my guidance, but because of her own talent and hard work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some convincing, Zoey finally left the hospital, glancing back every few steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nancy, I didn&#39;t bring up Alan in front of Zoey. Why are you staying here tonight? Lally&#39;s perjury can be looked into later. It&#39;s the police&#39;s job to protect her. You&#39;ve been here all afternoon; you don&#39;t need to stay another night. Go get some rest. I&#39;ll let you know as soon as she wakes up.&#34; Benjamin frowned and hesitated, &#34;Or, I can have Cindy stay with you for a couple of days. You two were college roommates and get along well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need.&#34; I shook my head and sat on a chair in the hallway, saying, &#34;I&#39;m not staying just to ask a few questions. I want to know why she did it and hear her story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she crouched in the corner, I knew I would never forget it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be so abused, forcibly injected with such a large dose of drugs, she should have completely lost self-awareness from a physiological standpoint. Yet, she still instinctively protected Duke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignorant love wouldn&#39;t have such strong power in the face of life and death. What kind of bond did they share?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, when Benjamin mentioned the orphanage, I suddenly thought of Alan, who also grew up in an orphanage, and felt a natural sense of closeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to stay and watch her wake up, understand the truth behind the perjury, and then help her amend her testimony and live a normal life. This world was too cruel to the unfortunate. And I didn&#39;t want to see her get hurt again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin didn&#39;t say anything more. We went to the ICU together, got a detailed update from the doctor, and soon after, the police station called, and he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved a chair and sat by Lally&#39;s bed. From the last time in court, to this afternoon at the Entertainment Club, to now, this was the third time we met. To be precise, it was the third time I saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The large ICU was empty, just the two of us. Lally lay by the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her, it might be a long-lost peace. This disaster, which might bring a huge change to her future, at least at this moment, allowed her to enjoy a moment of tranquility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was very quiet. Having just escaped from the clutches of death, her breathing was steady and smooth. If I listened closely, I could hear faint breathing sounds. I felt a sense of pity, even thinking it might be better if she stayed asleep. Waking up would mean facing this terrible world again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world had never changed; it was just our perspective that differed, like camera filters showing the same moon in different ways. I used to scoff at this, believing one must eventually come out of illusions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at this moment, I hoped she would sleep a little longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she committed perjury, even if she harbored many secrets, I wasn&#39;t so heartless as to harbor immense hatred for everyone related to my husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lay quietly on the hospital bed, eyes tightly shut, her face as pale as ever. The wound on her forehead was bandaged, and the bruises on her cheeks remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lally was very delicate, simple, youthful, giving a feeling of a gentle breeze, an inexplicable sense of closeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I remembered her last words before she fainted, &#34;Hospital... costs... go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had life done to her? After every hardship, did she go home to lie in bed and endure it alone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was thinking, her eyebrows twitched slightly. She woke up.</p>
