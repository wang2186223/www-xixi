                <p>The streets in Silverlight City were super easy to navigate, laid out in a neat grid with four main avenues shooting out from this massive sculpture smack in the middle of town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sculpture? It was built by Alexander Mitchell, the founding emperor of the Phoenix Dynasty, like, over seven hundred years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>History books paint him as this big-time conqueror who fought a ton of battles and built the biggest empire of his era. Some folks think he&#39;s a legend, but others call him out for offing his own brothers to snag the throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s statue is right in the heart of Silverlight City and it&#39;s a major attraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At night, lights from all over shine on him, making his figure glow like some kind of divine guardian watching over the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The traffic light was taking forever, and Joseph, who hadn&#39;t been around in a while, sat in his car waiting, puffing on a cigarette and eyeing the grand sculpture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rubbed his chin and muttered, &#34;Are you even human? You killed your own brothers who went through hell with you. What else can&#39;t you do? History might be rewritten, but do you ever feel guilty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light finally turned green, and Joseph hit the gas, heading east.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The priciest houses in Silverlight City were out west, in the new commercial area with all the fancy infrastructure and tons of companies. With commercial land competing, residential prices naturally shot up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the real rich folks in Silverlight City lived in the southeast, in the Three Rivers District. It was low-density, super green, and had a beautiful natural environment with villas scattered around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph seemed to know the area well, timing the traffic lights perfectly and not stopping at a single red. Soon, he parked his car in the garage of a villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa wasn&#39;t his; no way a working-class guy could afford it in two lifetimes. It belonged to someone else-Frank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph glanced at the dim light on the second floor, a complex expression crossing his face. He walked up the steps, pressed the fingerprint lock, and the door clicked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned on the foyer light, walked through, and headed to the bar in the spacious living room. He opened the fridge, grabbed a bottle of water, took a few gulps, caught his breath, and lit another cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t bother with the living room chandelier. Some say dim lighting helps with concentration or deep thinking, but those weren&#39;t his reasons. He didn&#39;t need to think about anything. The swirling smoke making his vision blurrier was better; he just didn&#39;t want to see that person too clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve told you a million times, no smoking in my house,&#34; Frank said, slowly coming down the spiral staircase, coughing a few times. &#34;If you die from too much nicotine, that&#39;d be a good thing. At least you wouldn&#39;t have to change your blood every six months and take all those weird chemicals, living like a ghost. Why bother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the smoky, dim light, Joseph could only make out a hunched figure, which was enough for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frank wasn&#39;t mad; he was used to Joseph&#39;s way of talking. But those few steps down the stairs left him sweating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning on the stair railing, he quietly watched Joseph not far away, staring at the flickering cigarette butt and suddenly said, &#34;If I die, can my organs be donated?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Joseph shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34; Frank looked surprised, then chuckled, &#34;I think they still have some research value. Maybe you could study them. If I remember right, you were a whiz at anatomy in college. The professor said you were a rare genius. Shouldn&#39;t be too hard for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because it&#39;s a waste,&#34; Joseph grinned, snuffing out his cigarette and tossing it on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked over, supporting Frank&#39;s arm, carefully helping him lie on the sofa. &#34;You&#39;re half-dead, yet you still come downstairs to greet me. No need to be so stubborn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These years have been tough on you. Out of our group, only you dare to talk to me and Alan like this. The others, they care, but there&#39;s still some reverence. It&#39;s like being the eldest brother, it&#39;s normal to have some.&#34; Frank lay on the sofa, casually pulling a blanket over himself, smiling with a tone full of nostalgia, seemingly longing for the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph said, &#34;They only have reverence for you, not Alan. They only have endless admiration and gratitude for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re saying I&#39;m not as good as him?&#34; A flash of displeasure crossed Frank&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph didn&#39;t respond, looking at the large LCD TV on the living room wall, and softly said, &#34;Stop it. You&#39;re so rich. Before Nancy finds out, leave. Go abroad and enjoy the last part of your life, forget the hatred, and live happily for once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frank&#39;s tone rose a few notches, stiffly turning his neck, coldly staring at Joseph, &#34;Do you think sticking on a fake beard can fool yourself? Do you really think I&#39;m blind and didn&#39;t see it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s face turned pale sharply, glaring at Frank like a castrated wild dog, baring his teeth but not daring to move forward. Even a dying tiger was still a tiger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph asked, &#34;Where are Tony and Lally? What did you say to Tom to make him ignore his own brother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t look at me like that. It&#39;s been this way since we were kids.&#34; Frank shook his head, calmly saying, &#34;I didn&#39;t say anything to Tom. It was his own choice. You don&#39;t understand his feelings for the Thompson family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph stood up abruptly, pointing at Frank and shouting. &#34;What about Lally and Tony? Ask yourself honestly, if Alan hadn&#39;t taken you to the Thompson family&#39;s meals every now and then, would you be alive now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit down! Do you still see me as your elder?&#34; Frank shouted angrily, coughing repeatedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, he said, &#34;Mrs. Thompson is in the hospital, receiving the best treatment. I found the doctor! I added $200,000 to the insurance policy Tony and Tom gave Mrs. Thompson. As for Tony, he overestimated himself, trying to save Lally and that bitch. His life is ruined by women!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only ask you, will you save them or not?&#34; Joseph asked sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To achieve great things, sacrifices must be made,&#34; Frank said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph sneered several times, got up, and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frank didn&#39;t stop him, just watched Joseph&#39;s back, calculating something in his mind. When Joseph reached the foyer, he called out to him, &#34;Did you tip off Nancy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Joseph stopped, not turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I overthought it.&#34; Frank nodded thoughtfully, &#34;Then did you give Nancy Mrs. Thompson&#39;s insurance policy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll say it again, I haven&#39;t seen Nancy.&#34; Joseph sighed, softly saying, &#34;You sent me to court back then just to use me as a pawn, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good.&#34; Frank slowly closed his eyes, whispering to himself, &#34;Yes, someone has to be sacrificed.&#34;</p>
