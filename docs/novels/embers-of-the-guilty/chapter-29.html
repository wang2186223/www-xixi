                <p>My car trailed behind Benjamin&#39;s as we rolled up to the Entertainment Club. From a distance, I spotted a guy in a suit waving at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This dude looked to be around forty, bald, a bit chubby, short, with tiny eyes, a big nose, and a face plastered with a smile. This had to be the club manager Benjamin mentioned, the witness who did not appear at the first trial. His surname was apparently Lopez.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we parked, Billy Lopez came hustling over with a few bottles of water, grinning and handing them out to the four of us, trying way too hard to be nice. But when he got to Tanner, his face twisted with anger, and he spat out, &#34;You lowlife, I got you now! You almost cost me my job. If the cops weren&#39;t here, I&#39;d beat you to death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tanner just stared at the ground, not reacting at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Lopez, we&#39;re on duty. Take the water back,&#34; Benjamin said, cool as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Wright, don&#39;t be so formal. You and Mr. Adams are my heroes! You caught Tanner, and if you hadn&#39;t, the club would&#39;ve shut down, and my boss would&#39;ve fired me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Billy, all puffed up with self-righteousness, patted his belly and said, &#34;I&#39;m not an ungrateful guy. Mr. Wright, you are a big deal, serving the people, fighting for justice, eradicating evil. But I&#39;m just a regular guy. My wife said we should give you a banner that says &#39;Lifesaver.&#39; Even though we&#39;ve only met once, your image in my mind is exceptionally grand. I thought about it all night and couldn&#39;t sleep. This morning, I had an idea! Police and civilians in harmony, today we show our gratitude to you with harmony!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flashed his phone, showing a payment record, and said, &#34;Mr. Wright, don&#39;t worry, this isn&#39;t public money. I paid for this water myself. If your bosses give you trouble, I&#39;ll show them the receipt and clear your name...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, let&#39;s cut to the chase,&#34; Ruben interrupted, clearly fed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey leaned over and whispered to me, &#34;Mrs. Smith, this manager can really talk. Just four bottles of water, and he spins it into being a lifesaver and police-civilian harmony. No wonder he&#39;s a manager.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. This guy wasn&#39;t simple. He said a lot, but it was all to buy time. While he was talking, he was checking everyone out, especially glancing at Zoey and me a few times, probably pegging us as reporters, so he was being careful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Lopez, let&#39;s skip the small talk. I already told you why we&#39;re here on the phone. Has the person who bought drugs from Tanner shown up?&#34; Ruben asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Adams, keep it down. I&#39;m risking my neck to help you!&#34; Billy nervously glanced around and whispered, &#34;He&#39;s here, in a private room on the third floor. The waiters are keeping an eye on him. If anything happens, they&#39;ll call me right away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Wright, should we head up now or...?&#34; Ruben nudged Benjamin for his take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin seemed lost in thought, his eyes fixed on a nearby food stall called &#39;Ronald Food Truck.&#39; I remembered chatting with the owner when I was investigating the Entertainment Club a few days ago. The owner had mentioned that the club was suspected of organizing prostitution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Lopez, how long has that stall been there?&#34; Benjamin asked, pointing to the diner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Over two years. Our night shift guys eat there at noon! Is that guy a criminal too?&#34; Billy squinted at the stall, looking annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is that possible? He looks like someone from my village. I&#39;m telling you, this guy is a good person, making money isn&#39;t easy, don&#39;t disturb his business!&#34; Benjamin instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, this is practically our company&#39;s cafeteria. The food is good, portions are generous, and prices are fair. I knew he couldn&#39;t be a criminal!&#34; Billy quickly changed his tune, nodding eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Someone from the village? Clearly lying. Cindy said Benjamin&#39;s family is from Silverlight City, how could he recognize someone from a village?&#39; I glanced at Benjamin, who shook his head slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tanner, I&#39;m gonna unlock your cuffs. Don&#39;t worry about your mom, I&#39;ll keep it from her. Cooperate well, and this will count as a contribution, you&#39;ll get leniency. I keep my word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin gave Tanner a serious look, took out his phone, dialed a number, put it on speaker, and held it to his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few rings, someone answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man&#39;s voice came from the other end, &#34;Hello, Mr. Green?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn, Duke Hill, where are you? Have you arrived?&#34; Tanner shouted, apparently their usual way of greeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here, at True Love Entertainment Club. Where are you? Hurry up, I can&#39;t wait!&#34; The person named Duke on the other end said, with a girl&#39;s crying in the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all looked at Billy, who innocently waved his hands, showing his phone to indicate he hadn&#39;t received any messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin gave Tanner a look, and Tanner nodded, continuing, &#34;You&#39;re lying. I hear a woman crying. Where are you? Are you with the police? Fuck you, I&#39;d be an idiot to give you more goods!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way! If I&#39;m ever be with the police, I swear I&#39;ll die a miserable death. I&#39;m disciplining my wife, a born whore, a prostitute, cheating on me. I&#39;ll beat her to death!&#34; Duke shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was the sound of hitting and cursing on the phone. The girl&#39;s voice sounded familiar, but I couldn&#39;t place it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tanner&#39;s eyes filled with anger, and he shouted, &#34;Not a word of truth from you. You said you&#39;d only get goods from me, but I haven&#39;t seen you in over a month. I thought you overdosed. Tell me who stole my business, or I won&#39;t give you any goods!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tanner glanced at Benjamin, who nodded, signaling him to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that Tanner wouldn&#39;t give him any goods, Duke panicked. &#34;Mr. Green, I&#39;m sorry, it was Paul Baker. Paul said not to get from you, his is cheaper. You have to give me some, I&#39;m out after today.&#34;</p>
