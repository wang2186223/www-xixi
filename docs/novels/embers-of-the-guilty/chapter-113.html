                <p>&#34;Then go to Frank&#39;s house quickly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally heard the exact whereabouts of Alan. He was not dead; he was under Frank&#39;s control. It felt like the tension in my heart was about to snap, a piercing pain that made me lose my sanity, and I shouted into the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nancy, it&#39;s crucial to stay patient at times like this. We&#39;re investigating Frank. As I mentioned earlier, we searched his house thoroughly yesterday, even using sonic detectors and life detectors to check hidden rooms, but we found nothing. I don&#39;t think Frank would keep Alan at his house. You might want to ask Bob again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember, be safe! You must stay safe!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Leonard hung up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at Bob, seriously saying,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no patience left. Tell me, are you still in contact with Frank?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob shook his head, &#34;No more phone calls.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be responsible for your words and actions. What you say now could lead to a wrong judgment. We were college classmates, and you and Alan have been through life and death together. I don&#39;t want any more accidents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed deeply, feeling lost. My eyes inexplicably hot after blinking, tears started to fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alan&#39;s whereabouts had thrown me into turmoil, and then there was the news of Mike&#39;s murder. Among our college friends, Mike was the most honest and straightforward. He would blush to his ears when talking to girls. He was steady, and diligent, and always dreamed of becoming a teacher after graduation, living a stable life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was sensitive and cautious, always carrying a hearing aid due to congenital hearing loss. To look normal, he followed the trend, wearing an earphone in one ear and hiding the hearing aid&#39;s main unit in his pants pocket, looking like a boy listening to music. Thinking back, the congenital hearing loss might have been a lie, probably due to abuse at the old steel mill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was kind-hearted and compassionate. Among college boys, his tear ducts were more active than girls&#39;. He couldn&#39;t bear sad stories or see classmates in trouble. He had little money, relying on part-time jobs during vacations and school grants. Whenever he heard about school donations, he would cry and donate a few hundred dollars, leaving just enough for his meals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever I had a fight with Alan, he would find me on the playground, bringing a cup of juice, quietly placing it beside me, sitting with me for a long time, and softly saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alan said he knows he was wrong. Do you want to forgive him, or can you two not make me the middleman next time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the boy who liked wearing plaid shirts, and faded jeans, thin and clean, had left this world, dying yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, the sun rose and set as usual, and the world remained unchanged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mike was murdered last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bob, what else are you hiding from me? You need to tell me. Lally is missing, Tony is missing, and now Mike is dead. I don&#39;t want you to be next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down my face as I shook the despondent Bob&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Bob hoarsely said,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;ll tell you... That day, we planned to kill not only Douglas but also...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the hospital room door was flung open!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley rushed in, seemingly having kicked something. Looking down, it was a packed dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly remembered, why hadn&#39;t Zoey come back yet?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left the dinner at the door without coming in; she must have heard something!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn! She knew about Ronald&#39;s identity!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bob! Something&#39;s wrong! Someone from the first floor just called, the house is on fire!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley shouted!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob jumped out of bed and rushed out the door!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things got worse! Cedric from the old steel mill was still at the house!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house was fine in the afternoon, and there were no flammable or explosive materials stored around. How could it suddenly catch fire?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally understood it wasn&#39;t Frank who killed Mike, it was Ronald!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Leonard mentioned on the phone that it was a police gun. I thought it was a framing trick, but Ronald used a police gun to shoot!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This man was completely insane!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killing Cedric from the old steel mill was understandable, but why killed Mike?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t think too much, quickly following Bob and Shirley, and calling Zoey, but no one answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, my heart was in complete chaos. I had no idea what foolish thing Zoey might do next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Zoey, don&#39;t do anything foolish. No matter what happens, I&#39;m here for you. You&#39;re not just my apprentice; I&#39;ve always seen you as a little sister. Zoey, be good, call me back. It&#39;s dangerous outside. Even if you just send a message, I&#39;m worried about you!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sending the message, I had already reached the hospital&#39;s ground floor. Bob and Shirley had hailed a cab. Just then, another cab came by, and I quickly flagged it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Follow that car in front, catch up with them! Wherever they go, we go. You can keep the extra money, and if it&#39;s not enough, I&#39;ll make up for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, throwing the driver $100. The driver didn&#39;t ask anything, it was late at night, and there were few cars in town. He stepped on the gas, speeding toward Bob and Shirley&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the ride, Zoey still hadn&#39;t replied. I couldn&#39;t wait any longer and called Howard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Howard, I&#39;m sorry, Zoey found out about Ronald. She&#39;s missing now, and I can&#39;t reach her. Do you have any connections in Shadow City? Please ask someone to find her. Ronald is crazy. He killed Mike yesterday and came to Shadow City today to kill the witness from the old steel mill who has evidence of his crimes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay, now&#39;s not the time for self-blame. Zoey would have found out sooner or later. I guess Zoey went to find Ronald. Wherever Ronald is, Zoey will be there. Find Ronald, and you&#39;ll find Zoey!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard&#39;s voice was steady, but he was starting to speak incoherently, trying to stay calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Zoey went to find Ronald, which was good. Ronald must be near Bob&#39;s house, maybe even inside, preparing to kill Cedric!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant Zoey hadn&#39;t been gone long, at least since hearing about Mike&#39;s murder, she immediately thought the killer was Ronald and went to Bob&#39;s house first!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll find her!&#34;</p>
