                <p>I had played out a million ways meeting Tony could go down, and I even had this gut feeling he was dodging me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I never thought he&#39;d spot me right away. And from the way he acted all cool, it was clear he knew I&#39;d been tailing him that morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was totally thrown off by this sudden address and all the info that came with it. She looked a bit rattled but quickly pulled herself together, smiled, glanced at me, and figured it was best if I took the lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Tony, nice to meet you. I&#39;m Nancy Johnson,&#34; I said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a ton of questions swirling in my head, but with this face-to-face, I didn&#39;t even know where to start. Since he already knew I was onto him, might as well just lay it all out there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t seem like the best time to chat,&#34; I said, eyeing Tony in his work uniform and pointing to the seat across from us. &#34;The service here at Stardust Diner is top-notch. Why don&#39;t you take a break and join us for a bit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony shrugged and gave a wry smile, &#34;If you want to see me get canned, Mrs. Smith, go ahead. Jobs are hard to come by these days. If I can&#39;t bring home a paycheck, you&#39;ve met my wife, her temper&#39;s no joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, he knew I had met Anna, which meant he was aware I was digging into his life. But how did he recognize me? My business card didn&#39;t have a photo, and the company website had my profile but no picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t tell Anna you&#39;re slacking,&#34; I said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony let out a sigh of relief, patted his chest, and shook his head, &#34;Toby&#39;s never wrong. Mrs. Smith, you&#39;re a good person. Just order the food for now. If it&#39;s not enough, call me anytime. I get off work at 10 PM, but I guess you can&#39;t wait that long. I&#39;ll take a break around 6 PM, and we can find a nearby café to chat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No rush, I&#39;ll wait until you&#39;re off,&#34; I gently declined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since he came to find me, it meant he wasn&#39;t going to hide anymore. No need to rush. His life wasn&#39;t easy, and taking a break would mean a pay cut. How much could a Stardust Diner waiter make in a month anyway?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Smith, you&#39;re too kind. It&#39;s fine, I have a lot to talk to you about.&#34; Tony grabbed the iPad and hurried off to serve other customers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey let out a long breath after he walked away, took a few gulps of coffee, and kept saying, &#34;That freaked me out. Mrs. Smith, you&#39;re so calm. When he called you Mrs. Smith, I was stunned. I was trying to think of a way to stall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, stop flattering me. And by the way, your acting skills still need some work... I saw through you right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way, Mrs. Smith, you&#39;re the best!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey must had noticed that I also got flustered just now. After Tony left, she tried to lighten the mood. But Zoey was too over the top. Where did she pick up this workplace experience?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t hold it in earlier, and there was no need to hide it in front of Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winter in Silverlight City was freezing, and the glass windows were fogged up from the warmth inside the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the waiter brought the hot pot and dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey also ordered an extra iced cola. Ice cream, iced coffee, iced cola-Zoey was happily munching and humming, not forgetting to give me some food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In winter, drinking so many cold things and eating Mexican food, be careful of stomach issues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I poured Zoey a cup of hot milk, which I had specially requested from the waiter earlier. Mainly because I couldn&#39;t stand the overly enthusiastic service at Stardust Diner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t really care about what you needed; they just put on this big show of being super enthusiastic and caring. That fake concern was something I could definitely do without.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was munching away, her mouth all greasy, and she mumbled, &#34;Mrs. Smith, if you don&#39;t drink iced Starbucks coffee, it&#39;s like drinking bad medicine. And don&#39;t Thalassia people do this? Wearing coats in winter and holding iced coffee. Thalassia male celebrities are pretty hot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her so happy with her food, my mood lifted. It was like watching my little sister eat. I teased her, &#34;Weren&#39;t you into Vesperia-style guys? When did it switch to Thalassia-style? Let me think, right, Benjamin&#39;s apprentice Ruben might not be your dream guy, but if he tries hard to nail that Thalassia look, there&#39;s still hope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way, Mrs. Smith, I&#39;ll stick to hot drinks,&#34; Zoey pouted and made a face. &#34;I think Ruben should ditch being a detective and get into making funny videos. He&#39;s a natural. Haha, thinking about that day still cracks me up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Talking about Ruben reminded me of how Benjamin left him with me before he took off, saying I could ask him for anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, I added him on Facebook, and he messaged me three times a day: [Mrs. Smith, remember to call me if you need anything. Mrs. Smith, anything you need today? Mrs. Smith, do you need my help?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey and I were chowing down on Mexican food while chatting about Tony. I gave her the lowdown on Tony&#39;s situation, including his relationship with Anna and her affairs on the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was floored, her eyes wide open. &#34;This is like a tragic second male lead in a novel. My God, there are really people this unlucky in real life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you say that?&#34; I didn&#39;t read romance novels much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In those novels, the main guy has it easy, while the second male lead&#39;s life is a mess. Betrayed by lovers, ditched by friends, all alone, and it usually ends badly for them. They either turn evil or end up dead.&#34; Zoey thought for a moment and summed up the plot of those stories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life was more vivid and wild than stories. Based on what I knew about Tony, Zoey&#39;s take made some sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, in the early stages of the story, what keeps him going through all the bad stuff?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two things.&#34; Zoey held up two fingers, not forgetting to take a bite of ice cream. &#34;Emotions and hatred. Usually, these two are all mixed up. When someone&#39;s mental world falls apart, they go bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she was talking, we suddenly heard someone singing a birthday song not far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony was leading two waiters, singing with gusto. A couple was celebrating their kid&#39;s birthday at Stardust Diner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other two were half-heartedly dancing, but Tony was all in, singing and dancing with tons of energy, which seemed different from the Tony I had just met or heard about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was beaming, occasionally interacting with the kid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anyone else saw this, they&#39;d think this Stardust Diner waiter had an amazing work attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But knowing his story, I had a feeling he was actually savoring this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was regret or some form of self-compensation.</p>
