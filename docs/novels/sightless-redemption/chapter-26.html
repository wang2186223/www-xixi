                <p>Alessandro&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Mancini is alright. She&#39;s got a concussion, a broken arm, and bruises from the fall. I am going to keep her overnight to keep a close eye on her. She was incredibly fortunate that it turned out to be only a concussion and not something more severe. Considering the distance she fell down the stairs, one would expect greater harm, yet miraculously, she shielded her head from hitting the stairs, resulting in a broken arm instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor informed me, &#34;O, and one last thing, are you abusing your wife, Mr. Mancini? I found a large bruise on her arm; it looks like someone grabbed her and pressed very tight&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, doctor, and to answer your question, no, I don&#39;t abuse my wife, but I will find out who did it to her,&#34; I tell the doctor in a stern voice. The doctor tells us where Lisa&#39;s room is, and just as Antonio wants to walk to Lisa, Johnny, Jake, and Kevin come up to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We heard what happened, man. Will Lisa be okay? Johnny asks worriedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, the doctor says she has a concussion; he wants to keep her here for the night. I was just on my way to her&#34;. I told them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will go with you&#34;, Kevin tells me. All of us went to Lisa&#39;s room. Once inside, I don&#39;t hear anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assume she is asleep?&#34;, I ask them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, she is. What happened because she got bruises on her face and her arm is in a cast?&#34; Jake wants to know, with anger clear in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and tell them about Bianca. &#34;Are you fucking crazy? Why don&#39;t you just send the bitch away?&#34; A very angry Johnny wants to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, guys. I mean, I love her, but I want to punish her&#34;, I told them truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are a fucking idiot, I tell you; Bianca is responsible for this; if she is, I am going to slowly kill her for hurting my sister&#34;, Kevin says with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca was with me the whole time; she couldn&#39;t have done it. Don&#39;t you dare lay a finger on her,&#34; I say in a cold voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, she still has you under her spell. But you keep on entertaining her. The rest of us will find out what happened,&#34; Jake said with disgust in his voice. Just then, the doctor comes in and says. &#34;Mr. Mancini, if everything goes well, we will discharge Mrs. Mancini. needs to rest for at least a week or two. If she feels dizzy or vomits, you must bring her in asap. The cast will be on for at least eight weeks; after that, I will remove it and check if her arm has healed. I will prescribe the medicine she needs to take. Any other questions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, thank you, doctor,&#34; I reply. The five of us spent a few more minutes with Lisa when the nurse came to tell us that we must leave. When we got out of the hospital, I heard Bianca&#39;s. &#34;Is Lisa okay, my poor baby?&#34; Bianca asks sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this plastic doll doing here?&#34; Kevin asks with disgust clear in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me, are you talking to me? I am here to support Alessandro, right, baby?&#34; Bianca says it in a high-pitched voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear the guy&#39;s snorts, and I say to Bianca in a hard voice, &#34;I think you better leave. I told you before I only let family close to us, Bianca&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why am I not family, but these three are?&#34;, she asks in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, duh, Barbie, Lisa is our sister from another mister; do you have a problem with that?&#34; Kevin asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;UGG, please, she is just using all of you, are you that blind&#34;, Bianca asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jake angrily replied, &#34;No, she married Alessandro because she values him for who he is, not for his wealth and social standing. Unlike you, she knows how to truly enjoy life instead of constantly wasting money on shopping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is enough, Bianca. I won&#39;t say it again. Leave!&#34; I yell. Bianca stomps her feet, and knowing her, she is probably sulking like a three-year-old who didn&#39;t get her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny makes a phone call to his men, &#34;I want people outside Mrs. Mancini&#39;s hospital room this instant. If something happens to her, they will never find your body&#34;, Johnny tells the person on the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the Mansion, Lilani ran up to me and the guys. &#34;Ali, you&#39;re back. Where&#39;s my sister?&#34; Lilani wants to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, little one. Your sister is alright; she needs to stay in the hospital for today, but she will be home tomorrow morning, I promise,&#34; I assure Lilani.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to her&#34;? Lilani asks with fear in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She fell from the stairs, but she&#39;s going to be okay; it&#39;s just a broken arm,&#34; I tell her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ali, can you promise me?&#34; Lilani tearfully asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise you, little one&#34;. I told her softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, guys. What are you doing?&#34; She asks them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We came to visit you guys&#34;, Kevin says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O really?&#34; Lilani says, &#34;I missed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, we missed you too, princess&#34;, Johnny tells her. Maria came in and asked if she could speak to me for a minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod, and she leads me to the office. &#34;What is the problema, Maria?&#34; I asked her. &#34;Signor Mancini, I saw what happened to Mrs. Mancini. You see, I was busy in one of the guest rooms when I heard yelling, so I went closer to the door to listen.&#34; Maria says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tells me everything she has witnessed. &#34;Grazie, Maria, I will attend to this matter immediately.&#34; I tell her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you call Johnny and the guys for me, please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mr. Mancini.&#34; With that, Maria walks out. I run my hands through my hair. I fucking can&#39;t believe it; I should have never sent Lisa with that bastard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is my fault as well. Just then the door opens and Kevin speaks, &#34;You called us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Maria told me what happened. I want you guys to track down Donatello Costa for me and bring him to me. He wanted to kidnap Lisa for Bianca&#39;s father, but decided to keep her for himself. She struggled against him, and once she was free, she ran down the stairs, but he followed her and pushed her. He&#39;s going to pay for what he did to MY WIFE!&#34; I told them angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are on it; we will find him, I promise&#34;. Jake says, and I can imagine his smirking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will come as soon as we find him&#34;, Kevin says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to do it in three days; I am going away for a while in three days&#34;, I tell them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, are you taking Lisa on a honeymoon?&#34; Kevin asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, she doesn&#39;t know yet. I want to keep it a secret. I&#39;m getting an eye operation on Thursday. I want you guys to look after my family while I&#39;m gone.&#34; I finally told them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, I hope all goes well, bro, and don&#39;t worry, we will come and stay here till you get back; your family is safe with us,&#34; Johnny says. Jake and the rest want to know about the operation, I tell them everything, and after telling them, the guys leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ask Lilani if she wants to visit her sister after dinner is finished. Lilani said yes, and we went to the hospital. On our arrival, Lisa was awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa, I miss you&#34;, Lilani cried out, probably noticing all the bruises on her sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here, princess; I am fine; I promise; please don&#39;t cry&#34;, Lisa comforts her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Alessandro. How are you? Thank you, for bringing Lilani with you.&#34; She says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem. I&#39;m okay I guess. I heard what happened. I&#39;m sorry for sending you with him&#34;, I say softly as I sit next to her holding her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright; you didn&#39;t know this would happen, and I am alright. But how did you find out?&#34; She asks me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maria was in one of the guest rooms; she listened to everything; she came to me and told me everything&#34;, I explained to her. We chat for a while longer until we are asked to leave. Lisa kissed Lilani good bey and I did something that shocked Lisa and probably poor Antonio, I bent down and kissed Lisa full on her lips. I bit her bottom lips softly, and Lisa gasped, then I slid my tongue inside. We kissed for a while, then pulled apart when we heard Lilani giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rest my head against Lisa&#39;s head and whisper, &#34;Sweet dreams, love; I will come and get you tomorrow&#34;, I can feel Lisa smile against my fingers, and she bids us good night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was busy in my office when Antonio handed me the phone, saying it was Johnny. &#34;We got him; he is in Greece, Kevin is on his way as we speak. They will be back tomorrow&#34;, Johnny tells me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good job; thank you, Johnny. Take him to a warehouse, and then come and get me&#34;, I inform him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirk, thinking that tomorrow Donatello will never see another day of light again.</p>
