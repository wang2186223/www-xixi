                <p>Alessandro&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lying in the hospital bed, my eyes covered with bandages, I silently pray for the success of the operation, hoping that I will regain my sight. I think about Bianca, and realize she&#39;s just after my money and that she doesn&#39;t love me, maybe it was God sent for our engagement that was canceled and that I met Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everybody says she is the most beautiful woman they have ever seen, maybe I won&#39;t think she&#39;s attractive, not everybody has the same taste. She has a beautiful voice and a beautiful personality, but I want more in a woman than just that. We are married for almost five months, and I still don&#39;t know what my wife looks like, but if everything goes well I will get to see her very soon. I got so much time to think about my past and future, I realize I need to get my life in order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m not getting any younger and want a child of my own. Antonio visits me every day to help me wash and shave. They are satisfied with the treatment I receive in the hospital. A week after my operation Antonio received a file and said he did not recognize the handwriting and opened the file. What he saw in there I don&#39;t know, but he quickly phoned Johnny and informed him about the photos he received. I tried to find out what was going on, but Antonio said it was nothing to worry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I enjoy Sophia&#39;s and the guys&#39; company, but the house is not the same without Alessandro. I accompanied Sophia to her sonar appointment and my heart skipped a beat when I heard the beautiful sound of a heartbeat. It&#39;s simply astonishing to think that a precious little life is growing inside Sophia. Lilani has been doing well with chemo, and it seems like there&#39;s no trace of the tumor, and I feel relieved. The guys always find a way to keep me busy whenever they see me sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Third-person POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny received the photos Antonio sent him and called Kevin and Jake to meet him. They realize Bianca&#39;s father is behind it and start to take matters into their own hands. By the end of the week, the Lombardi&#39;s lost most of their hotels and casinos. Johnny orders his men to hit Lombardi&#39;s brothels. Mr. Lombardi began to panic when he realized he had lost most of his assets. It can&#39;t be Alessandro, he thinks because one of his informants told him Alessandro still has bandages on his eyes. He needs to find out who is behind this and make them pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Antonio and Leonardo both helped with the Mancini business. Most of the important business they left for Alessandro. They went to one meeting after the other and told investors that Mr. Mancini is still in hospital and will soon resume his work. Alessandro is very grateful for his loyal employees that he decides to give them a salary rise as soon as he gets out of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night before the bandages are to be taken off, Alessandro can&#39;t control his excitement. That would be the best day of his life if he can see it again. He can&#39;t wait to see Lisa with his own eyes. This has become an obsession with him these past few days. Antonio and Leonardo did their best to describe her to him, but he just couldn&#39;t get an image of her. Alessandro couldn&#39;t fall asleep that night, then one of the nurses came and gave him a sleeping pill. After drinking the pill he fell asleep immediately and overslept the next morning when one of the nurses came to wake him up for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your sleeping pills surely knock a guy out cold&#34;, he told the nurse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it&#39;s a sin to oversleep on such an important day, Mr. Mancini&#34;, the nurse teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the doctor will be glad to hear you got a good night&#39;s sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why would he be glad?&#34; Alessandro wants to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not good to be tense and a good night&#39;s rest usually makes you feel calm and relaxed the next day&#34;, the nurse explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that you have explained all of this to me, maybe you can tell me how late these bandages will come off.&#34; Alessandro wants to know. On one side he feels excited about the bandages to come off, so he can know if the operation was a success, but on the other side, he feels nervous because what if the operation weren&#39;t a success. Then he hears the nurse say, &#34;The doctor mentioned just after breakfast, Mr. Mancini. That&#39;s why I came in to wake you up so that you will be ready when the doctor comes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro is feeling quite tense as he sits down to eat his breakfast. He realizes how people feel when they wait for their sentence because there will be a sentence over him soon. If this operation, which he wholeheartedly hoped for, is a failure, he might as well be dead. Life will never be the same if he can&#39;t see again. He can&#39;t think it will be worth it to have a wife and kids if he can&#39;t even see what they look like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I have to say you look depressed this morning.&#34; Alessandro is greeted by the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry if I look depressed this morning; maybe a little tense, but not depressed&#34;, he answers with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assume you will take the bandages off, doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As soon as the nurse switched the lights off and closed the blinds, we can&#39;t risk your eyes with so much light just yet. You still need to wear your sunglasses for a while longer.&#34; The doctor explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem positive that I will be able to see again, doctor&#34;, Alessandro says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a lot of confidence in my work, Mr. Mancini. Especially if the patient is as healthy as you.&#34; The doctor says this with a laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But we will soon find out if it was a success; just don&#39;t be depressed or tense if you can&#39;t see immediately; it takes a few seconds.&#34; They wait for a while longer. Then the nurse tells them the room is ready. Alessandro feels how the bandages are taken off his eyes, and then he hears the doctor say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can switch the lights off, miss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last bandage is removed, and then Alessandro slowly opens his eyes, but everything is still dark around him. He was just about to tell the doctor that the operation had failed when he heard the doctor say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can switch the lights on&#34;. He hears how the nurse switches the lights on and the doctor&#39;s voice: &#34;The light is on the opposite side of you against the wall. Just watch in front of you; don&#39;t worry, it takes a while&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, doctor.&#34; Alessandro smiles in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can see a faint light on the wall&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are right, Mr. Alessandro, the light is faint. Your eyes can&#39;t be exposed to sharp light just now; that&#39;s why we will put the bandages back on.&#34; The doctor says</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When will the bandages be taken off?&#34; Alessandro eagerly asks. To his disappointment, he hears the doctor say, &#34;In one week, Mr. Mancini. You must be here in the hospital for at least a week to be taken care of; after that, you will have to wear a special set of glasses for a while&#34;. The nurse noticed the disappointment in Alessandro&#39;s expression and acknowledged it, saying, &#34;I can see that you are feeling disappointed, but please understand that the treatment you will undergo in the upcoming week is crucial for the health of your eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am fully aware of that,&#34; Alessandro says in a composed manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My wife doesn&#39;t know about this operation; I want to surprise her&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know you were married, Mr. Mancini.&#34; The doctor smiles, glad that the operation was a success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, doctor, it has been nearly five months now.&#34; Alessandro smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I think it&#39;s going to be a huge moment in both of your lives when you tell her the good news&#34;, the doctor says, then turns to the nurse and says, &#34;You can open the blinds now, miss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Antonio and Leonardo are happy that Mr. Mancini&#39;s operation was a success. But Alessandro asks them not to tell anyone until he tells Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think Lisa should be the first one to know&#34;, he explains to the pair. &#34;I will leave the day I come out of the hospital, then I will get to see her myself and see if she is as beautiful as you say she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you&#39;re in for a surprise, Mr. Mancini,&#34; Antonio says with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No offense, but I saw a lot of your girlfriends, and none of them are as beautiful as Mrs. Mancini. You can ask Leonardo; he will confirm it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, I believe that she is the most beautiful girl for you,&#34; Alessandro smiles. &#34;The question is, will she be beautiful for me as well? Everyone&#39;s taste is different, Antonio. She may be ugly for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, Mr. Mancini,&#34; Antonio counters assertively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leonardo and I have worked for you a long time, and we never saw you with an ugly girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro&#39;s laugh put a stop to Antonio&#39;s conversation. &#34;It&#39;s true,&#34; Alessandro says as soon as his laughter ends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The three of us have come a long way, Antonio. You should know my taste in women by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Antonio feels relieved that he phoned Johnny about the photos; otherwise, Alessandro would have surely killed Lisa and Kevin by now. He knows Lisa will never do such a thing, and Kevin also won&#39;t betray his friend like that, but he knows Alessandro well enough to know he will have someone&#39;s head. As soon as he&#39;s well, he will tell Alessandro the truth. He just hopes that Johnny finds out who sent those pictures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days go by very slowly for Alessandro. He can&#39;t wait for the day he can be discharged and go back to Lisa. He thinks of all the small things Lisa usually does for him, her beautiful voice whenever she reads to him, her small, soft hands in his when they go for a walk, her laughter. All of these memories make his heart feel warm and beat fast.</p>
