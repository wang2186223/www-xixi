                <p>A few months after her funeral, everything seemed lifeless for him. The house felt empty without Lisa&#39;s presence. Alessandro could smell her everywhere and still can. In the kitchen and their bedroom. The pillows cover everything smells of Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that day he saw the SUV outside the graveyard he phoned Johnny to tell him, but Johnny just told him he imagines that he was seeing things. Maybe he&#39;s right he needs to focus on the children instead of making assumptions about who visits the graveyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro sits in his office looking outside from where he can see Rome. What is life if you lost the one person who made life worth living?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Mancini?&#34; He slowly turns around and looks at Leonardo. He has been quieter than ever. It&#39;s starting to worry the people close to him. Alessandro has been walking around the house and office like a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; Alessandro replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been three months, Sir, and we are worried about you. You must...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s been three months since she&#39;s gone. I&#39;m a body without a soul. I can&#39;t do this any more Leonardo.&#34; Alessandro tells him truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, if I may suggest. why don&#39;t you go and see a counselor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine Leonardo, tell me what&#39;s on the schedule today?&#34; He suddenly changed the subject. He doesn&#39;t want to go to a counselor just to hear he must let go of Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you have a meeting with Mr. Samuel at 2 pm today and Mr. Kevin wants to meet with you as soon as you are free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Leonardo.&#34; He nods his head and walks out. Alessandro was busy typing on his computer when there was a knock on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Mancini, I&#39;m sorry to interrupt you but, Mr. Samuel is on the phone. He wants to talk to you. He says it&#39;s urgent.&#34; Alessandro nods and picks the phone up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Samuel?&#34; Alessandro says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Mancini. There has been a problem here at the company. I thought we could reschedule the meeting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just give my assistant Leonardo the details,&#34; Alessandro told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. Are you okay? You sound tired.&#34; Mr. Samuel tells him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am good. No worries.&#34; Alessandro says. He&#39;s starting to get annoyed with everyone asking him the same question over and over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok if you say so. Remember my daughter? I can introduce the two of you. See you at the meeting.&#34; Samuel says. Alessandro ends the call without saying goodbye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nerve of that man. Nobody will ever replace Lisa. He won&#39;t let it happen. Lisa may be gone, but he doesn&#39;t want someone else. Nobody can replace her. Nobody can erase her memories of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>5 O&#39;clock came by quickly without Alessandro realizing it. Alessandro closes everything and heads out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leonardo you guys can go I&#39;m going to meet Kevin,&#34; Alessandro informs him. His drive to the bar where he&#39;s meeting Kevin was quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, Alessandro.&#34; She says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I love you too. I can&#39;t wait to meet the babies.&#34; Alessandro says rubbing her swollen belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m getting fat by the day,&#34; Lisa complains while watching herself in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you look pregnant and sexy,&#34; Alessandro assures her and holds her from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t think I&#39;m fat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope, you look sexy. I think pregnancy looks damn hot on you.&#34; Alessandro tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too&#34;. Lisa says turning around and kissed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro had tears in his eyes. He can&#39;t stop thinking about Lisa. Fuck! Kevin will start to get worried if he sees him crying. He gets out of the car and walks into the bar where Kevin is waiting for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you, man? Can I get you something to drink?&#34; Kevin greets him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doing great, yeah the usual,&#34; Alessandro says. Kevin calls the waiter and orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, what is it you want to see me so urgently about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Straight to the point. Well, first I want to know if you heard or seen Bianca in the last three months?&#34; Kevin asks seriously. Alessandro frowns, &#34;No nothing. Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin looks his friend in the eyes. &#34;Lisa is dead but not dead. If you know what I mean.&#34; Kevin drops the bombshell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean she&#39;s dead but not dead?&#34; He asks shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it&#39;s a very long story. Short version. Lisa is not dead, she&#39;s got memory loss but is doing just fine....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you talking about Kevin? I held her in my arms the day of the accident. I was there when they buried her.&#34; Alessandro angrily says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, um.... about that. I was getting to the point when you interrupted. The girl you held and buried is not Lisa. She&#39;s a John Doe. I found the body of a woman at the mortuary and got help to make her look exactly like Lisa.&#34; Kevin says letting it all sink in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Why are you telling me all of this? Why now?&#34; Alessandro demands smashing his fist onto the table. Kevin sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I found out Bianca wants Lisa dead. She hired an assassin to take her out. Well, the &#34;assassin&#34; is one of my most trusted men.&#34; Kevin tells Alessandro everything watching his friend&#39;s face go pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re telling me for three months you knew she&#39;s alive but decided to keep it to yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I needed to find Bianca. She&#39;s still out there somewhere. I think she knows Lisa is still alive.&#34; Alessandro shakes his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe what you&#39;re telling me. Why didn&#39;t you come to us and ask for help?&#34; Alessandro demands. He&#39;s angry and hurt that his best friend knew him all along and kept quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As I told you, Bianca is determined to take revenge on all of us starting with you. She wanted to kill Lisa and the boys.&#34; Alessandro listens as his friend explains everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca will pay for what she did. Where is Lisa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s safe in Los Angeles that&#39;s all you have to know for now,&#34; Kevin assured his friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to see her,&#34; Alessandro asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, not yet at least not until we find Bianca and whoever it is she&#39;s working with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call the other two we need their help.&#34; Kevin nods and calls the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They will be here soon,&#34; Kevin informs Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He can&#39;t believe the love of his life is still alive. After three months of suffering his prayers have been answered. He will make Bianca and whoever works with her pay, that&#39;s a promise.</p>
