                <p>It&#39;s been seven months since Lisa and Alessandro got married. Things have been going great between them. The day after they were married, Alessandro took her to Greece for two weeks when they got to know each other better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They spent many hours naked and just enjoying each other. However, they also did go sightseeing and spent lots of time at the beach or in the pool. Grandpa stayed with them until after Christmas and promised to come and visit again. Lilani is now speaking Italian like a pro. Alessandro and the guys learned Afrikaans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They struggled in the beginning, but after a few months, they finally nailed it. Marna and Jake exchanged numbers at the wedding and now talk every single day. He even flew down to South Africa a few times to visit her. Johnny and Aurora still haven&#39;t confessed their feelings for each other. They pretend they don&#39;t like each other to everyone&#39;s frustration. Kevin is still single saying he&#39;s not ready for commitment and enjoys his bachelor life too much to be tied down and grandma and grandpa visit them often they can&#39;t wait to meet their great-grandchildren.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby, are you sure you are up to host this dinner&#34;. Alessandro asks his very pregnant wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes baby, besides it would be great having everyone here. It&#39;s been how long since we all had dinner together.&#34; Lisa says to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro wraps his arms around Lisa and kisses her on the cheek. &#34;You know I can&#39;t wait for the Triplets to be born. I&#39;m curious about the gender. Alessandro says while rubbing her belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah? But you were the one that said we must wait until birth.&#34; Lisa reminds him. Lisa and Alessandro have made the nursery look like something out of a storybook. These three are going to be spoiled by their great-grandfather, aunts, and uncles. Lisa&#39;s due date is fast approaching, and they have everyone over for a grill before the babies arrive. She&#39;s been very lucky and so far has had a relatively easy pregnancy. To Alessandro, Lisa makes pregnancy look damn sexy. Right now she&#39;s busy licking ice cream, and it&#39;s taking everything in him not to kick everyone out, so he can take her right now on that sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walks up to her and whispers exactly what he&#39;s thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I hate to break it to you, Hulk, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, way to shoot a man down&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa turns around and wraps her arms around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That won&#39;t be happening because I&#39;ve been having contractions for the last half an hour, and now they are closer together. We&#39;re going to meet our babies soon&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Why didn&#39;t you say anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I wanted to make sure they were the real thing and not Braxton hicks like two weeks ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stand up and tell everyone. &#34;You guys go. We&#39;ll clean up here, and I will take Lilani to my house.&#34; Johnny says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call us when you know what&#39;s going on. We can&#39;t wait to find out the genders of the babies.&#34; Aurora hugs Lisa and so does everyone else. We go inside and grab the bags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready?&#34; Alessandro asks as they head out to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a little nervous but beyond excited to hold them in my arm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll be great, and I will be there with you the entire time. You can hit me, cuss me or do whatever you think of. I will take it&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa laughs. &#34;I might just take you up on that&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much longer before I can push them out?&#34; Lisa growled out as another contraction hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soon, Mrs. Mancini, you&#39;re almost delated.&#34; The nurse tells Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then another contraction hits, and she grabs Alessandro&#39;s hand squeezing the life out of it. Lisa hates needles, that&#39;s why she decided on natural birth, but now she regrets making that decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Lisa, it looks like you&#39;re ready to push.&#34; To Lisa&#39;s great relief, the doctor delivers the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t know how long she&#39;s been pushing when she finally feels pressure down there followed by the sound of her baby crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Lisa push when you are ready, baby number two is ready to come out.&#34; The doctor says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa was exhausted. Pushing one baby out is hard enough but three? That shit is crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were so amazing, Lisa&#34;. Alessandro looks down at her with so much adoration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. and Mrs. Mancini, meet your boys.&#34; The doctor says bringing all three of their boys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are beautiful just like their mother,&#34; Alessandro says admiring his three boys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you decided on names?&#34; The doctor asks them. Lisa nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby number one&#39;s name will be Alexander Marcello Mancini.&#34; Lisa looks at their firstborn. He also has black hair like his father and his brown eyes. They decided to name him after Alessandro&#39;s father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby number two Gabriele Mason Mancini&#34;. He also has his father&#39;s black hair but his mother&#39;s blue eyes. Alessandro asked to name one son after his brother and him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby number three Johannes Petrus (JP)&#34;. He looks like Lisa&#39;s with brown hair and blue eyes. Lisa named him after her father and grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are perfect&#34;. Lisa smiles looking at her three handsome sons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, just like their mother&#34;. Alessandro says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro went to inform their family and friends about the details, but they requested a few moments alone with the Triplets before welcoming visitors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want to hold them?&#34; Lisa asks Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;I don&#39;t want to drop them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t, here take Alexander&#34;. She said handing him over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked a little scared at first but a few minutes later it was like his instinct kicked in as he swayed from one side to another and cooed at him. This right here, getting to see the four people who mean the most to Lisa in this world is something she would never forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should probably let everyone in. The sooner they see them, the sooner they can head home so that you can rest.&#34; Alessandro suggests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay&#34;. She says taking Alexander, so he can let their family and friends in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later he was back with everyone in a line and Lisa&#39;s room was packed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are my grand babies?&#34; Grandma asked as soon as she entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are beautiful, I&#39;m going to spoil them rotten.&#34; Grandpa says smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come, let&#39;s take a look at the mini Mancini&#39;s.&#34; Kevin says enthusiastically. Lisa chuckles and Alessandro hands the boys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are precious.&#34; Aurora beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I can&#39;t believe we made them&#34;. Lisa smiled and leaned her head on Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me neither.&#34; He says wrapping his arms around her kissing her on top of the head. They watch as the boys get passed one by one family member to the next. Lisa felt exhausted and thankfully Alessandro noticed and kicked everyone out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a long day and Lisa needs to get some rest. Maybe you guys can come back sometime tomorrow.&#34; He suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to give them back.&#34; Aurora pouted. She had had JP for the last five minutes, refusing to give him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Aurora, they had a long day.&#34; Johnny tried getting her to hand him over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait just a little while longer.&#34; She insists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going to get going, I will see you in the morning,&#34; Sophia says kissing her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks&#34;. Lisa smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did good, little one,&#34; Kevin said hugging her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, my friend.&#34; He did the whole man shake with Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are all going to go, call us when you&#39;re up for visitors,&#34; Jake says hugging her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will&#34;. Lisa hugged him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny also hugs her before leaving with Aurora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it&#39;s just her and her four boys.</p>
