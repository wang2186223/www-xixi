                <p>A blind billionaire&#39;s marriage of convenience ignites unexpected passion. But when deadly schemes from his past resurface, can their fragile bond survive? For Lisa, protecting her sister means risking everything—even her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t wait to get off the airplane to breathe fresh air and stretch my legs. We have been on the flight for several hours now. My little sister and I are going to Rome for our vacation. I look out of the window and see Rome moving closer. Looking at Lilani, I can&#39;t help but think about my parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car accident claimed both of their lives one year ago after they came back from one of their friends&#39; weddings. I remember when I got the call from the hospital informing me to go to the emergency room, which changed our lives forever. Lilani is so young she needs our parents; when the tooth fairy comes to visit, she runs up to her mother and shouts, &#34;Look, the tooth fairy was here.&#34; On her first day at school, they stand watching her when she falls in love and can&#39;t wait to see Mom and tell her about the boy and the first heartbreak. Mom brings ice cream and says everything will be okay. Father wants to break the boy&#39;s neck for hurting his little girl. But now she won&#39;t get to experience any of that. Lilani is only five years old and still doesn&#39;t understand why they don&#39;t come home every night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I planned this vacation to Rome, hoping to take my sister&#39;s thoughts away from all the sadness and from the place that reminds her of our parents every day. I asked for three weeks&#39; leave of absence from my law firm. My boss was kind enough to grant it to me. I planned this so we could go elsewhere on Mom and Dad&#39;s first death anniversary. After their deaths, I became like a mother to Lilani. I used all my savings to make this holiday possible. Now we have reached our destination. While reaching Leonardo da Vinci International Airport, the radiant lights above gently prompted passengers to fasten their seatbelts, signaling that our arrival was close at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We arrived,&#34; I thought as we landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me, Miss, but maybe I can help?&#34; The air hostess made an announcement. &#34;I notice you struggling to catch a taxi. Here, let me get one.&#34; She continues and calls a taxicab. &#34;Thank you so much,&#34; I said to the air hostess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon we will be on our way to the hotel where we will stay. To my relief, the manager can speak English, and after we complete the formalities, a porter accompanies us to our second-floor suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you should rest a little,&#34; I suggest to Lilani when we are alone again. Lilani shakes her head up and down and moves towards the bed. I assisted Lilani in getting into bed. &#34;Sleep tight; I love you,&#34; I said, kissing her forehead. I walk over to the window where the Tibert River flows by. I wish my parents were here with us. Turning around, I notice that Lilani was still sleeping. She will not wake up soon, and I decide to lie down for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up when I heard my sister sing. &#34;Lisa...&#34;, then knocking on the nightstand, &#34;Do you want to build a snowman? Let&#39;s go and play!&#34; Lilani giggles as she climbs onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m awake; now stop singing.&#34; I laugh at my sisters&#39; silliness and feel Lilani on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you feeling, Lily?&#34; I asked as she lay down in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better thank you, Lizzy. Can we do something fun, please&#34;? She asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, let&#39;s walk to the park,&#34; I said after getting off the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We leave the room with the strap of my purse over my shoulder. I can no longer wait to explore this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked around the corner, toward the Tiber River, to the bridge. Here, we stand for a while and watch as the water flows past through the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then we stroll on to the Villa Borghese Gardens. &#34;I recommend that we get a bike.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, then we could eat something after that.&#34; Lilani asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, let&#39;s go grab a bicycle.&#34; We walked over to where we could rent the bicycles. &#34;Excuse me; I would like to hire two, please.&#34; I requested the man and gave him the money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon Lilani and I are on our way, riding through the garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s rest for a while,&#34; Lilani asked after we rode for half an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is a fountain where you can make a wish,&#34; I proposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took Lilani&#39;s hand and walked over to a few people standing, ready to flip a coin. I handed Lilani the coin and said, &#34;Take this.&#34; She took it and closed her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two guys stand far from me, staring at me from head to toe and smirking. This caused my temper to flare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before I could say anything, Lilani shouted at them, &#34;Why are you looking at my sister like that? Don&#39;t you know it&#39;s rude? She&#39;s not a meal you can eat! Stop staring at her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They looked at Lilani, surprised that she had just talked to them that way; they glanced at me and stepped away. I smile at Lilani, and we ride the bikes back and stroll back to the hotel together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go for dinner in the dining area,&#34; I suggest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed Lilani ate a little, then complained about a headache. &#34;I have pain again,&#34; Lilani tells me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get you to bed,&#34; I replied, leading her to our suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night, Lilani,&#34; I said, kissing her on the head. She closes her eyes and falls asleep while I play with her hair, staring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She never complained about this before three weeks ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, I couldn&#39;t sleep. The room is different, and the noises from the window are strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was past midnight when I fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, when I woke up, I noticed my sister missing from bed. I sat up and glanced around the room, only to find Lilani drawing at the table and smiling. &#34;You seem better today,&#34; I remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s because I don&#39;t have pain today, Lizzy.&#34; Lilani smiled happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad you feel better,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So tell me, do you want to go on an outing this morning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, can we go to the park again, please?&#34; Lilani asked me with puppy eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like she enjoyed the park yesterday,&#34; I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got ready for our outing to the park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked around the garden when Lilani started complaining about a headache again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked her up and walked back to our room. &#34;That&#39;s it; I&#39;m taking you to the doctor,&#34; I said sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go and take a bath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, I heard something in the bathroom, became worried, and investigated. As soon as I entered, I found my sister unconscious on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shocked, I kneeled beside her and sighed aloud, relieved when I realized she still had a pulse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I will have to call a doctor immediately. I got up to contact the manager. &#34;Please help me; we need to get a doctor for my sister,&#34; I requested in English.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will phone a doctor immediately,&#34; The manager said and hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I was sponging my sister&#39;s face with a damp cloth, the hotel manager knocked on the door and walked into the room at my invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I called Doctor Rossi,&#34; he informed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put the damp cloth on the bedside table and said, thankfully, &#34;Thank you so much for calling the doctor, Mr. Romano.&#34; I said. Thankfully, he can speak English. Just as the manager wanted to leave, I stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, how will the doctor and I communicate? Does he speak English?&#34; I suddenly asked worriedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do not have to worry about the doctor, Signorina,&#34; the manager assured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The doctor can speak English very well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I honestly don&#39;t know how to thank you for your help, Mr. Romano,&#34; I said gratefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just hope this isn&#39;t serious.&#34;</p>
