                <p>Lisa woke up all sore, and when she looked down, she saw blood. She instantly holds on to her stomach, hoping that nothing has happened to her children. The door opens, and one of the guards opens the door and walks toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get up; the boss wants to see you&#34;. The guard notifies her. Lisa looks up and then tries to stand up, but her body is sore all over. The guard helped her up and put his arms around her to help her walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I will let Mr. Mancini know where you are; you just need to be strong for a few more hours.&#34; He whispers into her ear. Lisa looks up at him; she can&#39;t believe what she is hearing-someone is willing to help her. She just hopes Alessandro will be in time to save her and Lilani; she doesn&#39;t know how much longer she can be strong for both her and her sister. Lisa noticed they stopped, and the guard knocked on the closed door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in&#34;. She hears Mr. Lombardi&#39;s voice. The guard opens the door and pushes Lisa gently inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at you. You have to get yourself cleaned up. I have someone who is interested in purchasing you.&#34; Lisa hears what Mr. Lombardi said and looks at him with wide eyes. This is happening too fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And, just so you know, your sister will be departing this very evening.&#34; With that, Mr. Lombardi shows the guard to take Lisa away. Lisa is in a daze and can&#39;t focus on what&#39;s happening. She needs to get her sister out of this place before tonight. She couldn&#39;t wait for Alessandro to arrive. She needs to save her sister and her children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I told you everything is going to be okay. Nobody is going to take your sister, I promise you.&#34; The guard tells Lisa</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Why would you help us?&#34; Lisa asks him. Wondering why this one isn&#39;t like the others she has met and why he was willing to help them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I have a daughter who&#39;s also here, and tonight I&#39;m taking her, I&#39;ve already informed the right people to help me&#34;. The guard continues explaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long has your daughter been here?&#34; Lisa finds herself asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For the past six months, I&#39;ve been relentlessly searching for her. Each time I come close, the girls are quickly relocated. Frustrated by this, I made the decision to join Lombardi&#39;s organization, well aware that it is one of the largest human trafficking networks in Italy. As soon as I got the job, I tried to find my daughter, and it was not until two weeks ago that I found out where she was, and then one day Lombardi bought her, and now I need to get her out of here and you guys.&#34; Lisa hears him say it, but before she could reply, they stopped in front of the room she was being held in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about anything&#34;. The guard tells Lisa and then opens the door for her before closing it again. Once again, Lisa was left alone. Lisa went to the wall and lay down on the cold floor. Soon she fell asleep, exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Mancini, there&#39;s someone on the phone asking to speak to you urgently&#34;. Leonardo informs Alessandro. Alessandro picks up the phone and starts talking to the person on the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Mancini, I know where your wife and her sister are.&#34; Alessandro hears the man say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to meet me at Johnny&#39;s warehouse in an hour. You don&#39;t have much time to lose if you ever want to see them again&#34;. The man tells Alessandro, then puts the phone down. Alessandro gets up and walks towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Antonio, we have to go to Johnny&#39;s warehouse; it&#39;s urgent,&#34; Alessandro tells Antonio. Antonio nods and follows his boss, wondering what the urgency is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro soon arrives at the warehouse and sees all three of his friends. He gets out and walks towards them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he phone you guys as well?&#34; Alessandro asks them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, he told us to meet here in an hour and that he knows where Lisa and her sister are,&#34; Kevin tells him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood there waiting for the mysterious man when they finally saw someone walking towards the warehouse. Johnny holds on to his gun at the back of his pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you all for coming. My name is Chris Anderson. I know where your wife and her sister are being held.&#34; The man tells them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how do you know this?&#34;. Alessandro asks in a cold voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I work for Lombardi and are one of the guards watching both of them&#34;. Chris tells Alessandro</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want out of this information you gave us?&#34; Johnny asks him as he starts to doubt the reason why the man wanted to meet them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want your help to save my daughter, who is also being held there. I will go with you, of course,&#34; Chris explains. Chris tells them everything about how he met Lisa and what Lombardi is planning to do tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to move fast before eleven; otherwise, the little girl will be sold, and you will never see her again&#34;. Chris says it with urgency. Alessandro and the other three start making plans and inform Chris to meet them back at the warehouse tonight at Seven o&#39;clock. Chris shakes their hands and then disappears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think we can trust him?&#34; Jake asks his friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He seems sincere, and it looks like he&#39;s telling the truth. &#34;Let our team know that they should be prepared for tonight.&#34; Kevin tells them. He knows they can&#39;t trust this man, but this is the only real lead they have to get Lisa and Lilani.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on Lisa, I&#39;m going to get you. Please be safe,&#34; Alessandro says out loud. Then walk towards his car. Alessandro informs Antonio and Leonardo to get ready. He asks Piero to take him to the hospital. On his arrival, he asks the nurse where Alice is. The nurse showed him Alice&#39;s room and then left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Alice. I&#39;m sorry that this happened to you. I thought if I left Lisa, people wouldn&#39;t hurt her, but I was wrong. She was taken and you were shot.&#34; Alessandro talks to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my dear, I&#39;m not mad at you.&#34; Alessandro looked shocked at the old woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t look so surprised, I&#39;m way too young to die. Besides, I still have to help raise the babies.&#34; Alice tells him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now go and bring them back,&#34; Alice says. &#34;O, and make sure you sort this out with Lisa. She is a lovely girl&#34;. Alessandro nods and walks out of the hospital. Tonight they will get Lisa and Lilani.</p>
