                <p>Finally, the day has arrived   he can leave the hospital. He thanked the doctor and the nurses for their service. Then he greets them and leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he still needs to wear the sunglasses, it feels good that he can leave on his own and no one needs to guide him. He will remember this day forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the mansion, Lisa went with Sophia and   to the shops. Lilani was at school when Sophia asked Lisa to go with them. They spent almost five hours shopping. Sophia went into every store and bought a lot of baby stuff, as did grandma, but in the last store, Lisa tells them that she was tired and hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia laughs, &#34;Just this one, then we can grab lunch.&#34; Lisa agrees and walks into the store with them. After spending half an hour there they went to a restaurant and ordered some burgers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm, this is delicious.&#34; Lisa moans as she takes another bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to agree on that, although I don&#39;t usually eat burgers, but today I crave them.&#34; Lisa laughs at Sophia&#39;s face. She has become a great friend. They asked for the bill, then got up and left after paying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro arrives back at the mansion and is greeted by his best friends and Maria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it&#39;s good to see you again, Mancini&#34;, Johnny says as he hugs him then the other two followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We ask Sophia to take Lisa to the shops; she will be here soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you guys&#34;, Alessandro replies. Everybody greeted Alessandro and welcomed him home. They asked if the operation was a success, but Alessandro didn&#39;t say a word. Then Alessandro hears the voice he had been missing for so long; he turns around and waits for Lisa to enter the living room. Sophia and grandma lead Lisa there and tell her to go and sit down while Maria gets them something to drink. As soon as Lisa enters she looks at Alessandro and smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alessandro saw Lisa, his breath got hitched. He has never seen a more beautiful woman than his wife. He notices how she smiles when she looks at him, she got the most beautiful smile he has ever seen. He watches her as she comes closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro, wow, your back&#34;, Lisa says as she stands in front of her handsome husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Lisa&#34;, Alessandro says in a husky voice near her ear. This sent shivers down her spine and Alessandro smirks when he feels her shiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have missed you.&#34; He admits to Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have missed you too&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright you two get a room because we can feel the sexual tension between you guys&#34;, Jake interrupts them. Lisa blushed at Jake&#39;s comment and Alessandro noticed it. They all chatted  while. Every time Alessandro would steal glances at Lisa. He can not wait to tell her the operation was a success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you have time, we have something to discuss&#34;, Johnny tells Alessandro. Alessandro nods and then says, &#34;We can go to my office&#34;. The four guys got up and Jake helped Alessandro to his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what is so important that you want to see me in private?&#34; Alessandro asks them. He noticed how the three men in front of him looked at each other and became concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, we received photos a week ago. The photos indicate that Lisa and Kevin are having an affair....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it true, Kevin? Johnny is interrupted by Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glances at Kevin, and Kevin replies, &#34;You&#39;ve known me for years; I would never do anything like that to you&#34;. Alessandro watches him carefully. It looks like Kevin is telling the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, did you find out who sent these photos?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it appears to be Mr. Lombardi&#39;s handy work. You can tell it&#39;s fake.&#34; Jake&#39;s reply</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m already working on bringing him down as we speak&#34;. Johnny tells him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am glad to hear you got everything under control. I want you to end him for good. He just messed with the wrong guy. I am taking Lisa away for a week to the Bahamas for our honeymoon. Will one of you stay here with my grandparents and watch over Lilani for me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When are you leaving?&#34; Kevin asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow afternoon. I already informed my pilot to get the jet ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I will stay here while you go on your honeymoon, but first, tell us if the operation was a success.&#34; Jake asks Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will tell my wife first, and as soon as we get back, I will let you guys know&#34;, a smirking Alessandro tells his best friends. He must hold his laughter because their faces are priceless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What! You&#39;re not going to tell us, your best buddies, first&#34;, Kevin demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, because I think that&#39;s my wife&#39;s privilege to know first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, we understand. Now let&#39;s get back to Lisa. I think Lilani has already arrived,&#34; Johnny tells them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All four stood up and went to the backyard, where they heard Lilani giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ali, you&#39;re back!&#34; He hears Lilani and watches her run to him. He must admit that she does look like him. He bent down and hugged her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, princess. How are you?&#34; He asks her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m good; we all missed you, especially my sister; she was like an angry dinosaur while you were away.&#34; Lilani whispers in his ears, making Alessandro laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O yeah?&#34; He asks her Lilani nods and then runs off to Alice. Alessandro watches Lisa as she talks to Sophia and Gabriele. He&#39;s glad his brother and Sophia get along with Lisa. He must admit that everyone was right about Lisa&#39;s beauty. He has never seen such a beautiful woman in his life before; he is lucky to have a woman like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of a sudden, everyone&#39;s attention shifts to the door upon hearing a voice that could only be described as utterly irritating. &#34;Alessandro, darling, word on the street is that you&#39;ve returned,&#34; Bianca declares, gracefully making her way towards him. He can&#39;t believe he ever loved her. He watches Lisa when Bianca kisses him and then hugs him. Lisa seems like she wants to murder Bianca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here, Bianca?&#34; He demands it in a cold voice. &#34;I have missed you&#34;, she replies while biting her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, the only thing you missed about him is his money&#34;, Kevin shouts out. Bianca looks sharply at Kevin, and then it hits her. Alessandro must not know about the photos yet because she can see Lisa and the brat is still here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will ask you once: please leave my house; you are not welcome here anymore, and stop calling me baby&#34;, Alessandro says. Bianca looked at him and was shocked at what she had just heard. She thought he would have forgotten about what happened before he left, but it seems like she was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, baby, we both know you don&#39;t mean it.&#34; She continues. Alessandro watched as Lisa got up and went inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He forcefully pushed Bianca aside, urgently demanded Johnny escort him to Lisa, and commanded Antonio to remove Bianca from the premises and ensure that the gate guard would permanently deny her entry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro pushed the bedroom door open and saw Lisa on the bed. It looks like she&#39;s been crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here you are&#34;, he suddenly says. Lisa looks up and sees Alessandro in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I don&#39;t think I can stand much of Bianca for too long&#34;, she says, and Alessandro notices it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, she&#39;s gone now. I have something for you. Look at your bedside table,&#34;, he tells Lisa. Lisa looked confused but did as she was told. She opens the drawer, and she sees a pamphlet about the Bahamas. She then looks at Alessandro again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, seeing we didn&#39;t have a honeymoon, I was thinking of taking you there. That was one of the places you mentioned when we talked.&#34; Alessandro replied. Lisa&#39;s eyes got huge, and then she got up and ran to him, hugging him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you so much. When are we leaving?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow afternoon. Jake and my grandparents will be here to take care of Lilani.&#34; He informs her. Lisa smiles widely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometime later, they went down. &#34;Alright, guys. I would like to announce something. Lisa and I will leave for our honeymoon tomorrow afternoon.&#34; Alessandro informs them. Everyone seems happy about Alessandro&#39;s announcement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia went to help Lisa pack. &#34;Wow, I can&#39;t believe we are going on a honeymoon&#34;, Lisa whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, me neither, but at least he is willing to try&#34;, Sophia says. They were busy for a while when Lilani came in and told them dinner was ready. At dinner, Alessandro can&#39;t seem to take his eyes off Lisa. He swears he would take her right here, right now, if it weren&#39;t for everyone sitting with them. It&#39;s going to be one hell of a night for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Lisa and Alessandro excused themselves and went to bed. Alessandro held Lisa and soon fell asleep with her in his arms. Lisa soon fell asleep with a smile on her face. She can&#39;t wait for tomorrow.</p>
