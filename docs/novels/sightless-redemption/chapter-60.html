                <p>Three months have passed since Lisa gave birth to the triplets. Everything has been going great, the boys are angels. Lisa thought it would be hard to have triplets, but they proved her wrong. Alessandro is a loving father and helps Lisa a lot during the night. He will help Lisa feed and change diapers. Lisa is grateful for a husband like him. Lilani couldn&#39;t believe that her sister had three babies in her belly and wanted to know if she stole the other two. She fell in love with them instantly. The guys mocked and to Lisa, she&#39;s got problems coming when they are all grown up. She must admit she&#39;s outnumbered with four Mancini men in her household. Grandpa was excited when he heard that all three are boys and promised to come and visit soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maria I&#39;m going to go to the shop to get milk and diapers for the boys. Will you be alright with them alone?&#34; Lisa asks her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Si, Mrs. Mancini, we will be alright,&#34; Maria assures her boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t be long, Mr. Mancini will be here shortly.&#34; Lisa kissed her boys and went to the garage. She decides to take the Audi e Tron. She calls Alessandro to let him know she&#39;s going to the shop and to hear if he needs anything, but his phone goes straight to voice mail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey baby, I&#39;m just on my way to the shop. Let me know if you need anything. I love you.&#34; Lisa leaves a message. Lisa was almost at the shop when something hit her on her side of the car. Everything happened in slow motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro just got out of the meeting and decides to call it a night. He misses Lisa and the boys. He can&#39;t imagine his life without his family. He calls Antonio telling him to bring the car to the front. On his way home he notices he has a voice mail from Lisa. He listens to it and smiles. He quickly dials her number. Tut... tut...tut... That&#39;s strange, he thought. He calls home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mancini residents, how can I help you&#34;. Maria&#39;s voice comes through. &#34;Maria, can I talk to Mrs. Mancini&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Sir but Mrs. Mancini left more than an hour ago and still didn&#39;t return. I thought she was with you,&#34; Maria informs him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Maria. When she gets home please let me know.&#34; Alessandro calls Sophia and asks her if Lisa is with her only to hear she&#39;s not there. Worry begins to settle within him. He calls the guys and tells them that Lisa&#39;s nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are on our way. Maybe she&#39;s at the park we will find her.&#34; Johnny calms Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will check the shops near your house. &#34;Thank you. Let me know as soon as one of you finds her.&#34; Alessandro asks Antonio to drive to the shop where Lisa usually goes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please Lisa be okay,&#34; Alessandro whispers. They drive towards the shop and come across an ambulance. The police stopped every car driving in that direction. Alessandro got out of the car just as Johnny pulled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me officer what has happened here?&#34; Johnny asks the chief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, please keep your distance as a terrible accident has happened here as you can see.&#34; The chief explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The body was placed in a black bag ready to be taken away. Alessandro decides to go back to the car as he needs to find Lisa. Something doesn&#39;t feel right and all of a sudden he hears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa&#34;! Alessandro turns around to be met by a scene he wasn&#39;t expecting to see. Everything stopped, and he was in great pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O God no! No! Please wake up!&#34; Kevin shouts. The guys have tears in their eyes while running a hand through their hair. Alessandro runs to the body. He needs to see and make sure that there&#39;s some kind of mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His world stopped. Everything stopped. The one thing he had cherished has been taken away from him. He held her to him tightly and cried hard. He unleashed all of his emotions. He cried so hard he was shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No il Mio amore, please wake up. Please! I love you!&#34; Alessandro shouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We made plans, we have three baby boys who need you! I need you!&#34; Alessandro was inconsolable. He held her body close to him, not wanting to let go; it wasn&#39;t time to let go. He keeps on muttering please come back over and over again while he sat on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, we need to take the body away now.&#34; The paramedic says. Alessandro wasn&#39;t moving or saying a word. Johnny and Jake came to lift him off the ground only to be pushed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Leave me the fuck alone! She&#39;s not de... dea...&#34; It was hard for him to say the word dead. For him, that word shouldn&#39;t be in his vocabulary. Ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, they succeeded in picking him up and letting the paramedics take Lisa&#39;s body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin drives them back to the mansion while Johnny informs the others. They were all devastated and upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was at Alessandro&#39;s mansion. They all are in shock by the news. Johnny tells Alessandro that he will call Lisa&#39;s family to inform them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you&#34;? Alessandro couldn&#39;t handle it. It all became too much for him. He went upstairs to his bedroom. Taking hold of her picture where they hold the triplets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why!&#34; He shouts and slums down to the floor. Rocking himself back and forth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ali? Ali?&#34; Lilani quietly calls as she takes in the scene in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you crying? Where&#39;s my sister&#34;. Alessandro couldn&#39;t answer her. How does he tell her she lost her only sister. He shakes his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilani, baby girl,&#34; Sophia calls softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt Sophia, why are you crying? And Ali?&#34; She touches his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, sweetie, come here.&#34; Lilani shook her head, but Sophia took her in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilani&#34; Sophia says but Lilani pushes away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No aunt Sophia. Where&#39;s my sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh God,&#34; Sophia murmurs, her voice trembling as her emotions overcome her, and tears pour down her face in a torrent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She... she&#39;sideadead Gone to heaven&#34;. Sophia knew she couldn&#39;t keep it a secret from her. She&#39;s going to find out sooner or later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilani ran back to Alessandro and cried so hard. Sophia didn&#39;t want to do anything, so she walked out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ali... Lisa will be okay? Won&#39;t she?&#34; She was sobbing uncontrollably. Alessandro picks her up onto his lap and lets the tears fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa, you have taken everything away from me. Loving you is something I never get bored with. I just want to see you. Hold you. Hug you. Touch you. Cuddle with you. Kiss you. Love you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone is concerned about Alessandro. They know how much he loves Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the meantime</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now I can have my rightful place as the real Mrs. Mancini, not some low-life Bitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything went perfectly as planned, and we succeeded in getting rid of her. Sebastian is such a genius.&#34; Bianca thinks. Yes, she&#39;s out on bail. They don&#39;t have enough evidence to link her with Lisa&#39;s kidnapping. She laid low for a while. Watching Alessandro and his so-called wife. She hired Sebastian to help her. He&#39;s the best assassin in Italy. She hired him to take Lisa out, but he said he got another way to do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, she doesn&#39;t know what went down at the scene. When the truck crashed into Audi she only prayed that the damage was enough to kill Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca calls Sebastian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; He asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you to make sure her brats and sister were with her.&#34; Bianca calmly says to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I got rid of your biggest problem. What more do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just make sure no one finds out this wasn&#39;t an accident&#34;. Bianca says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I know what I&#39;m doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good&#34;. Bianca hangs up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I&#39;m such a sinner. Haha,&#34;. She laughs evil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now my dear Alessandro I will slowly make you pay for what you and your friends did to my father. You will regret the day you messed with me.</p>
