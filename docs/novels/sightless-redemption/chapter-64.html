                <p>Johnny and Jake soon arrive at the bar. &#34;Hey, guys, what&#39;s so urgent?&#34; Jake asks his eyebrows raised. Alessandro shows them to sit down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we get you something to drink first?&#34; Kevin asks nervously because he knows they will have his head. Alessandro watches as Kevin gets nervous. He realizes he&#39;s trying to buy some time before dropping the bomb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A waiter brings more drinks and as soon as she leaves Johnny asks, &#34;Okay will one of you tell us what&#39;s going on? Kevin looks like he&#39;s going to faint any second now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin laughs nervously. &#34;Well, then the short version is um Lisa... She&#39;s still alive.&#34; Johnny and Jake exchanged looks and then looked at Kevin as if he had just grown two heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; Jake asks breaking the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I found out Bianca wanted to hire an assassin to take Lisa and the boys out, so I asked one of my guys to pretend to be an assassin. We got a body out of the mortuary and made the body look like Lisa. On the day of the accident, Lisa was in the car but as soon as the ambulance came, we switched Lisa with the body. She&#39;s still alive but has memory loss. She doesn&#39;t know who she is...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, you&#39;re telling us this whole time you knew Lisa wasn&#39;t dead but decided to keep this quiet?&#34; A pissed-off Johnny asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, look I know I didn&#39;t have the right but if I didn&#39;t act fast Lisa and the boys would&#39;ve been dead by now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck man! You saw how your best friend suffered for the past few months and still, you kept quiet!&#34; Jake continues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck! Don&#39;t you know how hard this was on me also? Don&#39;t you realize that if I didn&#39;t do what I did Alessandro would&#39;ve not only lost his wife but his children as well?&#34; Kevin shouts. Alessandro watches as his friends continue to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough! Look, I know what Kevin did wasn&#39;t right but at the time I think he made the right decision. We have to find out who&#39;s working with Bianca and take them out! I want Lisa back, but I can&#39;t until Bianca and whoever works with her are caught!&#34; Everyone looks at Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s right. What do we have to do?&#34; Jake asks Kevin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The last address I have of Bianca is at one of her father&#39;s old warehouses. I have guys on the lookout there.&#34; Kevin starts showing him all the evidence they have about Bianca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The question is who&#39;s working with her. I can&#39;t seem to find that information.&#34; Kevin concludes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to find out soon because Bianca knows it&#39;s not Lisa&#39;s body that we buried, she&#39;s on the hunt for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave that to me. I have a few guys who owe me some favors. I will put it out there that I want to find her and whoever it is as soon as possible.&#34; Johnny informs them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will have to move your family to a safe house until we catch them,&#34; Jake says to Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, I will do it but not until I get to see Lisa,&#34; Alessandro demands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin sighs, &#34;Look I know you miss her, but we can&#39;t take that risk not yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;m not going anywhere I will send everyone else, but I&#39;m staying,&#34; Alessandro says firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin shakes his head disappointed. &#34;Fine, let&#39;s just get your family to safety first then I will organize that they bring Lisa to the safe house.&#34; Kevin agrees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro nods pleased that he will soon get to hold his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, you will have to be patient. She doesn&#39;t remember anything before the accident.&#34; Kevin reminds him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you told me, but maybe once she sees me and her family she will start to remember,&#34; Alessandro says, hopefully. They look at Alessandro praying that she will remember him. They know it will break him if she doesn&#39;t get her memories back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They start discussing what to do and who to contact. &#34;I will keep you guys up to date,&#34; Jake tells them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When are we leaving for the safe house&#34; Alessandro asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s make it in three days,&#34; Kevin suggests. Alessandro and the other two agree on the date and place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, now I have to go I&#39;m on watch tonight at the warehouse.&#34; Kevin greets ready to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are coming with you, Alessandro you go home and get ready to leave.&#34; Johnny orders. Alessandro nods and stands up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take care guys.&#34; He walks away leaving them behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, and Kevin? Thank you&#34;. Kevin smiles and nods watching his friend leave. He realizes he didn&#39;t have the right to keep this away from him after seeing him walk in earlier he knew he made the right choice to tell them the truth. He knows Alessandro will never survive without Lisa. He has seen how much his friend has suffered these past three months and made a promise to make it up to both him and Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro couldn&#39;t believe what he had just heard. His wife, the only woman he ever loved, is still alive. He will help her remember that&#39;s a promise. These three months felt like his life was empty. He didn&#39;t have a reason to stand up in the morning but now after hearing Lisa is still alive he has a reason. He drove home and went to his son&#39;s room. They have grown so much. Every day they look more and more like their mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, buddies. Did you behave fun today?&#34; He asks his boys when he steps inside their room. He kisses them on the head and tells Alice that he will take it from here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take the rest of the night off.&#34; Alice smiles thankfully for whatever happened that made Alessandro come home to spend some time with his children. At one point she felt sad that the boys not only lost their mother but their father on the same day. Alessandro loved Lisa so much that the day she passed away, something inside him died as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ali! Your home!&#34; Lilani shouts running to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I missed you so much.&#34; Alessandro hugs her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry little one. I promise from now on I will make more time for you guys.&#34; Alessandro smiled at her. Lilani sits next to him talking and playing with the babies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get you ready for bed,&#34; Alessandro announced. Lilani helps him bathe the babies and put them to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now let&#39;s get you ready. Go and take a shower and as soon as you are finished I will read to you.&#34; Lilani smiles and runs to her room. She&#39;s happy to have her Ali back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro went to Lilani&#39;s room and was just about to knock when he heard her prayers. &#34;Thank you, Jesus, for bringing Ali back to us. Help him find a way to let go of Lisa. I know he misses her terribly. I hear him cry at night, sometimes I think he wants to be with her again. But please don&#39;t take him now. I don&#39;t know how to raise three babies on my own. I&#39;m still too young to be a mother. Please help him heal his broken heart. O and Jesus if you can, can you please bring her back to Ali? She&#39;s the only one that knows how to handle this moody man he has become. He must love her. Jesus, please tell my parents that he did love their daughter.&#34; Lilani pray. Alessandro opens the door and walks up to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What story do you want to hear?&#34; He asks her. Lilani thinks then takes a book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleeping beauty.&#34; She gives it to Alessandro. He starts to read the story and notices Lilani fast asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night little one.&#34; He kisses her head and covers her. Looking at her one last time then head to bed.</p>
