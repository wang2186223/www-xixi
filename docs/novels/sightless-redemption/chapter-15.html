                <p>Alessandro&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called Antonio, who was outside the door, and I&#39;m sure he heard everything. Antonio knocked once and went inside, saying, Yes, Mr. Mancini, what can I do for you?&#34; Antonio asked. &#34;I want to find out what happened in the kitchen tonight. Ask the staff and report back to me; I want this matter settled before I leave tomorrow.&#34; I say. &#34;Yes, Mr. Mancini.&#34; Antonio replies. I was busy thinking about why Lisa would act jealous when Antonio came in and said, &#34;Mr. Mancini, I talked to some of the kitchen staff. According to Maria, Miss Viola lied when she said that Mrs. Mancini hit her. &#34; I hear him say: &#34;Thank you, Antonio. I want you to do something for me when everyone is in their room,&#34; I say. Yes, Mr. Mancini,&#34; Antonio replied. I told him what needed to be done. &#34;That would be all. Thank you, Antonio.&#34; I smile. &#34;Pleasure, Mr. Mancini. Before I forget, your grandmother doesn&#39;t seem pleased with the way you handled things with Lisa.&#34; I just sigh, &#34;Thank you, Antonio. Will you please take me to my room and inform everyone to be at breakfast at 07:00?&#34; I say. Antonio takes me to my room, and I go and lay down, thinking about this situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Third-person POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa still can&#39;t believe what happened tonight. &#34;How could Alessandro think of me that low? She thought. She tossed and turned the whole night to think of a way to expose Viola. It was past midnight when she finally fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Alessandro waits for everyone to come down for breakfast, then he hears someone behind him. &#34;Good morning, Mr. Mancini. Did you sleep well?&#34; Viola asks while putting her hands on his shoulder. Alessandro stiffens at her action and just nods without saying a word. After everyone was seated, Alessandro began to speak: &#34;As most of you know, today I will be leaving for a few days. While I&#39;m gone, my wife will be in charge, and I expect everyone to listen to her. If I find out someone acted against her, there will be consequences. Lisa, baby, when breakfast is finished, I want to see you in my office&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he just call me baby?&#34; Lisa thought so, but she must have heard wrong. Viola&#39;s blood is boiling with fury. &#34;How the hell is he so sweet and caring towards that bitch&#34;, she thought after last night that he would still be mad at her. She must think of another plan. After breakfast, Lisa and Alessandro went to his office. Once inside, he pulled Lisa into his embrace, put his head in her neck, and whispered, &#34;I am sorry for overreacting last night and not listening to your side of the story first, but I promise from now on I will listen before I act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dammit, she smells like heaven. He wishes he could bend her over his desk and have his way with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Alessandro; it means so much to me&#34;, Lisa says, interrupting his dirty thoughts. &#34;There&#39;s one more thing; your stuff will be moved to my bedroom&#34;, Alessandro suddenly says. With a stutter, Lisa answered, &#34;I... um are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m very sure that way people won&#39;t notice something off about our marriage,&#34; Alessandro assures her. The truth is, Viola came into his room last night and tried to seduce him; he didn&#39;t know how she thought of seducing him when he couldn&#39;t see. He chased her out and told her if that ever happened again, he would fire her. That&#39;s when he decided Lisa must move into his room. After their conversation, Lisa went to get Lilani so she could say goodbye to Alessandro. Lilani ran to him and cried, &#34;Why do you have to go away, Ali?&#34; She asks, crying. Princess, I will be back before you know it; you must help Lisa and watch over everyone for me,&#34; Alessandro says to the little girl while holding her in his arms. &#34;Pinky promise, you won&#39;t be away for too long&#34;, Lilani holds her finger and takes his hand to make a pinky promise. &#34;Pinky promise&#34;, Alessandro says to Lilani with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Alessandro left, I asked Viola to take Lilani to her room and give her medicine so that she could rest. Viola took Lilani and went to her room. I went to my room, and entered. When I entered, I saw Maria already busy moving my stuff. I offered to help, and before long, all my stuff was in Alessandro&#39;s room. His room is black and silver and bigger than mine and Lilani&#39;s. There&#39;s a round king-size bed in the middle, and he also has a balcony with a beautiful view that looks over the ocean. I went inside the bathroom and was struck by how beautiful it looked. There&#39;s a his and hers shower with black tiles and a golden floor, and his and hers basin that&#39;s also black with gold details. A huge bath in the corner of the bathroom. &#34;This man has good taste&#34;. I thought. I decided to go and help with lunch after exploring Alessandro&#39;s bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day went by quickly without any incidents. Sophia and Gabriele are leaving tomorrow morning early; they say it&#39;s time to head to their own home. I was sad after hearing the news. Sophia and I have gotten close these past few days; they were here, and I&#39;m going to miss them. After dinner, everyone went to the home theater to watch some movies. Lilani fell asleep soon after dinner. I sent her dinner up to her room after Lilani didn&#39;t want to go down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the movie, Maria came and called me, &#34;Mrs. Mancini, there&#39;s a phone call.&#34; Maria says goodbye and leaves. I walk over to the phone and pick it up. &#34;Mrs. Mancini speaking, how can I help you?&#34; Lisa says. &#34;Good evening, Lisa. How is everything at home?&#34; Alessandro&#39;s sweet voice falls on my ear. &#34;That voice alone is making me wet&#34;, I thought. I quickly cleared my throat, getting rid of my dirty thoughts that popped up, and answered, &#34;Everything is going great, Alessandro; Lilani went to sleep just after dinner, and the rest of us are watching a movie; how was your day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exhausting, thanks for asking. I assume your things have been moved to my room?&#34; Alessandro asked. &#34;Yes, Maria moved everything just after you left,&#34; I replied. &#34;Okay, alright, I will call you tomorrow as soon as I can. Have a wonderful night, Lisa&#34;, Alessandro ends our conversation. &#34;Good night, Alessandro&#34;, I say sadly. I miss Alessandro. I have to admit that this arrogant man has made his way into my heart without realizing it. I don&#39;t love him, but we are more civil, so to speak. After the movie is finished, I say good night and make my way to Alessandro&#39;s room. I was just about to go inside when I heard Viola talking from behind. &#34;Where do you think you are going? That&#39;s Alessandro&#39;s bedroom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is actually our bedroom, and if you&#39;ll kindly excuse me, I&#39;ve had a long day and I really miss my husband,&#34; I say sarcastically, entering the room and locking the door. &#34;This is going to be a long night&#34;, I thought as I lay in bed. Everything smells like Alessandro. I really do miss him. I take his pillow and hug it, and soon I fall asleep.</p>
