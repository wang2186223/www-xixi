                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have just finished packing our bags. In a few minutes, new life with Alessandro begins. I&#39;m tired from all the work, but I can&#39;t even nap because Piero will be here any minute now. I just lay on the bed and thought about my marriage to Alessandro. He is so arrogant, bitter, and heartless. I wonder if he will ever be satisfied with my service. O, and his lifestyle, UGG, don&#39;t get me started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Will I ever adapt to that lifestyle? I&#39;m used to a simple life. Not this life with money and all the fancy Patsy stuff I saw last night. We have such different personalities and have nothing in common. We don&#39;t even speak the same language, for the love of all things good! Numerous questions flash through my mind, questions to which I can&#39;t get an answer. I am trying to understand why the wedding should occur so late in the evening. I can understand just as little why there are gold diggers in the world who want to make life difficult for others. Now that I think about it again, I realize I don&#39;t understand Mancini.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Piero&#39;s arrival at the hotel interrupts my busy mind; he&#39;s ready to take me to my future home. I look at my simple dress; maybe I should wear something fancy instead. Alessandro is blind, but the other people aren&#39;t blind. Oh, they can go to hell. I&#39;m an ordinary person, not a rich man&#39;s daughter, and she won&#39;t pretend to be born rich. The porter took my suitcases to the car parked in front of the hotel while I went to pay the hotel bill. Afterward, I greeted the hotel manager and walked to the waiting car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When a car stops, I relax with my brother and sister-in-law on the front porch. &#34;O my soul, what a beautiful girl! God must have taken his time creating her!&#34; My sister-in-law whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you talking about, Sophia?&#34; I asked with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it&#39;s your bride because she just got out of your car, Alessandro.&#34; My sister-in-law explains. I immediately stand up when I hear Lisa&#39;s footsteps approaching. I immediately recognized her by her perfume. I hold my hand out for Lisa, hoping she will take it. My brother and his wife don&#39;t know about the agreement. Then I felt a cold hand take mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allow me to introduce my sister-in-law Sofia and my brother Gabriele Mancini to you, Lisa.&#34; I then turn to my sister-in-law and say, &#34;Lisa is the woman I&#39;m marrying tonight. Her name is Lisa Saunders.&#34; Lisa greets them kindly. I was just about to invite her to sit down when I heard</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s time for talking, guys; grandma has just arrived with the makeup artist,&#34; Sophia says before Lisa can sit down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia, will you take Lisa to her room, please?&#34; I ask before they think I&#39;m not interested in my wife-to-be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not necessary, Alessandro. If you can tell me which room, I&#39;m sure I will find it myself.&#34; Lisa objects. Just as I want to speak when Grandmother says</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good to see you again, my dear. I assume you&#39;ve already met Gabriel and Sophia? Let&#39;s get you ready. Alessandro, please go and get ready.&#34; I nod. I don&#39;t want to get married to a woman I have never seen before, but I can&#39;t say no to my grandmother. I hear Sophia talking to Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you don&#39;t care; I already put your wedding dress and everything that goes with it on your bed this morning,&#34; before they walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come, big brother. I hear Gabriel say something beside me. &#34;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re finally getting married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I were the one to marry her, I would have hidden her too.&#34; Gabriel continues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34; It was all I said before I felt Gabriel lead me to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assume you have already taken a shower; I will only help you get dressed; grandma hired a makeup artist and a hairdresser,&#34; I hear Sophia say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s very kind of you, Mrs. Mancini.&#34; I forced a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia doesn&#39;t allow me to say more: &#34;Since you&#39;re about to become my sister-in-law, Lisa, call me Sophia instead of Mrs. Mancini.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I just have to get used to it,&#34; I tell her. &#34;This is all new to me, and I don&#39;t know Alessandro that we&#39;ll yet.&#34; I continue. &#34;Come, dear, let&#39;s get you ready, and from now on, you can call me grandma,&#34; Maria says as we enter a room. Suddenly, all the tension, worry, and nervousness that I experienced vanished. I couldn&#39;t help but be impressed by the luxury surrounding the room. The bed is a king-size with black and red bedding; there&#39;s a large flat-screen TV fixed to the wall; and on my right-hand side is a large walk-in wardrobe larger than my bedroom back in South Africa. The bathroom is large, with black tiles on the floor and walls. There&#39;s a Jacuzzi and even a small flat-screen TV; the shower is so big that four people can shower at once. I was still checking the room when Sophia said, &#34;We have to get ready before the groom comes and takes you himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What should have been a happy day for me was a day full of worry and stress. The thought of my sister gives me the strength to push through with the wedding. Otherwise, I would have run away already. Finally, I&#39;m dressed in my pure white wedding dress. The dress is shoulderless and has a low neck; at the bust, there are delicate beads and diamonds; her back is open, and then the dress flows past my feet. They let my hair loose, so my natural curls show, and my makeup is skillfully applied. The sled is so long that it looks like I&#39;m dragging the red carpet behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something new,&#34; Sophia said as she put a heart-shaped necklace around my neck, &#34;Something old,&#34; Followed by a beautiful hairpin with white gold roses. &#34;Something borrowed&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia says as she puts a beautiful yet simple bracelet on my arm, &#34;Then last but not least, something blue.&#34; Sophia helps set the garter around my leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are indeed the most beautiful bride I have ever seen, Lisa&#34;, I hear Maria say with admiration. &#34;It is a pity that Alessandro cannot see you today; he will never know how beautiful you look today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you very much, Grandma,&#34; I say with a sad smile. There was a knock on the door, and Sophia went to open it, &#34;Are the bride ready?&#34; I hear Gabriele asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m ready, Gabriele; thank you very much,&#34; I answer as I walk to the door. Maria, Sophia, and I walk behind Gabriele to the back door leading to the garden. There, Gabriele leaves us to go to Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready, dear?&#34; Maria asks as she takes me to Mason. &#34;As I will ever be,&#34; I reply. We stop in front of Mason, &#34;You look beautiful, Lisa. Thank you.&#34; He says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, thank you.&#34; I give a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia, you can go in with me. &#34;Grandpa will take her in,&#34; Maria says to Sophia. Mason took my arm and led me down the aisle. There is an audible whisper among the guests when Mason and I appear in the garden. We stroll with ease. Then we were with Alessandro and Gabriele. I take the arm Alessandro holds out for me and am suddenly aware of how beautiful Alessandro looks in his black suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I hear the priest say:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are gathered here today to unite this man, Alessandro Mancini, and this woman, Lisa Saunders, in the bonds of matrimony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro, do you take Lisa to be your lawfully wedded wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I DO,&#34; Alessandro says in an irritated voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa, do you take Alessandro to be your lawfully wedded husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I DO,&#34; I say sadly, knowing I&#39;m this man&#39;s wife after today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the power vested in me by the State of Vatican City State, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride.&#34; As soon as I hear this, my heart beats fast. What will Alessandro do? Will he kiss me in front of everyone?</p>
