                <p>Alessandro&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriele, Antonio, and I worked all night to find out who was responsible for the assault on Lisa. After three in the morning, Gabriele says he will call it a night and that it&#39;s better to continue the following day after we get some sleep. &#34;He&#39;s right, Mr. Mancini. Let&#39;s sleep, and then we can investigate further tomorrow.&#34; Antonio tells me, but I didn&#39;t think it was a good idea. I was not convinced until Antonio persuaded me otherwise: &#34;Alright, let&#39;s go to bed; we will continue this investigation first thing in the morning.&#34; I dismissed everyone. Antonio takes me up to my room after I said goodnight to Gabriele.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was lying awake thinking how I could&#39;ve prevented all of this had I just listened to Nonna, but my pride got in the way. Look where my arrogant attitude got her. Dammit, I should have asked Piero to return to the hospital to fetch my wife. What if something terrible had happened? What would I have told Lilani? My thoughts were interrupted by someone screaming. I quickly got up and felt my way to the door. The sound of crying became clear when I was in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go to Lisa&#39;s room, open her door, and feel my way to her bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa was having a nightmare, probably about the attack; I lightly shook her. &#34;Wake up, Lisa; it&#39;s just a bad dream,&#34; I said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes shot open once I felt someone shaking me. I realize it&#39;s Alessandro and start crying, holding on to him as if my life depends on it. &#34;He... um... he was in the... uh... room...&#34; I cried out. &#34;Shh, Piccina, there is no one in the room; shh, you just had a bad dream&#34;, Alessandro comforts me. When I&#39;m finally calmed down, I look up at Alessandro, embarrassed. &#34;I am sorry for waking you up; your shirt is wet and full of snot.&#34; Alessandro holds me a while longer before saying, &#34;Do you feel better now? Must I ask someone to get you something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, thank you. I think I will be alright now; sorry for waking you up.&#34; I softly say I&#39;m still feeling embarrassed, but luckily Alessandro can&#39;t see me. &#34;Alright then, if you are going to be okay, I will head back to bed, but in the morning, I want to hear everything that happened, Si.&#34; Alessandro says, and I nod. Lisa, he is blind; he can&#39;t see you! I scolded myself. &#34;Yes,&#34; I softly reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will help you back to bed,&#34; I quickly offered. When Alessandro doesn&#39;t protest and instead holds out his hand, I take it and lead him back. Once in his room, as I was about to help him into bed, Alessandro lost his balance and landed on top of me on the bed. With our faces touching each other, I hold my breath, and my heart beats fast. This is the closest I have ever been to him, and I feel strangely excited about our position. Even though it hurts, I can smell his minty breath on my face, and I can feel his upper body pressed against my breasts, which is causing my nipples to become hard. Suddenly, I tried to get out from under him, but he just lay there, pinning me with his body. Then I hear Alessandro whisper huskily, &#34;You should stop doing that, or you&#39;re going to make a certain member of my body wake up.&#34; His words caused my actions to immediately stop. I lay still, not moving an inch. Then he chuckles and stands up. &#34;Thank you, Lisa; you should go now; we will talk in the morning,&#34; Alessandro says. I quickly get off the bed and make a run for my bedroom. Once inside, I fell to the bed and winched. I completely forgot about my bruised body, then whispered, &#34;What the hell just happened?&#34; After our encounter, I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep; I just played the scene repeatedly in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what seemed like forever, I finally drifted back to sleep, dreaming of Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, when I woke up, I still felt tired. I quickly went to the bathroom, did my business, and showered. I walk to my closet and can&#39;t decide what to wear. Finally, I decided on skinny white denim, a turquoise spaghetti strap flare shirt, and my Vans. I apply eyeliner and mascara, seeing how I don&#39;t like wearing too much makeup. I let my hair fall loose with its natural curls. I look in the mirror and head to the dining room. Just as I walk in, I hear Sophia whistle, &#34;Dam, girl, you look hot.&#34; I blush at the remark and sit beside Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately recognized her vanilla and honey scent. Last night, I had to restrain myself when I was on top of her. I could feel her breasts pressed against my chest, and the fact that she smelled so good did not help either. I wanted to take her there, and then, as soon as she left, I went to the shower because a cold shower would calm my excited member. Now I have to sit next to her again; this will be one hell of a day for me. Wait, I can&#39;t feel like this; I can&#39;t think of her that way, and I sure as hell can&#39;t fall in love with her. My heart only belongs to Bianca. &#34;Alessandro, are you listening?&#34; Gabriele&#39;s voice brings me back out of my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... um... what did you say?&#34; I ask stuttering. &#34;I said Detective Guido would be here just after breakfast to talk to Lisa,&#34; Gabriele said again. &#34;When he&#39;s here, send him and Lisa to my office,&#34; I tell him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after breakfast, Antonio announces Detective Guido&#39;s arrival. Once inside, the detective greeted us and began asking us questions. Lisa tries not to cry as she tells him about the attack. &#34;I was sitting on the bench waiting for the next bus when a tall man with dirty blond hair walked up to me; he came and stood in front of me trying to make a conversation.&#34; Lisa took a big breath and continued, &#34;I asked him just to leave me alone because I am a married woman. He then began to make remarks about how stupid my husband is for letting me stay out late, saying that my husband wouldn&#39;t mind sharing me. I started shifting up so that I could escape; when he got closer, I jumped up and started to run,&#34; She took another big breath. &#34;He chased me and eventually caught up with me; he grabbed me by my neck and threw me against a wall, then he started kicking me and yelled at me being stupid. Then, bent down and wanting to rip my shirt apart, I suddenly realized that if I didn&#39;t fight back, this man was going to rape me. I bit hard on his hand, and when he was off me, I got up and kicked him in between his legs, and then I made a run for it while he was still lying on the floor. I think he tried to follow me. I saw a dumpster and hid inside. I don&#39;t know how long I was in there, but after a while, I got the courage to climb out. I made sure the coast was clear. I started walking, and that&#39;s when I realized I was lost. I don&#39;t know how I found my way home.&#34; Lisa sobs after recounting the events of last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Detective Guido asked Lisa if she could identify the man. Lisa replies with a small &#34;Yes.&#34; I was silent the whole time. I could hear she was trying hard not to break down; I&#39;m sure my knuckles turn white as I make a fist. I swear if I get this guy, I will make him pay for what he did. The detective got the man&#39;s description and told me he would be in touch. With that, he left.</p>
