                <p>Alessandro went back to the mansion and went to Lilani&#39;s room. &#34;Hey princess. How are you feeling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, thank you. Where were you?&#34; Lilani asks him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I quickly went to Aunt Sophia to ask them something,&#34; Alessandro tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Lisa is sleeping if you want to know. Is she alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. Yes, she&#39;s alright now. Why do you ask?&#34; Alessandro asks, his voice filled with confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s crying a lot,&#34; Lilani says. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I think she&#39;s just glad to be back.&#34; He assures Lilani. Lilani nods then asked, &#34;When are we going back home? And when is Nonna coming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soon little one very soon, Nonna will be back one of these days, I promise,&#34; Alessandro says. Alessandro spends a few more minutes with her. Then he goes to Lisa&#39;s room. When he opens the door he finds the bed empty. Just as he was about to leave, the bathroom door opens, and Lisa walks out with a towel around her. Lisa watches Alessandro and sees the lust in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry I should have knocked,&#34; Alessandro says embarrassed that he shamelessly checked her out. Just as he turned around, Lisa walks up to him and hugs him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for saving us.&#34; She says to him. Alessandro turns around facing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will never let anything happen to you, our babies, or Lilani. I will protect you as long as I live. I love you so much. I&#39;m not just saying it because you want to hear it, I&#39;m saying it because I mean it.&#34; Lisa looks up at him and sees that he is sincere. She stands on her toes and brings her lips to his, kissing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; Lisa says, walking to the bed to get her clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just need time; you hurt me when you said you kissed her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro nods, saying, &#34;I understand. I won&#39;t push you to forgive me.&#34; Lisa hears the sadness in his voice. She wants to tell him she forgives him, but she&#39;s still hurt. She loves this man with her whole heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia, Gabriel, and our grandparents are coming over tonight,&#34; Alessandro informs her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, I have missed them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, she&#39;s mad that I didn&#39;t tell them about anything. She had her baby the day you went missing.&#34; Alessandro tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, I can&#39;t wait to meet her, but isn&#39;t it too early for the baby?&#34; Lisa says this excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know? You will have to ask her, but please don&#39;t overstress yourself.&#34; Alessandro pleads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t, I promise.&#34; Alessandro nods then leaves Lisa alone in the room. Lisa is left with her thoughts. Why can&#39;t she just forgive him? He did it to protect them. She thought. She decides to take a rest for a while before Sophia comes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening Sophia and the others arrived. Alessandro went up to call Lisa and tell her they were here. Lisa quickly dressed and then went downstairs. When Sophia sees Lisa she walks up to her and hugs her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O honey, I&#39;m so sorry for what happened to you, and congratulations I heard you&#39;re expecting three Mancini&#39;s.&#34; Sophia winks. Lisa laughs and replied, &#34;Thank you. Yes, it&#39;s still unbelievable I can&#39;t believe three human beings are growing inside me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, me neither. Oh hell, hopefully, they will be like you and not the father. We will truly need heaven&#39;s assistance if we are to deal with four Alessandros all at once.&#34; Sophia laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! I hear you. I&#39;m not that bad.&#34; Alessandro defends himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure you are an angel sent from hell.&#34; Kevin also mocks. Alessandro gives him a finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma walks over, &#34;Alright now it&#39;s my turn. Lisa, my dear I&#39;m so sorry for my grandson&#39;s behavior, and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back safely.&#34; Lisa hugs grandma when grandpa pulls her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations dear, I hope these three don&#39;t inherit their father&#39;s stupidity&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dinner is ready. We can go to the dining room.&#34; Jake tells everyone. They all went to sit down and start to eat. The guys are busy chatting about men&#39;s stuff while Sophia and Lisa talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to come with me tomorrow night,&#34; Sophia asks Lisa. &#34;Alright, where are we going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps we could go out for dinner? So dress nicely.&#34; Sophia says kindly. Lisa nods and then continues eating. After dinner, Lisa and Sophia take the plates and start doing dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s the baby?&#34; Lisa asked. &#34;In the bedroom sleeping. Do you want to meet her?&#34; Sophia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would love to.&#34; Lisa and Sophia walk to the bedroom where the baby is sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O my, she&#39;s beautiful. What is her name?&#34; Lisa asks softly as she stares at the little baby in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna Aria Mancini.&#34; Sophia smiles. &#34;We named her after her grandmother&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a beautiful name. May I hold her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia gives a nod and passes Luna over to Lisa. Lisa holds the baby girl against her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She looks just like Gabriele.&#34; Lisa notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that she does,&#34; Sophia says happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s so small. Wasn&#39;t she born too soon?&#34; Lisa asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Turns out our doctor made a mistake about how far along I was.&#34; Sophia shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, well, at least she is in good health.&#34; Lisa holds the baby when Alessandro walks in. The sight in front of him makes his heart melt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look good with the baby in your arm&#34;. Alessandro compliments. Lisa looks up at him and gives him a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway, we want to let you know, Johnny just woke up,&#34; Alessandro tells them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fantastic news. We will be there in a bit.&#34; Sophia says. Alessandro nods and then leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assume you are mad at him?&#34; Sophia asks with caution. Lisa sights. &#34;I don&#39;t know, I mean he told me he did it to protect us, but the thought of him kissing her makes me mad.&#34; Lisa admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know honey, but take it from his point of view, he received all these threats. He didn&#39;t know what to do. He was trying to protect you. Look I don&#39;t talk good about what he did, but I have never seen him in love like this before. He truly loves you.&#34; Sophia says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa looks at Sophia and realizes she&#39;s overreacting. Maybe she should give him another chance. Sophia, thank you so much.&#34; Sophia smiles then they walk to Johnny&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Johnny. I am so glad that you are alright.&#34; Lisa says as soon as she walks into his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t leave you this soon.&#34; Johnny jokes. Lisa walks up to him and hugs him with Sophia next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations on the birth of your precious baby girl!&#34; Johnny says to Sophia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. Gabriele will require a shotgun once she grows up.&#34; Sophia laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hear you&#39;re bringing three Mancini&#39;s into this world. God help us that they don&#39;t have their father&#39;s personality.&#34; Johnny says. Alessandro throws him a finger and everyone laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is everyone saying that?&#34; Alessandro asked. They laughed at Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do realize how you were as a child and now?&#34; grandpa asks with amusement in his voice. They all spent a few hours with Johnny when Gabriele tells Sophia they should go. They bid everyone good night and then went home. Lisa went to Lilani&#39;s room and found her fast asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodnight baby girl,&#34; Lisa says and kisses her on the head. She covers her with a blanket then walks out. On her way to her room, she sees Alessandro about to go into another room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can stay with me if you want to.&#34; Lisa offers. Alessandro looks at her and nods, then walks with her to her room. Lisa went to the bathroom changed into pajamas and did her business. When she walks out she sees Alessandro laying down on the bed. She walks to her side and slips in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodnight, Alessandro,&#34; Lisa bids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night, Lisa.&#34; Lisa turned and soon fell asleep feeling someone pulling her closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro and Sophia make plans the next day to surprise Lisa. &#34;Everything is going to work out well. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll make sure Lilani and Alice are well taken care of.&#34; Sophia tells her brother-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you be so sure? Lisa won&#39;t forgive me easily, and I don&#39;t blame her.&#34; Alessandro replied. Sophia shakes her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just know. That woman loves you.&#34; Alessandro just shakes his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You better get ready. It&#39;s almost time to go and get Lisa. Don&#39;t mess this up, or I will have your balls.&#34; Sophia threatens him. Alessandro laughs and then goes to get ready, praying everything works out well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the meantime, Lisa is busy getting ready for her dinner date with Sophia. She hasn&#39;t seen Alessandro the whole day after breakfast. He told her he has important meetings and will probably be late. She must admit she misses him. She decides to wear a long red dress with a low cut at the breast and a high slit that shows her leg. She let her hair loose and applied light makeup. After she&#39;s done, Lilani comes in to tell her Sophia has arrived. Lisa quickly takes her purse then walks out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, you look gorgeous.&#34; Sophia gives her a heartfelt compliment. Lisa smiled, and the two walked out. Sophia tells her driver where she wants to go. Soon they are on their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are almost there. I want you to put on this blindfold, and please don&#39;t peak.&#34; Sophia tells Lisa. Lisa takes the mask and puts it on wondering what she&#39;s up to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are here. Give your hand and I will lead you.&#34; Lisa does as she is told and follows Sophia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you can take it off.&#34; Lisa hears Sophia say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she takes it off she notices that they are standing in front of Alessandro&#39;s private jet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Lisa asks unsure. Sophia smiled and nodded towards something. Lisa turns around and sees Alessandro walking up to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa, baby. I want to ask if you will go away with me for a few days&#34;. Alessandro gazes at Lisa, his eyes filled with hope, as he poses his question. Lisa looks at him. She doesn&#39;t know what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I.....</p>
