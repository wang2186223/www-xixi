                <p>Alessandro takes Lisa into his arms and whispers. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me where you were?&#34; Lisa didn&#39;t answer, too afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m asking you a question! Why didn&#39;t you tell me where you were when you remembered who you were?&#34; He asks in a low dangerous voice. Lisa shook her head and opened her eyes. Alessandro was now staring down at the triplets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, baby,&#34; Lisa whispers and notices he is still not looking at her, and it hurts so bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa?&#34; Sophia broke the tension between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O my! It&#39;s you!&#34; Sophia ran to Lisa when she saw it was Lisa. Lisa hugs Sophia while keeping her eyes on Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We missed you so much.&#34; Sophia cries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Sophia. I wish none of this ever happened.&#34; Lisa whispers with tears flowing down her cheeks. Sophia let Lisa go and stepped aside, so the others could greet her. Lisa hugs everyone and cries out of happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, my dear; you don&#39;t know how much we have missed you,&#34; Grandma tells Lisa as she hugs her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have missed you as well.&#34; She thought she would never see them again. Lilani&#39;s eyes went wide when she saw her sister standing there. She can&#39;t talk; she just stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go inside,&#34; Lisa tells them and turns to go and help Alessandro with their boys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s take them to their room,&#34; Lisa tells him. Alessandro nods and then follows her up to the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry for not making contact with you. I was scared.&#34; Lisa told him as soon as they lay the boys down. She looks at her three sons; they have grown so much that Lisa wishes she could turn back time, but sadly she can&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry for snapping at you. It&#39;s just- I thought I had lost you forever, and after seeing you, I- I don&#39;t know.&#34; Alessandro speaks to her. He walks up to her and takes her into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have missed you so fucking much.&#34; He looks down at her and then bends down to kiss her. Lisa has missed this, his touch, his lips on her, everything about him. After some time, they separated, both of them breathing heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go down; everyone wants to talk to you. Especially Lilani. She had been praying that you would return to us.&#34; Alessandro takes her hands and leads her down to where everyone is waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa!&#34; Lilani shouts as soon as Lisa walks into the living room. &#34;I knew that if I prayed hard enough, you would return to us.&#34; Lilani cries out. Lisa picked her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have missed you so much, baby girl,&#34; Lisa hugged her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you know that Ali cried every single day? He even locked himself in his office for days until Maria told him to go and shower because he was beginning to smell.&#34; Lilani rambled on, making a disgusting face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, my brother won&#39;t live long without you, that&#39;s for sure.&#34; Gabriele has also shared his thoughts. They start to catch up with everything that has happened to Lisa since the day of the accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That Bitch will pay for what she did to you.&#34; Grandma spoke through gritted teeth. She was angry that Bianca did something like this to their family, and she wanted to make sure she gets what she deserves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speaking of her. Do we know where she is?&#34; Antonio asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kevin and the other two are still busy tracking them,&#34; Alessandro replied with his eyes lingering on Lisa. Maria tells them lunch is ready; just as they go to the living room, the doorbell ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will get it.&#34; Leonardo offered and went to check. A few minutes later, Kevin, Sebastian, and Ariana walk in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My timing was perfect.&#34; Kevin smiles when he sees the food. He walks up to Lisa and hugs her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome back, sis.&#34; He whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for saving me.&#34; Kevin nods, then takes a seat. Ariana sits next to Lisa, and they start having a conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mancini, I want to talk to you after lunch.&#34; Kevin suddenly said to him. Alessandro nods, knowing its news about Bianca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After lunch, the guys went to the study to talk. &#34;What&#39;s up, man?&#34; Alessandro asked. His fear was that Bianca had not been found. The thought of losing Lisa all over again makes him shiver in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We found Bianca and who she&#39;s working with,&#34; Kevin informs them and looks at them with a sad expression. He doesn&#39;t know how to tell them who was the one who betrayed their trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It turns out mommy dearest is the one helping her take revenge for killing Mr. Lombardi.&#34; Kevin continues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great two women out on revenge. Well, when are we going to them?&#34; Alessandro asks him. He wanted to teach them a lesson for messing with his family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jake and Johnny will be here at midnight with both of them. They caught them at the airport on their way here. So we suspect that someone close to us informed them about everything.&#34; Kevin growls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to tell us who?&#34; Alessandro asks impatiently. Kevin looks at them, then shakes his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will find out tonight. Let&#39;s say someone in our circle got close to this person.&#34; Kevin still can&#39;t believe they backed stabbed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on Bianca and watch her die slowly,&#34; Alessandro says with so much hatred. They talked for a while when Alessandro excused himself. He went to look for Lisa and found her playing with the Triplets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe they have grown so much,&#34; Lisa said sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have missed three months of their lives.&#34; Lisa cries, looking at her babies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, it&#39;s not your fault,&#34; Alessandro says, sitting beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should never have gone out that day; if I had sent Antonio or someone else, I would&#39;ve been there with you guys.&#34; She continues to cry. Alessandro takes her into his arms and then lifts her face with his finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, if anyone is to blame, it&#39;s Bianca and her family.&#34; Lisa looked into her husband&#39;s eyes and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your right. I am sorry it&#39;s just that I have missed you guys so much.&#34; She sniffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was dreaming about you constantly after the accident. I didn&#39;t know why, so I never told anyone until I decided to search for your name; that&#39;s when I found pictures of you and me on the Internet. Everything I dreamed about was our life together.&#34; She smiles, telling him how she started remembering her life before the accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad that you got your memory back because, honestly, I was nervous about how to handle the situation if you didn&#39;t remember us.&#34; Alessandro truthfully says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go lay down for a bit?&#34; Lisa asks him. She feels tired after the long flight and the reunion with her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, boys, how about you guys go and lay down with Mommy and me?&#34; Alessandro asks his boys. They picked them up and went to their room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro lay on his side, looking at Lisa, who fell asleep instantly. Tonight he will make Bianca pay for everything she did to them.</p>
