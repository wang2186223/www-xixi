                <p>We were busy exploring each other when I heard a commotion downstairs, and I quickly stopped. &#34;Shit, what the hell is going on downstairs&#34;? I quickly get off Lisa and whisper, &#34;This isn&#39;t over&#34;. I bet she&#39;s blushing now. &#34;Can you call Antonio for me, please?&#34; I ask with a voice still full of lust. I hear her voice telling Antonio that he must come up. Just as I&#39;m done dressing, Antonio knocks and enters. &#34;What the hell is going on downstairs&#34;? I demand to know. &#34;Sir, there are a bunch of reporters and a police officer; they are here for Mrs. Mancini&#34;, Antonio says, scared. &#34;And what do they want with my wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Viola went to the police and opened an assault charge against Mrs. Mancini, Sir, and she went to the media, claiming the two of you were lovers. When you asked Mrs. Mancini for a divorce, she started assaulting and threatening you, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I&#39;m mad; how dare Viola tell such lies? &#34;Will you take me downstairs and then call my lawyer? Lisa, you can come with me; I will not let them take you,&#34; I say in a stern voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was scared I never once had a run-in with the law. Why is it that every time Alessandro and I get intimate, he either withdraws or something happens? We quickly went downstairs and found the officers waiting for us. &#34;Good evening, Mr. Mancini. We are sorry for disturbing you this late.&#34; One of the officers says, &#34;Mrs. Mancini, we have to take you down to the station for questioning. Someone opened an assault case against you.&#34; The officer explains. I became visibly nervous. Alessandro takes my hand and says, &#34;I will go with you; don&#39;t worry.&#34; He tells me I agree and went with the officer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the police station, Alessandro&#39;s lawyer arrives. Antonio gives him something, and with that, the lawyer goes out. Sometime later, the lawyer and the police chief come back. &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Mancini, we all here at the station are very sorry for any inconvenience we have caused you. Mrs. Mancini, after seeing the evidence, you are free to go.&#34; The officer tells us I wonder about this so-called evidence but decide to ask Alessandro about it later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we walk out of the station, the media are already there. Antonio and Piero help us to the waiting car, and once inside, Alessandro begins to speak: &#34;Antonio, I want you to find Miss Viola and bring her to me. Then I want you to send a copy of our evidence to the media. Viola doesn&#39;t know who she messed with. When I&#39;m finished with her, she will leave this country and never return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mr. Mancini, I will do it as soon as we get home,&#34; Antonio assures his boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arriving at the mansion, Alessandro steps out and holds his hand out to me. I take it and lead him inside. &#34;Can I get you something to drink?&#34; I softly ask. &#34;Yes, I think I need strong coffee about now.&#34; Alessandro&#39;s reply. I went to the kitchen to make some coffee for everyone. I take a tray and bring it to the small living room. &#34;I am just going to check on Lilani,&#34; I say, concerned that my sister has heard all of this commotion. &#34;Maria is with her; Lilani didn&#39;t hear a thing; she is still sleeping peacefully&#34;, Grandma assures me. I let out a sigh of relief. I was worried that Lilani heard everything. I take a seat next to Alessandro and then carefully ask, &#34;What is this evidence you are talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro rubs his face before saying, &#34;Remember the day Viola accused you of hitting her? Well, after our fight in the office, I asked Antonio and other staff what happened, and they confirmed what happened. So I asked Antonio to put cameras with sound everywhere in the house. That is how I found out about everything-how she treated you and how she planned on getting me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, I didn&#39;t expect that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, wow, I don&#39;t know what to say; thank you, Alessandro,&#34; I say, kissing him on the cheek. Alessandro smirks. &#34;I also heard what you said to her.&#34; I realize that he knows what I said and look up at Alessandro, who&#39;s still smirking. &#34;So you missed me?&#34; Alessandro teased. &#34;I did not; I was just telling her that I miss you.&#34; I try to defend myself. &#34;Whatever you say, Mrs. Mancini,&#34; Alessandro laughs. &#34;I&#39;m going to kill that woman; how dare she come after our family!&#34; I hear Grandma say, She looks angry right now. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, grandma, I will sort this mess out,&#34; Alessandro assures his grandmother. &#34;I trust you on this; I want her gone before we go back to Milan,&#34; Grandma says. Yes, sadly, they are also leaving the day after tomorrow. The four of us sit there in silence for some time when I hear Alessandro say, &#34;It&#39;s getting late; you should rest&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m not tired yet.&#34; I deny it with a yawn. &#34;Then what&#39;s with that yawning? Go and sleep.&#34; Alessandro says once again: I stand up and bid them goodnight just as Antonio comes in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear Lisa&#39;s footsteps disappear, and Antonio says, &#34;We found her, Mr. Mancini.&#34; I nodded. &#34;Thank you, Antonio. Tomorrow morning we will visit her.&#34; I tell him. &#34;Yes, Mr. Mancini.&#34; Antonio replied. &#34;Alright, son, we are going back to bed.&#34; I hear Grandpa speak. &#34;Goodnight, grandma and grandpa,&#34; I say. Goodnight, my son&#34;. Grandma says, and I feel her placing a kiss on my cheeks. &#34;If you can just take me to my room,&#34; Antonio, help me to my room and bid me goodnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, on the table, Alessandro asks, &#34;What time do we have to get Alice?&#34; &#34;Around ten,&#34; I answer. &#34;Okay, I will send Piero to get her,&#34; Alessandro says. Just after breakfast, Alessandro leaves with Antonio, and I take Lilani down to the beach. &#34;This is my favorite spot,&#34; Lilani says as they sit under the palm tree. &#34;I can&#39;t wait to run and play here.&#34; I hear her say &#34;One of these days, you will get to run around and go to school,&#34; I assure her. I look up when Maria calls her. &#34;It looks like we forgot all about the time. Come, I think Alice has arrived.&#34; I took Lilani&#39;s hand and walked back to the house. &#34;Good morning, Mrs. Mancini.&#34; Alice greets. &#34;Good morning, Alice. Did you have a nice trip?&#34; I asked her. &#34;Yes, thank you, dear. This must be Lilani.&#34; Alice asks. &#34;Yes, Alice, this is my sister Lilani.&#34; I introduced her. &#34;Lilani, this is Alice. She&#39;s going to take care of you.&#34; I informed her. Lilani looks at the old woman and says, &#34;Nice to meet you, Aunt Alice.&#34; Alice takes her hand and shakes it. &#34;Let me show you where your room is,&#34; I say after the introduction is finished. &#34;This is your room; if you need anything, just give me a call. Lunch will be served at 13:00. We will let you alone now.&#34; I informed her. &#34;Thank you, dear,&#34; Alice says, then goes inside. I took Lilani, and the two of us went to the playroom. &#34;Hey, Aunt Alice,&#34; I hear Lilani say. &#34;Hey, sweetie. What are you playing?&#34; Alice asks. &#34;We are playing with Barbie and Ken. Do you want to play with us?&#34; Lilani asked. Alice walks over and takes a seat next to Lilani. The two of them start talking to each other while I watch them. &#34;Do you have any children?&#34; Lilani asks Alice. &#34;No, my dear. I don&#39;t.&#34; Lilani looks at Alice sadly. &#34;I can be your grandchild if you want to. Then you won&#39;t be alone and sad.&#34; Lilani suggested. &#34;You are such an angel. I won&#39;t mind having you as a grandchild.&#34; Alice tells her. &#34;What do you call grandma in your language?&#34; Lilani asked. &#34;Nonna, my dear.&#34; Lilani looks up and repeats the word. &#34;Okay, from now on, I will call you Nonna.&#34; Lilani declares. Alice smiles at the little girl. &#34;I would love that little one.&#34; Alice and Lilani start playing again until Maria comes to tell us lunch is ready. I noticed during lunch that Alessandro hadn&#39;t come back yet. &#34;Probably still working,&#34; I thought. &#34;You can rest or explore after lunch,&#34; I tell Alice. &#34;Thank you, dear. I think I will go and take some rest.&#34; Alice smiles. I take Lilani&#39;s hand and say, &#34;Time for a nap. You can play with Alice later.&#34; Lilani nods, then follows me upstairs. &#34;Will you stay with me?&#34; Lilani asked? I got on the bed and held Lilani. Soon, we both fell asleep. I wake up and notice Lilani is gone. I quickly got up and went to search for her. I found her playing with Alice. &#34;Here you are. I was looking for you.&#34; I tell her. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Lissy. &#34;You were sleeping peacefully, so I decided to come and play,&#34; Lilani informs me. &#34;That&#39;s alright. You have to take a bath soon; it&#39;s almost time for dinner.&#34; Lilani nods and continues playing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others and I were just about to have dinner when Alessandro and the others arrived, and judging from the look on Alessandro&#39;s face, he wasn&#39;t in a good mood. Lilani notices Alessandro and runs up to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ali, your home; I have missed you so much, I want to show you my new Nonna,&#34; Lilani says excitedly. Alessandro laughs and lets Lilani lead him. &#34;Nonna, this is my Ali, and Ali, this is my Nonna,&#34; Lilani introduces them. Alice offered her hand to Alessandro and said, &#34;Pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Mancini. I heard a lot about you from Lilani&#34;. Alice greets. &#34;Pleasure to meet you too, Alice,&#34; Alessandro says. Alessandro sits down and starts eating his dinner. I can tell that wherever they went today, it didn&#39;t go too well, but I decided not to ask. Lilani asked Alice to go with her after they ate. &#34;Alright, dear, let&#39;s go,&#34; Alice says. Alessandro asked Leonardo and Antonio to go to his office, and I went to help Maria and Grandma clear the table. I went to check on Lilani only to find both of them fast asleep on Lilani&#39;s bed. I smile, knowing we made the right choice.</p>
