                <p>At the hospital, we quickly went to my sister&#39;s room. When we went in, I saw her lying awake and taking Alessandro to bed. &#34;Hi, baby; how are you feeling?&#34; I immediately want to know. A soft, weak chuckle escapes Lilani as she says, &#34;I am feeling great, Lisa; I missed you.&#34; Then she looks at Alessandro and says, &#34;Hi, Ali, thank you for saving my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a pleasure, Principessa; I am glad you are doing better,&#34; Alessandro simply replies. &#34;What is a princi... whatever you just called me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It means princess, little one,&#34; Alessandro chuckles. &#34;Your room is almost ready; by the time you come home, everything will be in place,&#34; I tell my sister. We talked for a while, then said goodbye to Lilani, telling her we would check in with her tomorrow. Lilani nods and then closes her eyes again. I took Alessandro&#39;s hand, and we walked out of the room. &#34;Thank you for coming with me. I appreciate it.&#34; I say to him. Alessandro just squeezed my hand softly. The drive home is quiet, and when we stop at the mansion, I offer to take Alessandro to his room. Alessandro nods, and I help him inside, walking up the stairs. Once we reached his room, I kissed his cheek and said, &#34;Good night.&#34; Alessandro gave me a small smile and said, &#34;Good night, Lisa.&#34; Then he went into his room. I decide to go to my room and hopefully fall asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following five days were hectic; we finished Lilani&#39;s bedroom and put her clothes in her wardrobe. Today, Lilani is coming home. I can&#39;t wait to get my sister to the hospital. Alessandro was here the whole time, making sure everyone followed his demands. After breakfast, the two of us set out to get Lilani. We make our way to her room and walk in. Lilani was already sitting up straight, waiting for them. We greet each other, and I help Lilani get dressed. As soon as we were finished, the doctor came in. &#34;Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Mancini; I see my patients are ready to leave,&#34; he said, smiling. &#34;Yes, I am a ready doctor,&#34; Lilani replied with a massive smile. &#34;Just sign the discharge forms; here&#39;s the schedule for her treatment and her next appointment with me. Remember not to wash her hair like usual, take baby shampoo, and be gentle. Here is a list of the dos and don&#39;ts. Take care now, little one, and behave&#34;, the Doctor tells us. We thank the Doctor and leave the room with Lilani in a wheelchair. Once everything was settled at the hospital, they walked to the waiting car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro helps Lilani into the car and then asks Piero to take the wheelchair. Lilani lay with her head on my lap and immediately fell asleep. As we get closer, I wake Lilani. &#34;We are almost there, Lilani.&#34; Linani wakes up, rubbing her eyes. She sits up and looks around. Lilani&#39;s eyes get huge when we ride through the gates. &#34;Wow, this is a palace, Lisa. Look at the fountain and flowers. There must be real fairies here. Lilani said with administration. Piero opens the door for us, and Alessandro gets out first, followed by Lilani and me. I take both of them by the hand and walk to the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Sophia, Gabriele, Grandma, and Grandpa are already waiting for Lilani. I sent them a text to let them know we were already there. When Lilani notices everyone in the living room, she immediately hides behind me. &#34;Lilani, I would like to introduce you to my sister-in-law Sophia and brother-in-law Gabriele, as well as grandma and grandpa.&#34; I say as I bend down</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to Lilani. Lilani peed at the people and then came out from behind me. &#34;Your name sounds like Princess Sophia. I always watch,&#34; Lilani giggles and then continues,  &#34;Hello auntie, and uncle,&#34; Lilani greets them. Alessandro introduces Lilani to everyone, &#34;Let&#39;s get you to bed. We can celebrate your homecoming after you have rested&#34;. Lilani slowly nods and takes my hand. Gabriele went to Alessandro&#39;s side and helped him, and then everyone followed Lilani and me to her room; Lilani&#39;s room is big; it&#39;s painted pink with princesses on the wall, and she has a double house bunk bed that looks like a real dollhouse with pink and purple duvet covers, her very own mirror and a study table. She even has her flat-screen TV, a big chest with many toys, and a massive wardrobe with clothes. Lilani turns around, walks to Alessandro, and hugs him around his legs, &#34;Thank you, Ali, this is the prettiest room I ever had. Are you absolutely certain that you are not a prince? Lilani exclaims with joy. Alessandro bursts into laughter and exclaims. &#34;It&#39;s a pleasure, I am glad you like it, and no, I am not a prince, little one.&#34; While we were busy in Lilani&#39;s room, Antonio came and informed us that the nurse had arrived. Alessandro asked Sophia if she could watch Lilani then he and I went to the nurse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take Alessandro to his seat and stand next to him. Alessandro starts to talk in a cold, stern tone, &#34;You are here to take care of my little sister; she is five years old and just had brain surgery. Here is a list of what you will need. I expect you to follow every instruction on that paper. Her sister will accompany her for chemo treatments. I have no patience for individuals who arrive late for work. It is imperative that you prioritize the well-being of Lilani, leaving no room for excuses. Is there anything you like to ask?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Mr. Mancini, you and your sister don&#39;t have to worry; I will take good care of your sibling.&#34; With a sweet smile, the nurse addresses Alessandro. &#34;Lisa is not my sister; she is my wife&#34; Alessandro sets her straight with a deep frown. &#34;You will listen to Mrs. Mancini; you will report to her; now that this is settled, you know we are the Mancinis; please tell us your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mr. Mancini, I understand. My name is Viola Lastra,&#34; The nurse says, shocked that he&#39;s married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After this, Alessandro dismisses us. I walk with Viola to her room, where the staff stays. &#34;Dinner is served at 19:00 hours; please let the chef know when you don&#39;t have dinner with us. I will introduce my sister to you after she wakes up.&#34; I informed her. With that, I went to my room.</p>
