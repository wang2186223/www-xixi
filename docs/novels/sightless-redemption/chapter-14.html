                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few days have passed since Lilani came home. I help her with bathing and try to keep her in bed as much as possible. She needs to rest a lot and must try not to do any running or activities that can cause her to go back to the hospital. It seems that Lilani is getting better day by day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, I take Lilani back to her room, give her medication, and tuck her into bed. &#34;Can you please read me a story?&#34; Lilani asked me. &#34;Shall we delve into the enchanting tale of Cinderella?&#34; I suggest. Lilani nods and lays down; soon she falls fast asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to go and look for Sophia. As I walk down the stairs, Viola suddenly talks behind me, &#34;Oh, hi, Mrs. Mancini, do you know where I can find Mr. Mancini?&#34; She asks sweetly. &#34;He&#39;s usually in his office,&#34; I told her with a frown. Viola nods and skips the stairs one by one. That&#39;s weird? Why does she need to talk to him? I wonder and continue to walk downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am glad your sister is back home; she&#39;s such a lovely girl,&#34; Sophia says. &#34;Thank you; I&#39;m also glad she&#39;s home; my life will be dull without her. I promised our parents that I would protect her, and when we found out about the tumor, my world suddenly stopped,&#34; I told her. &#34;You know you are one strong woman, Lisa; I hope you realize it,&#34; Sophia says with admiration in her eyes. &#34;Thank you; I need to be. I&#39;m the only one Lilani has.&#34; I replied and sat next to Sophia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat there and talked for a while before I excused myself, saying, &#34;I&#39;m going to check up on Lilani; see you later.&#34; Sophia nods, and I walk up to Lilani&#39;s room. &#34;Hi sweetie, How are you feeling&#34;? I ask her as soon as I notice she&#39;s awake. &#34;I am doing okay, thank you. I&#39;m just hungry, Lisa.&#34; I hear her say &#34;Then let us go and make you something to eat, or you can stay here and I will bring you something&#34;. With a shake of her head, Lilani slowly gets up and takes my hand. When we went into the kitchen, Maria told us lunch was ready and we could go to the table. When they walk over to the table, I notice Viola already sitting at the table on my chair. I frown but don&#39;t say anything. Alessandro entered the dining room, and Lilani went up to him to hug him, saying, &#34;Hi Ali, how are you doing?&#34; Alessandro bent down to hug her. &#34;Hello, Principessa, I am good. Thank you. How are you feeling?&#34; Lilani guides Alessandro to his seat. Lilani looked at Viola and said, &#34;Can you please move up? I want to sit next to Ali&#34;, Viola just stares at her and doesn&#39;t move. Lilani then got on Alessandro&#39;s lap and whispered something in his ears. Alessandro&#39;s tone grew icy as he confronted Miss Viola, reminding her, &#34;Earlier today, I made it clear to you in my office that I have absolutely no tolerance for anyone who exceeds their boundaries within this household. That chair you&#39;re sitting on belongs to my wife, and Antonio has already discussed this with you. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate it if you could kindly vacate the chair.&#34; With a small yes, Viola takes another open chair. She&#39;s fuming with embarrassment. I just shake my head and sit down. Lilani sits on Alessandro&#39;s lap, and it doesn&#39;t seem that it&#39;s bothering him. Lunch was quiet, it was just Alessandro and Lilani, who were talking the whole time. After lunch, Alessandro takes Lilani&#39;s hand and asks me to take them out to the backyard. &#34;Your duty starts tomorrow morning; this is my sister Lilani. You are excused for the rest of the day&#34;. Alessandro informs Viola. The three of us then went outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait here, I&#39;m just going to get a blanket for us,&#34; I tell them, and I quickly go to get a blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We went down to the beach and sat under a tree. Lilani lay with her head on Alessandro&#39;s lap. &#34;Let&#39;s play a game,&#34; Lilani says. Alessandro smiles and asks, &#34;What do you want to play?&#34; Lilani&#39;s gaze shifts from Alessandro to me. &#34;I don&#39;t know; I can&#39;t play hide-and-seek because my sister will scold me when I run,&#34; Lilani explains, throwing her hands in the air. &#34;How about you tell me what the shape of the clouds looks like?&#34; Alessandro makes a suggestion, and Lilani happily tells him. &#34;Thank you, Ali&#34;. Lilani speaks out of the blue. Alessandro bends down and kisses her on the head, then he starts to tickle her. Lilani&#39;s laughter can be heard for miles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Third-person POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere in the mansion, Viola watches the whole scene as well. &#34;He can smile for them but treats me like dirt.&#34; Viola is seething with anger. &#34;I have to get Alessandro and all of his money.&#34; With an evil smile, Viola starts to think of a plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are still outside, with Lilani asleep on Alessandro&#39;s lap. He gently plays with her hair and says, &#34;I have to go away for a few days; there&#39;s an important matter that needs my attention. I will be back before the weekend.&#34; I suddenly become sad and answer softly, &#34;We will be fine; when are you leaving?&#34; Alessandro takes my hand and says, &#34;Tomorrow morning, just after breakfast, if you need anything, don&#39;t hesitate to call me or Antonio.&#34; We sit for a while when Lilani wakes up. I take Alessandro to his office and Lilani to her room to take a bath. Lilani enjoys this big bathtub. After giving her a bath, I assist her in washing her hair. Once we finish, Lilani puts on a stylish denim jumpsuit paired with her black Vans. Her hair was shortened due to the surgical procedure, adding a unique touch to her overall appearance. &#34;You know you still look beautiful even with your hair short,&#34; I tell her. Lilani smiles at me, then frowns. &#34;Lisa, that Viola girl, I don&#39;t think I like her; she looks at Ali weird, and I don&#39;t like it.&#34; I smile at her possessiveness towards Alessandro and carefully say, &#34;Give her a chance; maybe she isn&#39;t as bad as you think she is.&#34; I&#39;m filled with uncertainty as I observe Viola&#39;s unwavering gaze on Alessandro throughout the entire day. Deep inside, I yearn to confront Viola and demand that she stay away from my husband. However, I find myself incapable of doing so, for our relationship is nothing more than a contractual marriage. Lilani took my hand, and we went out. We spent time with Grandma and Grandpa. I can see they love Lilani. &#34;Grandma, will you read me a bedtime story tonight, please?&#34; I hear Lilani asking. &#34;I would love to read you a story.&#34; Grandma smiles. &#34;Mrs. Mancini, dinner is ready.&#34; Maria appears. &#34;Thank you, Maria,&#34; I say, and we go to the table. The whole dinner, everyone seems busy with their thoughts; it&#39;s just Lilani who asks a lot of questions to the people around the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone loves and adores Lilani, except for one person, Viola. It seems that Viola doesn&#39;t have a liking for me or my sister. &#34;I see you and Alessandro don&#39;t sleep in the same bed&#34;, Viola suddenly says behind me, where I&#39;m busy doing the dishes. &#34;I am completely unaware of what you are referring to, Miss Viola. Furthermore, the matters concerning my husband and I are entirely unrelated to you. I kindly request that you refrain from interfering in our personal affairs and focus solely on fulfilling your professional obligations.&#34; I firmly express my displeasure. Viola gazes at me, wearing a mischievous smirk, as she declares, &#34;Oh, my dear, it will be my utmost priority. You and your troublesome sister should prepare yourselves for imminent departure, as soon as I claim Alessandro.&#34; I can&#39;t help but burst into laughter at the absurdity of her delusion; it&#39;s so funny that tears begin to well up. &#34;What&#39;s going on in here? Lisa, are you alright?&#34; Alessandro&#39;s deep voice comes from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could answer, Viola said in a teary voice, &#34;Mrs. Mancini just hit me in the face and told me to stay away from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa, come to my office now!&#34;, Alessandro commands. Viola smirks as I help Alessandro to his office. I wish I could wipe that smirk off her face. Once inside, Alessandro says in a cold voice, &#34;Don&#39;t you dare hit any of my employees again; you may be married to me, but I am still the boss. Do I make myself very clear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just stared at Alessandro with tears in my eyes. I compose myself before saying, &#34;One, I did not touch her; two, she is the one who said she noticed that we don&#39;t share a bed; and lastly, she will make sure you divorce me and kick me and my brat of a sister out, so don&#39;t you dare talk to me that way again without listening to my side of the fucking story; if you will excuse me now, I need to go and take my sister to bed.&#34; But before Alessandro could say anything, I walked out, slamming the door behind me.</p>
