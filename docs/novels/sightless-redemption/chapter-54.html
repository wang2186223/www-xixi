                <p>I I would love to go away for a few days with you.&#34; Alessandro is relieved when he hears her say those words. Sophia winks at him then says to Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember what I told you.&#34; With a nod, Lisa gracefully makes her way towards Alessandro. He takes her hand and leads her to the waiting jet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for agreeing; you don&#39;t know how much this means to me. By the way, you look absolutely stunning.&#34; Alessandro compliments her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I know how much this means to you,&#34; Lisa tells him. The flight attendant warmly welcomes them. Lisa noticed it was a new one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder what happened to the other one.&#34; Lisa thought that until she heard Alessandro&#39;s answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I fired her just after we came back from South Africa. This is Aurora. Aurora, this is my wife Lisa.&#34; Lisa looks at Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I just say that out loud?&#34; Lisa thought. &#34;Yes, you did.&#34; Alessandro smiles. Lisa blushes because of her stupidity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pleasure to finally meet you, Lisa; the guys talk about you a lot.&#34; Aurora greets Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, you know them?&#34; Lisa asks her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a long story, but yes, I know them. I&#39;m just helping Alessandro out on this trip until he can find another girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, okay. A pleasure to meet you too.&#34; Lisa kindly said Alessandro leads them to the seats and fastens Lisa&#39;s safety belt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She smells so good&#34;. Alessandro thought and concentrated hard not to kiss her. He needs to take things slow with her. Lisa notices how hard Alessandro tries not to touch her. It&#39;s funny, especially his face. Lisa tries to hold her laughter; she needs to let him work for her forgiveness. Aurora comes and tells them they are about to take off, and soon the plane is in the air. She wonders where they are going but doesn&#39;t want to ask Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro noticed Lisa sleeping; he picked her up and went to lay her down on the bed. &#34;Stay with me.&#34; He hears her say Alessandro takes his shoes off and lies down next to her. Lisa turned to him and moved into his arms, falling asleep again. Alessandro smiles and then closes his eyes. Lisa woke up needing to use the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro, I need to go to the bathroom.&#34; She whispers, but Alessandro keeps on sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro Mancini! Your kids are pressing on my bladder! If you don&#39;t let go of me, I&#39;m going to pee in this bed.&#34; Alessandro let her go, and Lisa quickly ran to the bathroom. After she&#39;s finished, she goes back and finds Alessandro waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;May I take you out on a date?&#34; He asks her Lisa smiles and says, &#34;Of course you can, but we are still in the air.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luckily for you and me, I have a personal chef on this plane.&#34; Alessandro brags, then takes Lisa&#39;s hand and leads her to the seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I get you anything, Mr. Mancini?&#34; Aurora plays along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I get a bottle of your best champagne?&#34; Alessandro asked. Aurora went to the kitchen and came back with champagne and classes. Lisa and Alessandro enjoy their dinner date. Lisa hasn&#39;t laughed so much in a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a few more hours before we land. When you feel tired, you can go to the bedroom.&#34; Alessandro tells her. Lisa nods but decides to sit down next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for a lovely dinner. I enjoyed it.&#34; Lisa   truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will do anything to make you smile.&#34; He whispers, then plants a kiss on her cheek. They sat and chatted for a while when Lisa yawned, &#34;I think I&#39;m going to rest for a while.&#34; Alessandro nods and lets her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa, honey, wake up; we are about to land.&#34; She hears Alessandro speaking. Lisa woke up and then followed him to fasten her seat belt. When the plane lands, Alessandro and Lisa walk out of the plane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we in Hawaii?&#34; Lisa asks Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I remember it was on the list you gave me when we went on honeymoon.&#34; Alessandro smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, I&#39;m sincerely grateful,&#34; Lisa expresses with genuine appreciation. They walk to a waiting car, and Alessandro tells the driver where to take them. It&#39;s half-past two in the morning. Lisa looks out of the window and notices how beautiful everything looks, even if it is dark. The car stops in front of a huge house. Alessandro opened the door for her, then went to the driver and paid him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aloha, welcome to beautiful Hawaii,&#34; Alessandro warmly greets. Lisa smiles at him, then starts walking towards the house. Alessandro opens the door and watches Lisa&#39;s reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This place is huge; it&#39;s got so much space,&#34; Lisa said, expressing her thoughts out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t tell me this is one of your properties as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s Kevin&#39;s property. He told me I could use it for a few days.&#34; Alessandro replies to her. Lisa walks further inside; one side of the wall is all made out of glass, giving her the perfect view of the ocean. The entire first floor is an open design with a dining table and what she assumes is a lounge area. She walks to the door leading to the balcony and opens it. Lisa turns around and notices Alessandro watching her every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go outside for a bit.&#34; She asks him. Alessandro walked up to her, and then they both went out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa exclaims, &#34;The view is absolutely stunning!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not as beautiful as the sight in front of me.&#34; Lisa turns around to face Alessandro. She stands on her toes and throws her arms around his neck then pulls him closer to her. The kiss is passionate, and after a while, they break the kiss both catching their breaths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wanted to say thank you for bringing me here,&#34; Lisa tells him. She notices the disappointment in his eyes. She then takes him by the hand, &#34;Show me the bedroom.&#34; Alessandro leads her upstairs and opens the door. Lisa watched as Alessandro walks into the bedroom and puts their bags in the corner of the room. He takes something out of his back and then takes his shirt off. Lisa&#39;s mouth went dry at the sight of her husband&#39;s body. As if her feet have a mind of their own, she walks up to him and puts her hands on his naked body, tracing his six-pack with her nails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro holds her hands and whispers in her ear, &#34;If you don&#39;t stop doing that, I will take you right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa looks up at him and says, &#34;Maybe that&#39;s what I want.&#34; Alessandro raises an eyebrow, asking, &#34;Are you sure that&#39;s what you want?&#34; Lisa grabs his face and starts kissing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You talk too much.&#34; That&#39;s all Alessandro wanted to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently places her in the middle of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands run up her inner thigh pushing up her dress. He impatiently pulls it over her head. When she&#39;s free of the dress, he sits back and stares down at her. After what feels like forever he let out a groan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any idea what you have been doing to me all night?&#34; He shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Driving me crazy.&#34; He leans down, kisses her down her neck, making sure the only part of him touching her is his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So sexy,&#34; he mummers against her skin, causing more heat to bloom low in her belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro&#34;. She says it breathlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MMM&#34;. He moans against her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please&#34;. She gasps as his tongue twirls against her nipple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please what?&#34; He sucks it into his mouth, and she arches her back, gasping. He lets it go, smirking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please what?&#34; He repeats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need...&#34; He sucks on the other one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Need what?&#34; He continues his tortured licks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Need you Need you. Now.&#34; Alessandro looks up at her and grins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you wish.&#34; True to his word, he does everything she wishes and more. They spent the night tangled with each other. Exploring in ways they never had before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa woke up to the demands of her bladder. Alessandro spoons her, his arms protectively around her waist. When she moves, he groans and pulls her tighter against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro&#34;. She whispers. He rubs his head into her hair, ignoring her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro&#34;. She says it again, this time louder. Nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro, I have to pee.&#34; She says it louder. His body starts shaking with laughter, and he rolls off her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jerk&#34;. She says this before running to the bathroom.</p>
