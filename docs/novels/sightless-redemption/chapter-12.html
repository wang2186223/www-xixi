                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been three days since the operation. Everything has been going well with Lilani. The biopsy came back negative, which I&#39;m thankful for. The guy responsible for the attack has received a life sentence after more women came forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia told Gabriele that they were expecting, Gabriele was over the moon when he heard the news, and now Sophia&#39;s not allowed to do anything. Lately, he has been distant and treating me with unnecessary rudeness. They are leaving one of these days, then it&#39;s just me, Alessandro, and his grandparents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t wait to go to the hospital; I got up early to shower and dress. Walking down, I notice Alessandro standing at the bottom of the stairs. I can&#39;t help but admire my handsome husband; he looks hot, even in a black shirt and blue jeans. I have never seen him in something other than his suits. When I reach the bottom, I greet Alessandro. &#34;I&#39;m going with you to see your sister,&#34; Alessandro says. I took him by the arm and led him to the waiting car. &#34;I know you&#39;re a busy man; you don&#39;t always have to go with me,&#34; I say after a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, but I can stand some time off to accompany you to your sister; I know today is the day they will wake her up,&#34; Alessandro says. I decide to keep quiet because I know there&#39;s no point in arguing with this man. Once we reached the hospital, I led Alessandro to my sister&#39;s room. When we went inside, Dr. Dorigo was already there. &#34;Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Mancini; you are just in time; we are about to wake the little one. You can wait outside, or if you prefer to stay here, it&#39;s up to you&#34;. The Doctor kindly says. &#34;We will stay,&#34; comes the answer from Alessandro. I keep quiet and watch the Doctor go to work. Once the doctor completes his work, he turns and confidently declares, &#34;The awakening process typically lasts around twelve hours, although this may vary depending on the patient. Rest assured, everything appears to be proceeding smoothly. As soon as your sister has fully regained consciousness, we will promptly notify you without delay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Doctor, I would appreciate it,&#34; I happily say. The Doctor writes something down, greets us, and leaves. &#34;I&#39;m eagerly looking forward to hearing her voice again. I truly long to be reunited with her. Alessandro, I extend my deepest appreciation to you and your grandparents, for without your support, my sister wouldn&#39;t have had another chance at life.&#34; I express my gratitude, realizing the immense impact they have had on Lilani&#39;s survival. &#34;You don&#39;t have to thank me, Lisa; it was all my grandma&#39;s doing.&#34; Alessandro has replied. I say nothing and softly stroke my sister&#39;s hand. &#34;Hi Lilly, by tomorrow, you will be awake again; I can&#39;t believe you will be alright; it still feels like a dream. I will see you as soon as you&#39;re awake. Remember, I love you&#34;, I softly say. After I kissed her, Alessandro and I left the hospital. In the car, Alessandro says, &#34;We are going to the store to buy things for your sister&#39;s room and clothes for when she comes home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up at him, &#34;Thank you&#34; was all I could say at that moment. We spent the next four hours shopping for Lilani. It was a struggle at first because Alessandro couldn&#39;t see, and I must describe everything; I must admit he has good taste even though he is blind. Once we arrive home, Alessandro asks Antonio to take everything to the room where Lilani will sleep. Alessandro then excused himself and went to his office. I decided to cook a traditional South-African dinner. With that thought, I went to the kitchen to inform the chef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to cook &#34;Vetkoek&#34; and mince and for dessert a Malva pudding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro was quiet during dinner. Sophia and I talked about her pregnancy, and later Gabriele joined in. &#34;This was very delicious, Lisa; you are a great cook,&#34; Gabriele compliments. &#34;Thank you,&#34; I reply. I got up to take the dishes and said, &#34;I made some dessert. I will bring it now.&#34; I went to the kitchen and set the plates in the sink, then I started serving the dessert and took it to the table. Everyone enjoys the dessert as they make sounds every time they bite. &#34;Wow, that was delicious; what do you call the dinner we had, Lisa?&#34; Grandma asks. &#34;Oh, it&#39;s called &#34;Vetkoek&#34; and mince,&#34; I tell her with a smile. &#34;That reminds me of our traditional bread, Gnocco fritto,&#34; Gabriele says after finishing his dessert. Alessandro surprised me when he asked, &#34;Can I please have some more?&#34; I quickly went to get him a second serving. When I placed it in front of him. &#34;I have to admit this is the best dessert I have had in ages; thank you, Lisa.&#34; Alessandro says. We all talked for a while. After our delicious dinner, Antonio kindly escorted Alessandro to his room, while I took on the task of washing the dishes. &#34;Lisa, my dear, you know you don&#39;t have to handle the dishes each and every time,&#34; Grandma lovingly reminded me as she stands next to me. &#34;It&#39;s alright, Grandma; I like doing the dishes.&#34; I smile at her. &#34;Alright, my dear. Here let me help you.&#34; The two of us quickly cleaned the kitchen. &#34;Thank you, Grandma; I&#39;m going to shower and get ready for bed,&#34; I tell Grandma. &#34;Okay, my dear, I think I&#39;m going to call it a night as well,&#34; Grandma says, and we both leave the kitchen. I feel my body relax as the water hits my body. I think of Alessandro&#39;s weird behavior; one minute, he is friendly, then the next, he is like a ticking time bomb. I wish this was a normal marriage, where he would hold my hand and tell me how much he loves me, take me out for dinner, or order pizza, and we lay in each other&#39;s arms, but sadly it&#39;s not. He will never love me; he only loves one woman. I must stop hoping for something more and concentrate on Lilani. After the shower, I put on a short and a T-shirt. I then decide to watch a movie as it is still early. Just as I&#39;m about to decide what to watch, there&#39;s a knock on my door; with a soft come-in, Antonio opens the door. &#34;Mrs. Mancini, the hospital called; your sister is awake; Mr. Mancini says you must get ready. I will wait at the car.&#34; Antonio tells me. &#34;Thank you, Antonio. &#34;I will change quickly.&#34; As soon as Antonio left, I wasted no time getting dressed. I effortlessly slipped into my sleek pair of skinny jeans and adorned myself with a stylish check shirt, perfectly matched with my blue sandals. Without wasting a second, I hurriedly made my way to the car. However, as I stepped inside, an overwhelming wave of astonishment washed over me - for there, seated inside, was none other than Alessandro. &#34;You didn&#39;t think I was going to send you alone, did you?&#34; With a sudden spark of amusement, he asks. I&#39;m certain this man is bipolar. &#34;How did you know I was shocked?&#34; I asked, surprised. Alessandro simply responded, &#34;Normally, I don&#39;t accompany you. So, when I retired to my room after dinner, it&#39;s likely you assumed I was asleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, um, thank you,&#34; I reply.</p>
