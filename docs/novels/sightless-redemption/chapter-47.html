                <p>After work, Alessandro tells Bianca to meet him at the penthouse and walks to his private elevator. He thinks about Lisa and their child and how he&#39;s going to miss out on every doctor&#39;s appointment. He knows this is his fault, but he doesn&#39;t have another option. He wishes he could be with them, but he has to protect his family until he can find Mr. Lombardi. He doesn&#39;t notice someone following him the next moment; everything is dark, and he gets shoved into a van.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We got him, boss&#34;. Alessandro hears a guy say it as he struggles to untie himself. He needs to get out of there. What if they go after Lisa? They suddenly stop, and he hears the door open, and then someone takes him out of the van.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well, look who came to visit us&#34;. He hears a familiar voice. Suddenly the bag is taken off his head, and he sees all three of his best friends standing in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know there are other ways to get to me?&#34; He asks them with an angry expression. He doesn&#39;t know why they had to do something like that to get his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but that Bitch is always with you, so we decided to kidnap you,&#34; Jake shrugs. How were they supposed to get him without Bianca lurking around? They did what they thought was best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you do this? Bianca is waiting for me, and if I don&#39;t show up on time, she&#39;s going to get suspicious.&#34; He tells them, as he desperately wants to get out of this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s cut to the chase and tell us what&#39;s going on.&#34; Johnny demands. He knows that someone must threaten Alessandro, but he wants to hear it from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro sighs and rubs his frustrated face. &#34;A few weeks ago, I received photos of Lisa and proof that she is pregnant; they threatened me that if I didn&#39;t do as they said, they would kill my family. I know Lombardi is behind this, but to prove it and to find him, I have to get close to Bianca.&#34; Alessandro explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you couldn&#39;t come to one of us because?&#34; Kevin mocks as he looks at his idiot of a friend. &#34;My office and house are full of listening devices; that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t talk to you guys, and I think they are watching my every move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you just tell Lisa? She&#39;s taking this very hard. She doesn&#39;t eat or sleep. It&#39;s not good for the baby. She deserves to know the truth&#34;! Jake yells, not caring if everyone around them can hear, but Alessandro needs to know how much this is effecting Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I fucking know; I know I saw her. I saw the hurt in her eyes, but if I go back, they will hurt her, and I don&#39;t think I can live without her knowing I could have prevented something from happening to her. Don&#39;t you see how hard this is for me?&#34; Alessandro sights. Johnny looks at him and can see the hurt in his friend&#39;s eyes. He knows Alessandro is telling the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What can we do to help?&#34; Alessandro was approached by Jonny. After all, he is still their friend, and right now he needs their help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to trace the emails I received, and I need more bodyguards to watch Lisa. I can&#39;t seem to find the location of the email server, so I need to get Bianca on my side to get her to tell me where her father is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On it, it sent everything to me, and make sure you delete all traces,&#34; Jake tells Alessandro. Alessandro nods. He knew he must have come to them in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I go now? Before Bianca sent someone to track me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but only if you assure me that you will completely resolve any issues with Lisa.&#34; Jonny replied. To be honest he doesn&#39;t want Alessandro to end up alone or worse with Bianca. Lisa was perfect for his friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise I will go to her soon and explain everything. Please, make sure to keep a careful eye on her.&#34; Jonny nods his head and promises to look after Lisa and protect her. One of the guys takes Alessandro back to his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, we need to track Lombardi down before he can harm Lisa and the baby. We just need to focus on getting every man you have and send them to the places Lombardi could be. We have to find him quickly before it&#39;s too late.&#34; Johnny tells the other two. Kevin and Jake nod, then go to Johnny&#39;s home to start tracing Lombardi. Johnny went to see Lisa and Lilani. Once he got there and saw that the door was open, he quickly got his gun and walked towards the open door. He gently opened the door and went inside quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole house is in a mess; it looks like someone was putting up a fight. He went from room to room, then found Alice unconscious on the floor, ran-up to her and felt for a pulse. He then takes out his phone and dials Kevin s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys should get here asap. Lisa and Lilani are gone, and Alice needs a doctor. I&#39;m taking her, and I want you to check for any leads&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How the hell did this happen? We are on our way. Is Alice alright?&#34; Kevin asked as soon as he heard what Johnny said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has been shot. I&#39;m on my way to the hospital. I will let you know as soon as I know what&#39;s going on&#34;. Johnny says he&#39;s ending the call and driving to the hospital. He was mad that none of them were there to protect Lisa and Lilani.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone, please help this lady who has been shot!&#34; He shouts as soon as he steps into the hospital. A nurse comes running to him and helps Alice into bed. Soon a doctor comes and pushes Alice to the emergency room. The nurse came and took Alice&#39;s details, and Johnny tried to fill in everything he knew about her. After the paperwork is done, Johnny takes his phone and dials Alessandro&#39;s number, but it goes to voice mail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck Mancini, where are you&#34;? Johnny wonders. He decided to wait in the waiting area until the doctors were done. Jake and Kevin are at the house looking for answers. A few hours later, the doctor appears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The family of Mrs. Bruno?&#34; The doctor asked, and Johnny quickly got up, praying that Alice was alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am her son; is she going to be alright?&#34; Johnny asked, concerned, as he stood in front of the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We managed to get the bullet out. She is very lucky because a few centimeters further, it would have penetrated her heart. She is in intensive care; you can visit her as soon as she is awake.&#34; The doctor informs him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor, I am truly grateful for your assistance.&#34; Johnny shakes the doctor&#39;s hand and then asks the nurse at the station to call him once Alice wakes up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly walks out of his car and starts driving towards Alice&#39;s home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is Alice? Is she going to be alright?&#34; Kevin asks as soon as Johnny steps inside the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, she&#39;s going to be fine. I ask some of my men to keep guard; I don&#39;t want anyone to harm her if they find out she&#39;s not dead. Did you find anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, we are still looking. Have you informed Mancini?&#34; Jake asked as he went through some of the security footage from across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny shakes his head, replying, &#34;It goes straight to voicemail.&#34; Soon everyone starts to call around, hoping someone knows something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After midnight, they hear a knock on the front door, and Johnny walks up to the door and opens it, hiding his gun. &#34;Johnny, what are you doing here?&#34; Alessandro asked, confused as soon as he noticed his friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If your phone wasn&#39;t off, you would have known that Alice is in the hospital fighting for her life, and there&#39;s no trace of Lisa or Lilani&#34;. Johnny says it angrily as he glares at Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My phone wasn&#39;t off; I have it here with me. Wait, did you just say that Lisa is missing?&#34; Alessandro was shocked as he realized what Johnny had just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, come in; we are just trying to figure out where and who took them&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro went inside and saw the mess. He prays that Lisa and Lilani are okay, wherever they are. He feels so stupid. Why didn&#39;t they just leave them alone? His grandparents are going to kill him when they find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Lisa and Lilani are tied-up in a dark room. Lisa wakes up with some liquid running down her face. She tries to remember what happened, and then she hears Lilani cry. Lisa looks around in the darkroom to find her sister, but with no luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, guess who finally decides to join the land of the living.&#34; Lisa hears the familiar voice, and fear starts to build up. She knows how dangerous this guy is. She can only hope and pray that someone will find them on time.</p>
