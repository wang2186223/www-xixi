                <p>Everyone sits around the dining table curious why Alessandro wants to talk to them so urgently. &#34;Ali!&#34; Lilani greets him as soon as he enters the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, little one.&#34; He went and kissed her on the head then looked around the table and noticed everyone he cares about is there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Maria, this looks delicious.&#34; Maria smiles at her boss. This was one of Lisa&#39;s favorite Lisa has shown her how to make &#34;vetkoek&#34; and mince. No one talks during dinner, everyone is wondering what Alessandro wants to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, Alessandro asks them to follow him to the living room. &#34;Thank you all for coming. What I&#39;m about to say will come as a shock to you but no one must know about this.&#34; Alessandro looks at them, and they nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well first thing, I&#39;m taking you all to a safe house. Bianca wants to hurt everyone close to me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; Gabriele interrupts. Alessandro gives him a look to shut up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As I was explaining, Bianca hired someone to kill Lisa and our boys, but it turns out she&#39;s still alive.&#34; He pauses for a second to let his words sink in then continues to tell them about everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O my!&#34; Sophia gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That Bitch! I will kill her myself!&#34; Sophia continues to shout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...yo ....you mean my prayers came true?&#34; Alessandro and the rest turn to Lilani. He wanted to tell her in private he didn&#39;t realize she was hiding behind the couch. Alessandro walks over to her and picks her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Lisa is alive, but she may not remember us. So we need to help her.&#34; Alessandro tries to explain to the little girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When are we leaving?&#34; Grandpa asks shocked at what he heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow morning I want everyone ready at 4 O Clock.&#34; They nod and stand up to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See you all tomorrow morning.&#34; With that Gabriele and Sophia left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s going to watch over the house and clean it?&#34; Maria asked concerned that the house would be left alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will hire someone to come and clean it regularly until we can come back. Don&#39;t worry. All of you should go and rest tomorrow is going to be a long day.&#34; Antonio, Leonardo, and Maria say goodbye, and leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilani and Alessandro went up to the triplets where Alice is watching them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alice? I need to talk to you as well.&#34; Alice looks up at Alessandro and notices how tired he&#39;s looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong dear child?&#34; Alice asks concerned. Alessandro takes her hand and leads her to the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are all leaving tomorrow morning early to a safe house,&#34; Alessandro tells her exactly what he told the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, my dear Lord.! That&#39;s bad! Oh my, I can&#39;t believe she&#39;s still alive.&#34; Alice cries out. Alessandro dismisses her, telling her to be ready early. He takes the triplets with Lilani helping him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we will be sleeping in my room tonight. What do you think?&#34; He asks Lilani.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah! A sleep-over!&#34; Lilani shouted, clapping her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning everyone arrives early and makes their way to the limousine. Alessandro can&#39;t wait to see Lisa again even though she won&#39;t remember him. He looks at everyone around him. This is his family, and he won&#39;t let anything happen to them. Yesterday he and the guys talked about everything that has to be done to keep them safe. Kevin will be joining them later while the other two will locate Bianca and the person she&#39;s working with. Alessandro told them that if they don&#39;t find her in the next few days they must use him as bait to capture her. They all agreed to do that as a last resort but that he must go with his family to meet Lisa. His heartbeat begins to beat fast just thinking that after so long he will finally see her again. His thoughts were interrupted when the car stopped at the airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like forever, the plane finally lifts off. Alessandro went to the bedroom to lay the boys down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soon you guys will get to see your mother again. I promise you that you will never have to go without her this long.&#34; He stares at them thinking how much Lisa missed out during these three months, but knows that if Bianca hired someone else he could&#39;ve lost her and his boys. He stays with them for a while then goes back and notices Lilani sleeping in Gabriele&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will go and lay her down,&#34; Gabriele tells him standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few hours of flying, they finally reached their distinction. Alessandro takes Gabriele and JP while Alice takes Alexander. They followed him to the waiting car while Leonardo went to do all the paperwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they get closer to the house, Alessandro begins to get nervous. How will she react when she sees everyone? Was this a good idea to let them bring her here? All these questions go through his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Mancini? We have arrived.&#34; The driver informs him. He nods and then opens the door. He takes the stroller and puts the boys inside. Taking a big breath he walks towards the house. Just as he was about to knock on the door opened and on the other side, Lisa stands looking at the man in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa can&#39;t believe her eyes. He&#39;s finally here after so long. Yes, she regained her memories two months after the accident. She became suspicious about the man that keeps appearing in her dreams. Initially, she believed he was to blame for the accident, which is why she continues to dream about him. However, she soon came to the realization that if he had caused her harm, she would be experiencing nightmares instead of pleasant dreams. That&#39;s when she started to look him up and saw that he was indeed her husband. Instead of sharing her memories, she chose to remain silent in order to uncover the reason behind being separated from her loved ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa can&#39;t take her eyes off her sexy husband. He had grown a beard and his eyes look like he hasn&#39;t slept in a long time. She has missed him. His touch, his smell everything. Then she looked down, and her eyes went wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The...they have....&#34; Lisa couldn&#39;t speak her eyes went back to Alessandro who was watching her the whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You recognize us, don&#39;t you?&#34; Alessandro whispers as if he&#39;s afraid to talk too loud then realizes it&#39;s just a dream. He steps forward and takes her in his arms slowly.</p>
