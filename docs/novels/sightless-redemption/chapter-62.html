                <p>&#34;Miss? Miss, can you hear me? What is your name?&#34; A woman in white asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her name is Annabelle Jackson, like I told you.&#34; A man she&#39;s never seen before tells the nurse. Why can&#39;t I remember my name? The young lady thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, may I inquire if you two are related?&#34; The nurse asks again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, she&#39;s my sister.&#34; The man tells the nurse while looking at the girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, you almost died on us, but the doctor managed to pull you through. You have been in a coma for a week now.&#34; The nurse tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The doctor will be here shortly to check on you.&#34; With that the nurse left, leaving her and the man alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you are my brother? Do I have any other family?&#34; She asks him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods and says, &#34;Yes, your older brother.&#34; We have a younger sister too, her name is Ariana Jackson she&#39;s twenty-three years old. My name is Sebastian Jackson. I&#39;m thirty-five years old. Our parents died over ten years ago in an accident. I am the one who raised you and Ariana.&#34; Sebastian tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young woman nodded, trying to remember her brother and sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do we live? What did I do for a living?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, we live here in Los Angeles. All three of us live together. You are an accountant at my company and Ariana is the owner of a small flower shop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again she nods. None of this sounds familiar. Just then the doctor makes his appearance. &#34;Good morning, sleeping beauty. I&#39;m Dr. King. I&#39;m glad to see you are back with us. We almost lost you but managed to pull you through. You lost a lot of blood due to the injuries you sustained. You had swelling in your brain. A punctured lung, a few broken ribs, and as you can see a broken leg.&#34; The doctor tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If your brother didn&#39;t bring you in on time, you would have been dead. If everything goes well you can go home tomorrow.&#34; The doctor asks questions and tells the woman it&#39;s normal to have memory loss, but she mustn&#39;t push too hard to remember. She and Sebastian thank the doctor, and then he leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will come back tonight with Ariana. Would you like me to bring you anything?&#34; She shakes her head. She doesn&#39;t know what she likes and whatnot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sebastian tells her to rest a little and promises to see her tonight. The girl closed her eyes feeling tired and fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sebastian, we must be honest with her! She deserves to know the truth!&#34; Sebastian&#39;s sister shouts at him when he told her about the girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I fucking know that Ari! But did you stop for a second to think what will happen once Bianca learns she&#39;s not dead? Bianca has a lot of dangerous men out there and once she finds out Lisa&#39;s still alive, she will send someone else to do the job. Kevin phoned me and told me that Bianca got out of jail and to keep a close eye on her. When I heard she was planning to take her out I made my appearance as an assassin. I couldn&#39;t let three young boys lose their mother! When the time is right I will contact Alessandro.&#34; Sebastian rants on. Ariana realizes her brother is telling the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does Kevin know she&#39;s still alive?&#34; Ariana asks him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we came up with this idea. He needs to find everyone involved who&#39;s trying to kill his friends and the people they love.&#34; He admits. Sebastian is Kevin&#39;s right-hand man here in Los Angeles. Sebastian runs all the businesses here legal and illegal. He knows Ariana has a thing for Kevin, but he doesn&#39;t want his sister to involve with a player who will only break her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are going to visit her tonight. Please don&#39;t say anything about her life before now.&#34; Sebastian says rubbing his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t, but if she finds out you better pray she won&#39;t kill you,&#34; Ariana says. Sebastian nods and dismisses her. He picks up his phone. After a few rings, the person answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kevin, Lisa is awake. Luckily she&#39;s got memory loss but for how long we don&#39;t know.&#34; Sebastian informs Kevin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for letting me know. I don&#39;t think Bianca bought the story about Lisa being dead. I found out she&#39;s going to dig up the grave and have a DNA test done on the corpse. We have to find out who else is involved because she couldn&#39;t have planned all of this alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When are you going to tell Alessandro the truth?&#34; Sebastian asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soon just not now. Bianca has eyes on him and if he gets in touch with Lisa she will do anything to kill her this time.&#34; Sebastian and Kevin discuss what to do when they hang up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope we know what we are doing.&#34; Sebastian thought out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Annabelle, how are you feeling?&#34; Sebastian asks as soon as he enters the hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine thank you.&#34; Lisa notices the girl behind Sebastian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be our younger sister?&#34; Lisa asks her. Ariana steps forward and gasps when she sees how beautiful Lisa is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um Ye Yes, I&#39;m Ariana.&#34; She takes a seat next to Lisa. Lisa and Ariana talk about everything. Lisa is too afraid to ask about her life. She feels like they&#39;re not telling her something but decides not to show that she doesn&#39;t trust them completely. She had a dream about a handsome Italian man with the name Alessandro and that she&#39;s married to him. Lisa reminds herself that it&#39;s only a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should go. You look exhausted from all the chatting. I will come tomorrow with Sebastian to get you.&#34; Lisa hears Ariana say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for visiting me.&#34; Lisa finally said. Ariana and Sebastian kiss her on her head then leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ali! Can you take me to Lisa&#39;s grave?&#34; Lilani asks Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to take fresh flowers and ask her something,&#34; Lilani explains why she wants to visit Lisa. She misses her sister so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, get ready and meet me downstairs,&#34; Alessandro says in a sad tone. It&#39;s been two weeks since Lisa&#39;s death. Alessandro misses her every single moment of every single day. When he went down Lilani was already waiting for him. He takes her hand and leads her to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made a drawing for her. Do you think she will like it?&#34; Alessandro looks at the drawing. It&#39;s a picture of Lilani, him, and the three boys and in the clouds, it looks like Lisa with angel wings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She will love it,&#34; Alessandro says with a smile. When they stop at the graveyard, Alessandro notices a black SUV parked in front of it and then a guy near Lisa&#39;s grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He takes Lilani&#39;s hand and walks inside to the grave and when the man notices Alessandro he quickly walks in another direction. Alessandro finds this strange but decides to leave it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Lisa. I miss you. Last night the tooth fairy came to visit me. I wish you were here to see it. Your babies cry a lot. Jeez, I hope they get bigger, so they can stop crying that much. Ali is doing a great job with them, so I guess you don&#39;t have to worry about them. If you can hear me, will you tell mom and dad I say hello and I love them? OOO before I forget. I made a drawing for you, I hope you love it.&#34; Lilani bent down and whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please if you can, will you come back to Ali? He missed you like crazy. I hear him cry, but he doesn&#39;t know it. I think he&#39;s thinking of joining you somehow.&#34; She stands up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, Lisa.&#34; Lilani turns to Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be under the tree you can talk to her now.&#34; Alessandro watches as Lilani goes to sit under the tree in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put his hand on the headstone. &#34;Baby, I miss you. It&#39;s so hard for me to live without you. I try my best to be the best father to our boys, but I struggle, they need you. They grow up fast. Alexander even smiled at me the other night when he didn&#39;t sleep. JP and Gabriele had a fever a few nights ago. I got so scared if it weren&#39;t for Alice I don&#39;t know what I would have done. I wish you never had to go out to the shop, then you would still be here with us. Tell me how am I supposed to live without you. It feels like I die every day. I love you forever.&#34; Alessandro calls Lilani and they walk to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro notices the SUV still standing there. He quickly let Lilani inside the car walk around and pull away. After coming home he went to his office and phoned Jhonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need your help.&#34;</p>
