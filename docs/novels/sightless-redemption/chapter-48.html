                <p>Lisa looks up at Mr. Lombardi &#34;What the hell do you want, and where is my sister?&#34; She demands to know. She refuses to display any sign of fear toward him. Mr. Lombardi begins to laugh, sending shivers down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stupid little girl, you should have listened to me the first time, and as for your little brat of a sister, she is fine... for now.&#34; He tells Lisa and walks closer to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, as for you, TSK TSK TSK, what should I do with a pregnant woman? You will be no good as a sex slave.&#34; He taunts and continues, &#34;But we can keep you here until you deliver, or maybe we should just get rid of the little bastard inside you?&#34; Mr. Lombardi laughed evilly as he looked at Lisa. He wanted her the first time he laid eyes on her, and now she is right here with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare touch me or my child; Alessandro and I are getting a divorce!&#34; Lisa shouts at him, trying not to show her fear, but deep down inside she is afraid of what he will do to her. Mr. Lombardi slaps her hard across the face, making her head snap to the right as tears prick her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Show some respect, Bitch! Or I will teach you!&#34; Mr. Lombardi seethes through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know Alessandro can fool my daughter, but he can&#39;t fool me&#34;. With that, Mr. Lombardi walks out as Lisa wonders what he was talking about. Lisa tastes the metal of blood in her mouth, then spits the blood out. After a few seconds, the door opened again, and she saw her sister being thrown inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Lombardi says you must enjoy your last few days with each other because soon the little one will have a new house.&#34; The guard laughs as he looks at Lisa, licking his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilani? Are you okay?&#34; Lisa asked, concerned when she saw her sister being handled like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m fine; my arms just hurt from the cuffs they put on me.&#34; Lilani cries. She walks up to Lisa and hugs her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think Ali will find us?&#34; She asks, hopefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know they will find us; don&#39;t worry,&#34; Lisa assures her, hoping and praying that Alessandro will find them before it&#39;s too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilani laid down with her head on Lisa&#39;s lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay? And the baby?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we are both perfectly fine.&#34; Lilani nods, then closes her eyes, and soon she is fast asleep with Lisa watching over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you find anything yet?&#34; Alessandro asks Johnny, walking up and down, trying to figure out where they have taken Lisa and Lilani</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are working on it; we will find them. Make yourself useful and start looking for something to help us&#34;. Johnny tells his friend. Alessandro decides to go to Lisa&#39;s room and start searching there. He then notices a box that has his name written on it and opens it. Inside, he found the sonar picture of today and stared at it. Then it hit him, and tears started to fall down his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise I will find you and bring you back home&#34;. He says it out loud. Then he continued searching, and soon he found the letters Lisa received. He opens them and starts reading them. Alessandro takes the letters and runs to Johnny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think Bianca and her father are in this together.&#34; He shares the information with them and hands over the letters to Johnny. Johnny starts to read each letter and says</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to get Bianca to talk because if we don&#39;t find them soon, we will never see them again.&#34; Alessandro knows what he means and walks away, swearing under his breath. He jumps in his car and heads to the loft. As soon as he stops, he runs inside and presses the code on the elevator. Soon the door opened, and he went inside quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to get rid of them before Alessandro finds out we are behind this.&#34; He hears Bianca&#39;s voice. He walks up to her and stands behind her without her noticing, saying, &#34;I don&#39;t care to sell both of them; next time you call me Daddy, there better be good news.&#34; Bianca ends the call, and as she turns around, she walks into Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, baby, you&#39;re home.&#34; She hesitantly utters the words. &#34;Cut the crap, Bianca; I know what you and your old man did. Now you&#39;re going to tell me exactly what I want to know.&#34; Alessandro says it in a dangerous voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about, baby.&#34; Bianca continues to put on a facade. She won&#39;t let him leave her; she has to make him believe that what he heard was a misunderstanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough with your bullshit! I want to know where Lisa and Lilani are&#34;! Alessandro tells her and walks closer to Bianca. She takes a step back with every step Alessandro takes until her back hits the wall before she can react. Alessandro&#39;s hand comes around her neck, and he starts to squeeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I fucking know what you&#39;re playing at, and I know you and your father have them. I&#39;m going to ask one more time; where is my family!&#34; Alessandro is furious. He let go of her, and Bianca dropped to the floor. She starts laughing hysterically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You... you really think you will find her in time?&#34; She laughs as she looks at Alessandro thinking how pathetic he sounds. &#34;I will find her even if it means that I will have blood on my hands but find them I will!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Why the hell do you love her? She can&#39;t offer you anything. She&#39;s weak, poor, and unattractive!&#34; Bianca shouts angrily because Alessandro loves Lisa and not her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I&#39;m stupid? I know you were only pretending to love me and guess what? I asked my father to sort out my problem! Why can&#39;t you love me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro looks at the woman in front of him and tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She never cared about my wealth; moreover, she supported me unconditionally even when I couldn&#39;t see. And although you may consider her unattractive, she is more breathtaking to me than any other woman on this planet. She doesn&#39;t need fancy clothes or makeup to make her look good! She&#39;s kind and has a pure heart! She possesses all the qualities you are missing!&#34; Alessandro speaks honestly. Alessandro drags her by the hair to a room then he throws her inside and locks the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Antonio I need you to watch over Bianca for me&#34;. Alessandro giving instructions to Antonio. Just as he ends the call his phone rings again this time it&#39;s his brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro you need to come quick! Sophia is in labor!&#34; He hears Gabriele shouting over the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On my way&#34;. Alessandro told him and hung up. He quickly informs Johnny and the rest about Sophia&#39;s situation and Bianca. Then leaves as soon as Antonio arrives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital, Alessandro asked one of the nurses where his brother and sister-in-law are and made his way to the waiting room. After some time he saw Gabriele with a huge smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a girl, Sophia is waiting for you and Kevin will be here soon&#34;. Gabriel informs him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Lisa?&#34; Gabriel asks his brother when he realizes he&#39;s alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t feel very well, but will come as soon as she feels better,&#34; Alessandro says. Gabriel nods and opens the door. Alessandro went inside and kissed Sophia to congratulate her and pick the baby up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s her name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna Aria Mancini.&#34; Gabriel informs him with a big grin plastered on his face. Alessandro looks at his brother and hugs him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia decided to give her mom&#39;s name that way mom will always be remembered,&#34; Gabriele explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you&#34;. Alessandro says, and they all watch over Luna and talk about everything. Alessandro decides not to tell anything about what&#39;s happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s beautiful.&#34; Alessandro compliments as he looks at the baby girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, she looks just like her mother.&#34; Gabriel is beaming with joy. Alessandro excuses himself by telling them he&#39;s got an important meeting. Gabriel senses something wrong but decides not to comment and greets his brother. Alessandro phone Johnny and tell him he&#39;s on his way. When he is about to leave Kevin arrives at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro pleads, &#34;Please refrain from sharing any information about Lisa with them.&#34; Kevin nods and then runs into the hospital leaving Alessandro alone. Alessandro went to his car and started driving to Johnny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wake up Bitch&#34;. Lisa hears someone say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s your lunch the boss will be here soon.&#34; Then the guy leaves. Lisa wakes Lilani gently and shows her the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eat you need it&#34;. Lisa tells her sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about you?&#34;. Lilani asks her as she looks at the plate with one slice of bread on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry I will be fine as long as you eat that&#39;s all that&#39;s matters.&#34; Lilani takes the plate and starts to eat, offering Lisa some food. After Lilani ate, the door opened and Mr. Lombardi steps inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take the little girl to the room next door and leave me alone.&#34; Lilani looks at Lisa afraid to leave her alone. Lisa nods at her sister and Lilani leaves looking at Lisa sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, Alessandro found out that we took you, TSK TSK TSK,&#34; Lombardi says and walks closer to Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to be a good girl and tell him exactly what I tell you to say, or your sister will never live to see another day.&#34; Lisa looks at Mr. Lombardi with fear in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will do it, but please don&#39;t hurt my sister&#34; She begs. Mr. Lombardi shows something to someone then the lights turn on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be a good girl and tell Alessandro to stop searching for you.&#34; Lisa nods and sits up straight. She then sees the camera showing at her and starts talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Mancini, there&#39;s a live feed of Mrs. Mancini,&#34; Leonardo informs him. Alessandro and the other turn to the screen and Alessandro watches Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Alessandro. Please stop searching for us. Now that you have Bianca, embrace your happiness with her. Please, I don&#39;t love you anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro watches Lisa cry, and he knows someone is with her. He knew she won&#39;t say that because he truly believes that she still loves him despite everything he has done to them. As he stares at the screen he sees someone pushing Lisa when she says, &#34;Please find us&#34; and then the screen went blank. &#34;Find and track down the exact location.&#34; Johnny informs Jake. &#34;Already on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were still on a live camera, you fool!&#34; Mr. Lombardi shouts and hits Lisa over and over again. Lisa covers her stomach to protect her children. Soon, she fell unconscious from the blows.</p>
