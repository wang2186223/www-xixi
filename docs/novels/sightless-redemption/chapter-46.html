                <p>Alessandro paces his office up and down. He thinks about what has happened since he went to get Bianca out of the strip club. That day, he was mad when he realized Bianca and her father knew about the baby he and Lisa were expecting. He needed to act fast to keep his family safe until he could get to Mr. Lombardi. He wants to kick himself for all the pain he&#39;s going to cause to keep them safe, and thinking of Bianca and how she suddenly acts around him wants to make him vomit. She would make him breakfast and lunch and bring them to the office. He then realizes that she is just acting and that he only loves Lisa, and he can&#39;t even tell her that he loves her. Now that Lisa is gone with his child, he needs to get her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts were interrupted when his phone rang. &#34;Good morning, Mr. Mancini, I found Mrs. Mancini.&#34; His PI informs him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Send me the address, please.&#34; He tells the PI. After a few minutes, he got the address and called Piero to get the car ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometime later, he arrives at the small house where Lisa lives. He gets out of the car, walks to the door, and knocks. When Lisa opened the door he noticed her eyes were bloodshot, and she got bags under her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; Lisa asks coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to see you, so we can talk.&#34; Alessandro calmly says he wants to take Lisa in his arms and tell her everything is going to be alright, but he needs to be strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing to discuss. I said what I wanted to say. Now if you can, please leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but we need to discuss what happens from here on.&#34; He keeps insisting. Lisa sighs and opens the door for him to come in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice place you got&#34;. Alessandro remarks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Alice&#39;s home. She offered me a place to stay. Now, what do you want to say?&#34; She says it in a cold voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will send you the divorce papers; I will give you enough money so you don&#39;t have to work for the rest of your life; and I want full custody over the child&#34;. He tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haha, are you crazy? I will NEVER let my child go, let alone have anything to do with Bianca.&#34; Lisa laughs at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have an option here; either you give me the baby or I will fight in court for him,&#34; Alessandro tells her in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Why do you want full custody? Why did you do what you did?&#34; She asks him, looking straight into his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I realized that I will only love one woman, and there&#39;s no place for someone else in my heart. Bianca says she will love and take care of the baby as if it was her own. Lisa, please don&#39;t make things more difficult.&#34; With every word, he expresses his heartbreak, seeing Lisa&#39;s hurt on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out and listen carefully over my dead body. I will never give my child up! Now get out of this fucking house&#34;!! Lisa says it through gritted teeth. Alessandro stands up, walks to the door, and looks back to where Lisa stands. Lisa, watch him and don&#39;t break eye contact. She won&#39;t cry in front of him; he will never get that satisfaction. Alessandro just nods and closes the door. After Alessandro closed the door, Lisa fell to the ground and cried. She can&#39;t believe he wants her to give up on her baby. She will never let them take the baby; that&#39;s a promise. Lisa cried her eyes out and then stood up to take a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro can&#39;t seem to get Lisa&#39;s image out of his mind. Every time he closes his eyes, her bloodshot eyes keep popping up. &#34;Baby, are you listening to what I say?&#34; Bianca snaps her finger in front of his face. She wonders what he&#39;s thinking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umm, sorry, I was just thinking about work. What did you say?&#34; Alessandro replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said, when are we going public with our relationship?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As soon as my divorce is over&#34;. Alessandro naturally responds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t wait for the whole world to see we are back together&#34;. Bianca says this while running her fingers over his face. He wants to slap her hands away and tell her that only one woman is allowed to touch him like that, but he can&#39;t without putting Lisa in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did Lisa say when you asked for a divorce today?&#34; Bianca suddenly asks, hoping that Bitch will sign the papers. Alessandro frowns; he didn&#39;t tell her about meeting Lisa today, but he acts quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His response is short and simple: &#34;She will sign the papers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She better do it quickly. I can&#39;t wait to marry you, baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, soon we will be happily married. Now, if you will excuse me, I have a meeting to attend to.&#34; He quickly tells her and leaves the office. Bianca looks at him, wondering why he is so distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonardo can see something is bothering his boss. &#34;Mr. Mancini, we&#39;ve known each other for a long time. You can trust me. What&#39;s bothering you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro runs his hands through his hair and starts telling Leonardo everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you tell Mrs. Mancini the truth then? I am sure she will understand&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t; I won&#39;t put her life in danger; I would not survive if anything happened to her. The love I feel for her is immeasurable.&#34; Alessandro informs him. Leonardo nods; he understands now why Mr. Mancini did what he did. He can tell Mr. Mancini loves Lisa a lot. He wishes there was more he could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t rest until I find Mr. Lombardi.&#34; Alessandro promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa and Lilani are in the park when Lisa notices men watching her. She quickly takes Lilani&#39;s hand and walks as fast as she can to a nearby shop. Once inside, she asks the owner to use his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Johnny, I think someone is following me&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34; He asks. Lisa tells him, and he tells her to stay where she is. He then calls Kevin and Jake to inform them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will be there shortly. I will take some men with me to be on the lookout&#34;, Kevin tells them. Soon, Johnny and Jake found Lisa and took her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you guys; I&#39;m sorry for bothering you.&#34; Lisa apologized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will never bother us, Lisa. You mean so much to us; it&#39;s like having a sister. Jake assures her. Lisa nods and then tells them about everything when they ask why she doesn&#39;t live at the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That fucking bastard!&#34; Johnny shouts. &#34;We told him not to hurt you.&#34; Jake also commented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phone Kevin and tell him to meet us at our usual place&#34;. Johnny says it through gritted teeth. They drop Lisa off and tell her that they will see her later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they arrived at Alessandro&#39;s office, Johnny went up to him and hit him in the face, saying, &#34;That&#39;s for breaking Lisa&#39;s heart, your son of a bitch&#34;!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry, but there are things you guys don&#39;t know that I can&#39;t explain right now,&#34; Alessandro says as he is rubbing his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, so you have a reason for breaking her heart?&#34; Kevin asks, dripping with sarcasm. Just then, Bianca walks in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi guys, What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is none of your business&#34;. Johnny&#39;s voice is ice-cold as he speaks. Bianca looked at them sharply and then went to sit on Alessandro&#39;s lap. They watch Bianca and then walk out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s that stupid!&#34; Kevin says. &#34;I think we must get him alone&#34;. Jake says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How? You saw that the bitch is always with him.&#34; Kevin tells them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got a plan; let&#39;s go&#34;. Johnny tells them and starts explaining. Soon they will know the truth.</p>
