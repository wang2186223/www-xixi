                <p>The following morning, Alessandro and Lisa took a shower together. Alessandro washes her hair and then her back. He spins her around and kisses her, grabbing her ass. Lisa throws her legs around his torso, grabbing his hair. Alessandro slides inside her, then picks up his pace as he slams in and out of her. &#34;O fuck,&#34; Lisa screams. &#34;Oh fuck, baby!&#34; Alessandro screams with every thrust. Soon they both find their release and wash themselves again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are going on a tour this morning; we can grab breakfast at one of the local restaurants&#34;, Alessandro tells Lisa as they get dressed. Lisa turns to Alessandro and notices he&#39;s wearing a khaki short chino with a white V-neck shirt and his van. She stares at him until she hears him say, &#34;Like what you&#39;re seeing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t staring.&#34; With a blush, she vehemently denies it. She must say that he looks damn hot in those clothes. She decides to dress in short denim and a white shirt with her Vans and make her hair in a high ponytail. The two of them then went to the car, where Liam was already waiting for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Mancini.&#34; He greets them with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning, Liam. How are you today?&#34; They both greet him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please take us to Arawak Cay.&#34; Alessandro instructs. Alessandro takes Lisa&#39;s hand and intertwines their fingers, then places a kiss on her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They soon arrive at their destination. Alessandro leads her inside Sky Juice King, and a waiter comes and helps them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome to Sky Juice King. I will be your waiter. What can I get you?&#34; The young waiter proceeds to ask them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;May we please have two refreshing Sky Juices, alcohol-free?&#34; Alessandro asks him. The waiter nods and then leaves to get the order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, this place is awesome,&#34; Lisa comments as she looks around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I usually come here whenever I visit,&#34; Alessandro tells her. The waiter comes back with the drinks, and Alessandro tells him, &#34;Please give us two of your regular burgers.&#34; The waiter writes it down and then leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what do you have planned for today?&#34; Lisa asks him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, after this, we are going hiking at the Primeval Forest National Park&#34;, Alessandro tells her. Soon their food arrives, and they eat in silence. After they are done, Alessandro asks for the bill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They left hand in hand and took a taxi to the park. It took them an hour to get there, as the driver didn&#39;t have a clue where it was. Alessandro paid for them, and soon they joined other visitors waiting for the tour guide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is John, and I will be your tour guide this morning.&#34; Their tour guide announces Everyone follows him as he shows them the different plants and animals. They walked some more when John showed them the sinkholes, which were interesting for Lisa. After hours of exploring, the tour ends, and Alessandro calls Liam to come and fetch them. While they wait for Liam, Alessandro takes Lisa to the local gift shop. There, they bought some souvenirs and went outside. Liam waved at the pair and watched them walk to him. Liam helped put the bags in the car and started driving. Lisa fell asleep on Alessandro&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they reach the Villa, Alessandro gently wakes Lisa. &#34;Lisa, we are back at the Villa.&#34; He tells her Lisa wakes up and then climbs out of the car. Once they are inside, Olivia informs them that their lunch is ready. They sit down and enjoy the lunch Olivia made. After lunch, Lisa asked Alessandro if he wanted to go down to the beach with her. He nodded, and they went to get their swimsuits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa took off her swimming gown, and Alessandro almost choked. &#34;I&#39;m glad I have a private beach; otherwise, I would have been jealous because other guys would have been admiring you,&#34; Alessandro says, his eyes appreciating Lisa&#39;s captivating form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s wearing a black bikini, and it shows off her big breasts. Alessandro feels himself getting hard at the sight of Lisa. Lisa took his hand and took off his shirt. Her breath hitched at the sight of his naked body. His eight-pack on display and that V line She drags him to the water, and they start swimming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro picks her up and then throws her into the water. As Lisa resurfaces, she looks at Alessandro and says, &#34;You&#39;re going to pay for doing that.&#34; She shouts. Trying to catch him, she fails miserably. Alessandro walks up to her from behind and grabs her head, smashing his lips against hers. They start to kiss passionately when Alessandro picks her up and walks to the beach. He pulls her bikini bottom off and pushes his hard cock into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh fuck, Alessandro!&#34; Lisa screams as he thrusts into her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so tight, baby&#34;. He says this as he continues to pound into her. Lisa&#39;s body quivered with every push he made. Lisa was having an orgasm as his body tightened, and he groaned at her back arch. He put his big hand on her lower back and pulled her closer as he came. Alessandro kisses her and helps her get dressed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking back hand in hand, they went to take a shower. Lisa decides to wear a simple summer dress and put her hair in a high ponytail. Alessandro came out of the bathroom dressed in jeans and a white shirt. Alessandro took her hand, and they went down for dinner and ate in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what do you want to do after dinner?&#34; Lisa asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MMM, I can think of a lot of things the two of us can do together.&#34; Alessandro winks at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa rolls her eyes and says, &#34;Get your head out of the gutter, Mr.; how about we have a movie night and relax?&#34; She suggests. Alessandro agrees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They finished their food and went to the living room. Lisa decides to choose a movie and put an action movie on for them. After the movie, Lisa looks at Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about we play twenty questions&#34;? Lisa asked. Alessandro laughs and asks her, &#34;How old are you again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, watch it&#34;, Lisa laughs. &#34;Alright, I will start with your favorite color,&#34; Alessandro asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Black, and yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, favorite song?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Savage love, Jason Derulo, and yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thinking out loud after last night,&#34; He replies with a wink. Lisa thinks about last night and smiles. Alessandro pulls her to him and kisses her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are not done yet, Mr.&#34; Lisa scolds, trying to break free, but Alessandro just holds her tight. He starts to nibble her earlobe and whisper, &#34;Are you sure we are not done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa gives up and turns to Alessandro, lowering her lips to his. The kiss gets hot and steamy. Alessandro picks her up in one move, and Lisa throws her legs around his waist. On their way to the room, Alessandro kisses and sucks her neck, earning a moan from Lisa. As he reaches the door, Lisa opens it, and Alessandro goes in, kicking it shut. He laid her down on the bed and started taking off her clothes. That night, they made passionate love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next few days go by quickly. Lisa and Alessandro enjoy every minute together. They got to know each other better. She comes to know his worst fear and what he loves the most. He might be seen as a heartless man, but deep inside he has a soft heart. She realized how much she fell for him every single day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro still can&#39;t put his feelings in perspective. He knows she makes him smile, and she knows how to have fun. Even though life gave her a few hard kicks, she still managed to stand up and take life full on. He admires her for taking her sister under her wing after their parent&#39;s deaths. She is a strong woman, and of that he is sure. Every time she comes near him, his heart skips a beat and his hands get all sweaty. But still, that can&#39;t be love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the last day of their honeymoon, it rains heavily. Alessandro and Lisa decided to stay inside and watch movies. Then Lisa decides to have some fun. She tacked Alessandro and said, &#34;Tack it&#34;, and started to run. Alessandro chased her and soon caught her inside the laundry room. He walks up to her slowly, like she is his prey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What am I going to do with you?&#34; He pretends to think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umm, you can move so that I can go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shakes his head and grabs her. He then lifts her up, and she sits on the washing machine. &#34;MMM, I like this position you are in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He starts kissing her neck and takes her shirt off next to follow her bra. He takes one breast in his mouth and starts sucking on it. Lisa throws her head back, and a moan escapes her lips. He then takes her pants and underwear off, and he starts to play with her clit. &#34;Alessandro,&#34; Lisa moans as she digs her nails into his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right there, O my God,&#34; Lisa screams as Alessandro licks her clit and inserts a finger, increasing his pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Alessandro, fuck me,&#34; Lisa begs him. Alessandro got up and dropped his pants. He then lined up his manhood at her entrance and slammed into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O fuck, baby, you feel so good,&#34; Alessandro tells her as he slams in and out of her. Lisa&#39;s body shakes violently as she undoes around him, and soon Alessandro empties himself deep inside of Lisa. They panted as they stood head-to-head, looking at each other. Alessandro opened the door, and they went out. Lisa went to take a shower and asked Alessandro if he wanted to join her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, they went and sat on the deck, watching the ocean. &#34;I could stay here forever,&#34; Lisa says as she stares at the ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can always come back; this is my Villa after all,&#34; Alessandro tells her. Lisa looks up at Alessandro and smiles at him before saying, &#34;Thank you for bringing me here; I enjoyed it.&#34;</p>
