                <p>The next morning, Lisa woke up feeling someone&#39;s hand around her. She carefully moves, looks over her shoulder, and sees Alessandro sleeping next to her. Lisa closed her eyes and recalled everything that happened the day before. She holds on to her stomach and remembers the doctor telling her that she lost the baby. She hastily grabs Alessandro and shakes him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wake up; you need to get me to the hospital, please&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro opened his eyes and asked, &#34;What happened? Are you okay?&#34;. He asks Lisa, now fully awake, and moves closer to her to look for any signs of injuries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, the doctor told me last night that I lost the baby. I want to get checked by my doctor to know for sure. Please, take me.&#34; Lisa begs him, then gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom. Alessandro doesn&#39;t have a clue what&#39;s going on but decides to get up to take Lisa to the hospital. Lisa takes a shower and realizes she doesn&#39;t have any clothes whatsoever. She wrapped the towel around her body and went back to the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are some clean clothes for you; I will be quick, then we can go to the hospital,&#34; Alessandro informs her. Lisa just nods and walks past him to the clothes. She turned around and found him still staring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; She asks him when she notices him staring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I It&#39;s nothing.&#34; Alessandro replied, embarrassed that he had gotten caught checking her body out. Lisa turns around and starts to get dressed, and Alessandro takes it as his cue to get ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa waits for Alessandro to finish and decides to check on Lilani. She walks out of the room and notices Jake and Kevin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey everyone, how is Johnny?&#34; Lisa asks, sounding concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s going to be alright, he&#39;s still sleeping, and the doctor says he will wake up soon,&#34; Kevin tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad to hear that he&#39;s doing alright; I will forever be grateful for what he did.&#34; Lisa says this with tears in her eyes. Things could have turned out badly now that she thinks about it. If it weren&#39;t for Johnny, Alessandro could have been dead. Kevin noticed Lisa&#39;s tears and went up to her and hugged her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, he&#39;s a strong man. Don&#39;t cry; he wouldn&#39;t want you to feel guilty.&#34; Kevin says it, and Lisa nods. She knows Johnny wouldn&#39;t want her to be sad, but she still feels guilty about what happened to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry to hear about the baby. Shouldn&#39;t you be in bed resting?&#34; Jake whispers it gently. He knows this is going to tear her apart, knowing she lost the baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I need to go to the hospital. I asked Alessandro to take me. I&#39;m just waiting for him. Do you know where Lilani is?&#34; She asks them knowing her sister must be worried sick about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we were just there. She&#39;s still sleeping peacefully. Maybe you can check up on her when you get back from the hospital.&#34; Jake suggests. Lisa nods and is just about to say something when Alessandro makes his appearance. &#34;Hey everyone, have there been any updates?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro is standing right behind Lisa. She can feel her body go stiff as soon as she hears his voice. She doesn&#39;t know how to face him. She feels hurt, disappointed and most of all like a failure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, the doctor says he will be alright, but he is still fast asleep.&#34; Kevin informs Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s great news. I will visit him once we are back.&#34; Kevin and Jake nod, then go inside Johnny&#39;s room as they can feel the tension between Lisa and Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ready when you are.&#34; Lisa turns to face Alessandro. She missed him so much, but she just can&#39;t forget what he has done to her. She heard what he said last night. She wants to believe him, but she finds it difficult. Lisa walked past him and went down the stairs. Alessandro sighs and then follows her. They went to the car, and Alessandro started driving towards the hospital. Once they arrived at the hospital, Lisa went inside with Alessandro following her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Mancini, please follow me, Dr. Johnson is waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa looked confused; she didn&#39;t call her doctor. &#34;I called Dr. Johnson and told her what happened,&#34; Alessandro explains. Lisa looks up at him shocked. She can&#39;t believe she didn&#39;t hear him talk on the phone. Lisa and Alessandro follow the nurse to the room where the doctor is waiting for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning Mr. and Mrs. Mancini. Will you please lay down on the bed for me?&#34; The doctor warmly welcomes them. Lisa and Alessandro greet the doctor and then Lisa go and lay down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, let&#39;s see.&#34; The doctor puts the gel on Lisa&#39;s stomach and starts with the check-up. Suddenly Lisa hears the heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see here? That is one; now let&#39;s check and see if we can find the others.&#34; The doctor informs them. Soon they hear another heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks like all three babies are going to be alright.&#34; Alessandro looks at the doctor then at Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you just say three?&#34; He asks, not sure if he heard correctly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mrs. Mancini found out the last time she was here. I suggest you rest as much as you can and avoid stress. You were under a lot of stress, and it&#39;s not good for you or the babies. The chance that you can lose one or all of them is great. So I need you to stop stressing and rest otherwise I&#39;m going to put you on bed rest for the rest of the pregnancy.&#34; The doctor tells Lisa. Lisa looked at the doctor, she couldn&#39;t believe that she could lose her babies if she didn&#39;t take care of herself. Lisa wipes the gel off and pulls her shirt down. Alessandro helps her up, and then they thank the doctor and go out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need anything from the store?&#34; Alessandro asks Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I think I just want to go home and lay down for a bit.&#34; Lisa replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I will take you home. Can we talk as soon as possible?&#34; Alessandro asks her. He needs to explain things to her, and he really wants to make her understand that everything he did, he did it to protect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we need to talk about everything that had happened, maybe we can stop at the park where I first met your grandparents?&#34; Lisa suggests. Alessandro nods then drives towards the park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the park, Alessandro gets out and walks to Lisa&#39;s side, and opens the door for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; They walk silently to an open bench.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, what do you want to talk about?&#34; Lisa asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First I want to explain why I did what I did to you. I received photos of you where you were, what you did. They threatened that if I didn&#39;t leave you that I would receive body parts of you. I tried to protect you, but instead, I got you kidnapped.&#34; Alessandro explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know why you did it, but I still feel hurt that you didn&#39;t trust me enough to talk about it. I thought we were going, to be honest with each other, but you decided to keep secrets from me, and you started seeing Bianca again. Do you realize how that made me feel? I love you, Alessandro, I do, but I need time to think about everything. You have hurt me more than anyone has ever hurt me. You were and still are my first love. Can I ask you something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you... you know... sleep with Bianca?&#34; Lisa asks regretting the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I didn&#39;t sleep with her, I promise, I did kiss her to make it look real.&#34; Alessandro replies ashamed now that he says it out loud. Lisa looks at Alessandro trying to fight the tears that threaten to come out. Alessandro noticed the tears and knew it was his fault for making her cry. He wishes he could turn back time, but sadly he can&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cleared her throat and said &#34;Can you please take me home now? I feel tired.&#34; Alessandro nods and stands up. He knows he just messed things up, but he needed to tell her the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the mansion, Lisa went up to her room and started crying. She knows why he did it, but it still hurts thinking that he kissed Bianca. She cries herself to sleep thinking about Alessandro and Bianca together.</p>
