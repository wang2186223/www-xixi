                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro and I have been married for four months now. Lilani is doing great, and it seems the chemo is working. Alessandro came to me the day after his friends were here and told me that we could only be friends. He told me that he didn&#39;t want to give me hope because he would never love me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although it felt like someone had stuck a knife in my heart, I decided that it was best if I kept my feelings aside. Lilani has been going to school not far from the mansion; she enjoys school and has made some friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice is still part of the household; she became part of the family for everyone and was loved by everyone. Sophia and Gabriele are now almost six months pregnant with a little girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriele is already overprotective, and Sophia isn&#39;t allowed to do anything. Johnny, Jake, and Kevin also come over regularly, or Alessandro and I go to one of their houses. The guys and I became like brothers and sisters to each other; they grew very fond of me and promised to protect me. Lilani feels like a princess every time they get her from school, saying they are her bodyguards. My Italian has improved since I started my lessons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As usual, I went with him to his office to help him with paperwork and read memos to him. He says he wants to hear how my Italian is going. I was busy reading one memo when a woman came into the office where we sit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, my dear Alessandro!&#34; A very hoarse voice comes from the door. She steps closer and kisses Alessandro full on the mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have missed you, baby&#34;, she says, and then turns and looks sharply at me before saying,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please get me a chair and put it next to Mr. Mancini, then you can go. I will watch over your patient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait a minute,&#34; Alessandro says with a cold voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa isn&#39;t just my nurse, Bianca. Allow me to introduce you to my remarkable wife, Lisa Mancini,&#34; he asserts, firmly gripping my hand. His voice turns icy as he continues, &#34;This woman beside me is my former fiancé, Bianca Lombardi.&#34; When she heard I was blind, she left me for someone else and then got engaged to him. I would love to know why she is here in my office&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already told you I have missed you very much, Alessandro,&#34; Bianca says sweetly while pulling a chair closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I left Lucas a few months ago&#34;. Bianca says. When Alessandro doesn&#39;t reply, she frowns and continues, &#34;I didn&#39;t know you got married, baby; your wife looks like a schoolgirl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it&#39;s because she is small and tiny&#34;, Alessandro says with a cold voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa will turn twenty-five years old in a few months, so she can&#39;t be a child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s true,&#34; the blond girl says with distaste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not a child, but she is still young for you; you are thirty- two-years-old after all, baby&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, would you like to see me with an old woman?&#34; Alessandro says. I smile amusedly behind my hand, pretending not to hear anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s face flushes with a mix of annoyance and embarrassment, yet she maintains her composure as she delicately inquires, &#34;Darling, if you don&#39;t mind me asking, how long have you been married?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing mysterious about our marriage, Bianca. We were married very quietly here in the garden of my mansion four months ago because my sister-in-law was very ill at the time,&#34; Alessandro says calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, then you&#39;ve been married for four months,&#34; Bianca says with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I must say it did not take you long to forget me, or did you perhaps marry in the hope that you would be able to forget me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro laughs briefly and bitterly and then says with a sarcastic tone, &#34;What makes you think that I&#39;ve missed you, Bianca? Or did you think that I would be sulking because the woman I once loved left me? I was never one to sulk, Bianca &#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca looks at Alessandro sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I have to say you could have waited a few months longer with this marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see no reason why Lisa and I should postpone our marriage, Bianca,&#34; Alessandro says, getting angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are happy, and I want nothing more from life except to have the use of my eyes again and maybe some children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put the Memo back on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro, honey, I&#39;m just going to the bathroom, then we can go and have some lunch,&#34; I tell him, smiling at Bianca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alright, baby, I will wait for you to come back,&#34; Alessandro tells me, kissing my hand. I quickly left the office, realizing that I would lose my temper and tell the girl exactly what I thought of her. When she had Alessandro, she didn&#39;t want him because he was blind and his grandfather took care of most of the business, but now that he&#39;s married, he&#39;s suddenly good enough, and she wants him back. I can&#39;t understand why Alessandro doesn&#39;t send her away; of course, he still loves her, which is why he allows her to stay. I don&#39;t know what he sees in her, because she looks like a real-life Barbie doll with all that make-up and the short dress she&#39;s wearing. She looks like she&#39;s going to a strip club. I suddenly realized that I feel jealous that Bianca is the one to whom Alessandro&#39;s heart belongs. I quickly went inside the bathroom and washed my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deciding to go back, I spot Leonardo. &#34;Leonardo, will you please ask to make an extra place ready at our usual place?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, Mrs. Mancini, but if I may ask why?&#34; Leonardo asks me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I assume that Mr. Mancini&#39;s ex-fiancé will come along,&#34; I inform him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, is she still in there?&#34; He is surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I don&#39;t think she&#39;s going to leave soon.&#34; I smiled sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope she realizes that it will be shameless to stay for lunch, Mrs. Mancini,&#34; Leonardo says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think Bianca knows what that word means, Leonardo,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I summarized her upright, and I think I did, she&#39;s going to do everything in her power to win Alessandro back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonardo looks at me. &#34;I don&#39;t think she&#39;s going to succeed, Mrs. Mancini,&#34; Leonardo assures me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Mancini won&#39;t let her make a fool of him twice, and I think he&#39;s falling for you.&#34; Leonardo continues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I think you&#39;re mistaken, Leonardo, and if he does decide to get back together with her, I will let him go,&#34; I say with a sad smile and walk back to the office. I opened the door and wasn&#39;t surprised when I saw that Bianca was still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro, honey, it&#39;s time for lunch,&#34; I say as sweetly as I can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca quickly stands up and says, &#34;I will take him out to lunch&#34;. I hear the bitch say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca is joining us for lunch; Lisa, can you ask Leonardo to phone them for an extra seat?&#34;, Alessandro informs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already asked him, my love,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro takes my hand and says, &#34;I prefer that my wife take me to the restaurant and not you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; So now, after everything...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not part of our family, Bianca. You&#39;re not my wife,&#34; he tells her with a hint of anger. &#34;Moreover, what kind of impression will people have if I&#39;m seen with another woman who isn&#39;t my wife? We will meet you at the place.&#34; He says this to her again. I look up at Bianca and notice her face going red with anger. Her lips were pressed together. I can see she has not succeeded in making Alessandro fall for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took Alessandro&#39;s arm and felt his big hand search for mine, find it, and gently slide his fingers through mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least you have tiny hands, my little one&#34;, I hear him say with a friendly smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s a shame,&#34; I smile back, &#34;That not everyone is blessed with a long, slender body.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to envy tall, slender girls at all, my love,&#34; I hear Alessandro say lovingly again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I prefer petite women that I can protect.&#34; I notice how Bianca watches me from the corner of my eye. She doesn&#39;t hide her anger and envy, because her face reveals every emotion. We walk to the elevator and step inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca, you can catch the other elevator that everyone else uses. This is my one.&#34; Alessandro tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!&#34; Bianca shouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want dinner with us or not?&#34; Alessandro asks, getting irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, babe, I will see you at the restaurant.&#34; She quickly says this before running out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I realize I made a mistake when I broke off our engagement at the time. Now he is married, and it is going to be a battle to put an end to his marriage. I refuse to believe that he forgot me and that someone else has already taken my place in his heart. I will not rest until I win Alessandro and his billions for myself again. The fact that he is blind no longer matters as long as his grandparents don&#39;t have anything to do with his business. That&#39;s all that matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I want him back, and I will do anything in my power to get him back. Just wait and see, Alessandro. As long as he doesn&#39;t find out that Lucas is gone, he left all his money to him. Yes, I cheated on Alessandro with his cousin after finding out he would take over the family business, but a few months ago I came to realize that their grandparents run the show and that Lucas only takes care of his own small business. I was so mad that I phoned my father to get rid of the lying bastard, and that&#39;s when I heard that Alessandro was still CEO of the company. I finally reached the place, stopping right behind them. Getting out of the car, I noticed his grandparents and a little girl. Great, do they have to be here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa, my dear. How are you doing?&#34; Grandma asks as soon as I get out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Grandma, I&#39;m doing well; thank you for asking.&#34; I smiled at her. Alessandro takes my hand and greets his grandparents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s she doing here?&#34; Grandma asks when Bianca steps out of her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma! She will be joining us for lunch.&#34; Alessandro tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want her here!&#34; Grandma continues to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told her to come, so just bear with it, alright?&#34; Alessandro rudely tells his grandma, but before she can say anything, Bianca appears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, grandma! I have missed you.&#34; She says she wants to hug Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t miss you, and please don&#39;t call me grandma; it&#39;s Mrs. Mancini to you&#34;. Grandma says to her. Bianca looks at Grandma, then at Alessandro, hoping he will defend her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go inside,&#34; Alessandro says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will take him,&#34; Bianca says, stepping forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, his wife will take him inside.&#34; Grandma stops her. I hide my smile and take Alessandro&#39;s hand, leading him inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a reservation under Mancini,&#34; Grandpa tells the waitress.</p>
