                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was right; it wasn&#39;t even ten on a Friday morning when Bianca&#39;s car stopped in front of the mansion. I was busy making us coffee when Alessandro asked. &#34;Whose car door did I just hear, Lisa?&#34; Alessandro wants to know with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s your lover, Alessandro&#34;. I can&#39;t keep the anger out of my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you expect?&#34; Alessandro wants to know with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That she will visit you every day...&#34; Bianca&#39;s appearance shut me up, but I felt how anger burned inside me when the blond went up to Alessandro and kissed him. Then she pulls a chair next to Alessandro and starts chatting with him as if I weren&#39;t here. I watched Alessandro&#39;s handsome face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I can read his feelings for Bianca. Then I realized, with a shock, that I loved him. How and when it happened, I&#39;m not sure; I just know that I love this man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel how every drop of blood leaves my face when I realize that my love for him is doomed because Bianca, the only one he loves, has returned to win him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn my head away and look at the flowers. When lunch is ready, I feel relieved. After lunch, I can take Lilani to the chemo and be alone with my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s a hot, sunny day. I went inside with Lilani to make sure she was alright, then I went outside to get some water from the cafeteria. I&#39;m so deep in thought, that I don&#39;t hear footsteps behind me. I got startled when a voice suddenly said behind me, &#34;Is this seat taken?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stand up and look at the man before saying with a cold voice, &#34;I don&#39;t know you; please leave me alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me introduce myself. I am Mr. Lombardi, Bianca&#39;s father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care who you are, Mr. Lombardi,&#34; I interrupt. &#34;Leave me alone&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you are so beautiful, Mrs. Mancini. How can anyone leave you alone?&#34; The man laughs as if he just heard a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I should just take you and give you to my nephew, then Bianca can have Alessandro back. Besides, he loves Bianca, and with you there in the way, he will never take Bianca back&#34;. I walk past him in Piero&#39;s direction, just as someone tries to grab me. Piero comes to my rescue. He tells me to go inside the hospital and stay there. I run towards the hospital with Piero watching me until I&#39;m inside. A sight of relief escapes Piero when he sees me, and after Lilani is done, the three of us go back to the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alice takes Lilani to her room to rest while I go to tell Alessandro that I have returned. When I enter the room, Piero is already there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who tried to take you, Lisa? Piero just told me what happened, and he saw you talking to an older man in the cafeteria&#34;. Alessandro asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca keeps quiet and looks pale. &#34;It was Bianca&#39;s father. He told me he would take me to his nephew because Bianca and you will never get back together as long as I am here,&#34; I told him with anger clear in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know how he knew that I would be at the hospital. He walked straight up to me, even though I had never seen him in my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s face is red with anger, but she manages to say. &#34;I don&#39;t think it was that bad, Lisa....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe not to you, Bianca&#34; I interrupted, angry, &#34;But his behavior was scary, and I felt threatened&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will talk to my father and bring him here tomorrow morning to apologize.&#34; Bianca tries to talk the whole situation away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, but that won&#39;t be necessary; I don&#39;t wish to see or talk to him&#34;, I say very angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca stands up and apologizes, saying, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but I have to go now.&#34; And leave quickly. That&#39;s strange, I thought. I notice Alessandro&#39;s silence, &#34;Excuse me, I don&#39;t want to interfere with your affairs, Alessandro, but if you want a divorce, to marry Bianca ... I mean, it&#39;s clear that she wants you back, and Lilani and I can go back to South Africa tomorrow. Our passports are still valid!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would be better if you didn&#39;t say anything more, Lisa.&#34; He says with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not need anyone&#39;s advice! And never talk about going back to South Africa again. Do not try to run away either, because I will find you wherever you run to. I know you have often regretted this marriage. But just remember, you were willing to marry me when you needed money. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need for you to remind me about everything, Alessandro&#34;. I told him ashamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just suggesting it because I know how much you love Bianca...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know anything,&#34; he interrupts her, &#34;Stop thinking because clearly you are not qualified to do so and mind your own fucking business!&#34; I just look at him. How dare this son of a bitch say this to me? I thought angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arrived home and went straight to my father. &#34;Daddy, you were so careless. Lisa told Alessandro everything!  We have to think about another plan. I informed her that you would apologize tomorrow morning. I say angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that stupid girl hadn&#39;t run out of the cafeteria, we could have caught her. I will not go to that place&#34;. My father says this in a stern voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I have to warn you, Alessandro will never leave a beauty like her for you&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t ask for your opinion, father; just get rid of her&#34;. I tell him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great, I&#39;ll get in touch with Donatello and make some plans with him. No need to worry, my princess, very soon you&#39;ll have Alessandro exclusively for yourself,&#34; Father says cunningly, grinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I better because I want him back with all of his money, and if his grandparents are going to stand in my way as well, get rid of them too,&#34; I tell my father. We are also mafia. The Lombardi&#39;s, but not as big as Gravano. My father deals with drugs, guns, and prostitution-yeah, human trafficking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Donatello arrived at my apartment. I look him up and down and say, &#34;Glad to see you made it on time. Are you ready to meet Lisa? You know what to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know what to do, Bianca; I&#39;m not a fucking child&#34;, Donatello says angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t fucking mess this up; I want her gone today!&#34; He just nods and walks towards my car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilani was busy reading for Alessandro and me when one of the maids came in and announced Bianca and another man&#39;s arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, she had brought her father with her? I just hope you don&#39;t expect me to talk to him, because I will forget that I am a woman and get nasty&#34;, I angrily tell him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about her father, Lisa; I will keep him company,&#34; Alessandro assures me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take me to the small living room, please, and remember your place is next to me. Lilani, honey, why don&#39;t you and Alice go to the park for a while?&#34; Alessandro tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, the park. Alice! Alice!&#34; Lilani shouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, my dear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ali said the two of us should go to the park&#34;. Alice looks at us, and I nod. Alice took Lilani&#39;s hand, and they went to the kitchen, probably to get a basket and food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t leave you alone with those two&#34;, I take his arm and say, &#34;You can get mad, but I don&#39;t care, I don&#39;t trust them&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t get mad&#34;, Alessandro says softly with a smile. I led him to our guests, hoping Lilani wouldn&#39;t come in. Bianca and a younger-looking man were standing when we entered the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro, honey, Daddy couldn&#39;t make it, so he sent Donatello to apologize on his behalf.&#34; Bianca immediately says this as she walks up to Alessandro and kisses him. My body stiffened at the sight of this. Alessandro noticed it and stroked my hand with his thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your father could have just phoned; there was no need for the two of you to come all the way&#34;, I say harshly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will take Alessandro to a chair; Donatello wants to talk to you&#34;, Bianca says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need for that; I don&#39;t have anything to say to him, and he can talk in front of Alessandro, I will take him myself,&#34; I say in a cold voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry if I did anything wrong&#34;, Bianca angrily says. &#34;I don&#39;t want to stand here the whole day listening to your apologies, Bianca&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro turns to me and says with love in his voice, &#34;Please take me to the couch, my love&#34;. Alessandro and Donatello begin to talk about business, pretending that nothing has happened. After something to drink, Donatello asks for a bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa can show him, you won&#39;t mind, will you, Alessandro?&#34; Bianca suggests. My whole body stiffens, and I silently wish Alessandro would say no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa, love, will you please show our guest the bathroom&#34;, Alessandro says. I stand up and walk out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On my way up, I hear Donatello say, &#34;Bianca and her father never mentioned how beautiful you are; I think I might have to keep you for myself, Lisa&#34;. I ignored his comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally arrived in the bathroom and said, &#34;Here is the bathroom; you know your way back&#34;, Just as I turned around, Donatello reaches for my arm and pulled me back, &#34;I didn&#39;t say you could leave, give those two some time alone, you know they still love each other, plus I can think of many ways to keep you busy,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Donatello tells me with a smirk. I try to pull my arm away, but he just holds it tighter. &#34;Leave me, or I will scream. Do you hear me?&#34; I threatened him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, sweetheart, I dare you to scream; if you do, you will wish you never did. Now be a good girl and show me a way out where no one can see us,&#34; Donatello says with an evil glint in his eyes. I must think fast because if I go with him, I might never see anyone again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, I will show you; just follow me&#34;, I say, scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O no, sweetheart, I&#39;m not letting you go; don&#39;t try anything funny because you will regret it&#34;. He threatens. I nod and lead us towards the stairs. As I almost reached the stairs, I stomped my foot hard on his, and he let out a yelp and let go of me. I ran for the stairs without looking back, then I felt someone from behind pushing me. I lost my balance and let out a scream as I fell down the stairs.</p>
