                <p>Lisa comes out of the bathroom and notices that Alessandro&#39;s place is empty. She decides to go down and start making breakfast. Lisa went down the stairs and smelled pancakes. Silently, she tiptoed to the kitchen and discovered Alessandro, shirtless, completely absorbed in preparing a delicious meal. She starts to drool at the sight of her sexy husband. What she will do to him right now is to touch his abs, kiss him all over, and then make sweet love to him right here in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take a picture it lasts longer.&#34; Alessandro brought her out of her dirty thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t staring at you.&#34; Lisa plays it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not what the drool from your mouth shows.&#34; Lisa wipes her mouth and finds him laughing at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t staring my ass.&#34; Alessandro laughs. Lisa throws him a dirty look, but her husband only smirks at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what are we planning for today?&#34; Lisa changes the subject before she embarrasses herself more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was thinking maybe we could go down to the beach and take some surfing lessons if you want?&#34; Lisa smiled and nodded. She always wanted to learn how to surf. Alessandro starts dishing for them and Lisa can&#39;t wait to dig in. With every bite, she takes Lisa, moans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can make you moan louder if you don&#39;t stop,&#34; Alessandro says with lust in his eyes. Lisa stops eating and gives him a toothy smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think so, Mr. Mancini?&#34; She asks him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t push me, Mrs. Mancini, because I will take you and spank you.&#34; Lisa&#39;s eyes went wide, somehow hearing him say that turns her on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These hormones are driving me crazy!&#34; She thought. &#34;I doubt that these pancakes feed me and the babies; when you have me moaning, I get pregnant.&#34; Lisa gives a sassy reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O really? I didn&#39;t hear you complain last night when you begged me to fuck you.&#34; Alessandro shot back. Lisa feels her face heat up, remembering last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, we probably should get ready if we want to take surfing lessons,&#34; Lisa says without looking at her husband. Alessandro only smiles at his wife&#39;s shyness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, how about we shower together to save water?&#34; He wiggles his eyebrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa shakes her head, standing up, and walks towards the stairs, saying, &#34;See you in the shower.&#34; She says it over her shoulder, then starts running up. She hears a groan and then footsteps behind her. Suddenly, her feet are lifted off the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baboon, put me down!&#34; Lisa shouts. She gasps as she feels a sting on her butt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did, you just spank me?&#34; She asks shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can say that&#39;s for being a smart ass.&#34; He shrugs it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa and Alessandro walk hand in hand down to the beach. &#34;Good morning, Mr. Mancini. Are you and your wife ready to surf?&#34; A well-built, dark haired man asks Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Alex, yes we are ready, but please remember that this is my wife&#39;s first time, and she&#39;s expecting.&#34; Alex looks over to Lisa and smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to worry about a thing, she&#39;s in good hands,&#34; Alex assures him. Alex teaches Lisa the basics not in water but on the beach. Lisa feels stupid but does as she&#39;s told. Soon they went into the water. Alessandro watches as Alex learns Lisa to surf and gets jealous when he saw his hands on his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I will take it from here, thank you, Alex.&#34; Alessandro let him go. Alex nods then turns to Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good luck and congratulations to the baby.&#34; Lisa nods and thanks him, then she turns to Alessandro with her hands on her heaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that all about&#34;? She asks him. Alessandro shrugs, &#34;I didn&#39;t like the way he was touching my wife.&#34; Lisa rolls her eyes, &#34;He didn&#39;t do it on purpose, he&#39;s trying to teach me to surf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still I don&#39;t like another man touching what&#39;s mine.&#34; Lisa just shakes her head. She can&#39;t believe he&#39;s that jealous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides I can teach you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O? Do you know how to surf?&#34; Lisa questions him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup, come I will show you if you don&#39;t believe me.&#34; Lisa watches as Alessandro takes his board and swims further in. She watches as a big wave comes up and Alessandro gets ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, I never thought he could surf,&#34; Lisa says out loud. That morning Alessandro teaches Lisa to surf. After some time surfing, Lisa&#39;s stomach growls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like somebody&#39;s hungry. Let&#39;s go and feed you guys.&#34; Lisa and Alessandro walk to a restaurant not far from the beach. They enjoy lunch and then Lisa says she feels tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get you to bed. You&#39;re meant to be taking a rest.&#34; Alessandro says and then picks her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can walk you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, but I like to carry you.&#34; Come to his reply. Lisa snuggles into his chest and falls asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lisa wakes up she finds a note on her bed stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have already prepared a relaxing bath for you. On the chair is a dress I want you to wear. When you are finished, go to the kitchen.&#34; She reads the note. Lisa stood up and went to the bathroom. True to his word, she finds the tub full of candles and rose pedals. Lisa takes her clothes off and relaxes in the bath. When her hands and fingers become pruned, she gets out and takes the towel. Walking back to the bedroom she takes a look at the dress and decides on what lingerie to wear. Then she does her makeup, and lastly, she gets dressed. The dress is a strapless white dress that reaches her knees. She wears her silver high heels. She walks down to the kitchen and finds another note with a rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that you are dressed, go to the backyard and follow the trail.&#34; She reads the note out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you up to Mancini?&#34; She ponders aloud. She walks to the back door and sees the rose petals and lights making a path she decided to follow the path, and then sees a sign, &#34;I was such a fool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reads then continues, &#34;I wish I never let you go. I promise to make it up to you every day for the rest of our lives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa smiled then continued, &#34;I have so many reasons why I love you. You have such a kind heart.&#34; Lisa now wonders what he&#39;s up to. Just a few steps ahead, she reads, &#34;Number 2. You always put others first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then another one. &#34;You always see the good side in every situation.&#34; Lisa continues walking and reads all the reasons why he loves her, then she reaches the end and sees a small tent in the middle of a heart shape made out of rose pedals. Lisa walks towards the tent but doesn&#39;t see Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa, there are so many reasons why I love you, and to name each one is going to take me a lifetime. I know I messed up the day I left you. I should&#39;ve trusted you, but I was afraid. You have taught me to be blind, don&#39;t define who you are. You stood by my side even when I was rude to you.&#34; Lisa hears Alessandro say and looks around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You never gave up on me, that night on our honeymoon you gave me your most precious gift that night and when we came back I treated you poorly. I want you to know that that night was the best night of my entire life. I have done so many wrongs that I will need a lifetime to show you how much I regret everything I have done to you.&#34; Lisa searched for him, then she saw him walking toward her with a huge bouquet of red roses and people started bringing more roses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can only hope that you will give me a chance to show you how much I love you, how much I regret everything. Between all of these roses is a fake one. I will love you till the last one dies.&#34; Lisa watches as they bring thousands of roses to her. Alessandro walks up to her where she&#39;s surrounded by roses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa,&#34; Alessandro said, then goes down on one knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you please marry me again?&#34; Lisa looks down at Alessandro with tears in her eyes. She loves him. He&#39;s showing how much he regrets what he has done. But will she be able to trust him again?</p>
