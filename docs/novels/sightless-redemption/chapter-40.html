                <p>WARNING!! SEXUAL SCENE!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandpa is back at the farm, and it seems like he&#39;s getting better with each passing day. Alessandro and Grandpa Johan seem to be getting along very well. Alessandro and the old man talk about Alessandro&#39;s business, and the old man tells him about his farming. Alessandro enjoys this visit, as does Grandpa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two weeks have passed since they arrived in South Africa. Each day, Alessandro sees a new sight of Lisa. One night, he asks Lisa if he can talk to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... um... I was thinking... if you are willing, then maybe we could give our marriage a real chance?&#34; Nervously, he asks her. Lisa smiles brightly and jumps into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I would give it a try.&#34; Alessandro looked into her eyes and then bent down, capturing her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just made me the happiest man alive.&#34; He says this and spins her around in his arms. Lisa has never felt this happy in her whole life. Finally, she gets to belong to someone. They went for a walk outside, and Lisa looked up at the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish my parents were here to meet you,&#34; she tells him. Alessandro holds her close and says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Both of our parents are watching us from above, and I think your parents would have been proud of the woman you are today.&#34; Lisa looks at him, stands on her toes, and kisses Alessandro tenderly. Suddenly they feel water drops, and both look up when it starts to rain. Alessandro grabs Lisa&#39;s hand, and they run towards the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They quietly walked to their room to get dry clothes, and then went to take a shower. Lisa washes Alessandro&#39;s back and then hands him the sponge. Alessandro starts washing her back, then whispers in her ears, &#34;If your family wasn&#39;t here, I would have taken you right here.&#34; Lisa turns to him and says, &#34;So, they can&#39;t see us&#34;, biting her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s all Alessandro wanted to hear when he smashed his lips on hers; the kiss was urgent and demanding. Alessandro cups Lisa&#39;s bud, and she throws her legs around him. Alessandro thrust inside her, picking up his pace in and out. Lisa muffles her screams and digs her nails into his back as both of them come undone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, baby, we must finish before someone finds us,&#34; Alessandro tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They wash again, then climb out and get dressed. Lisa went to the kitchen to make them some hot chocolate. Just as Alessandro comes in, lightning strikes, and Lisa runs into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know you were afraid of lightning&#34;, he teases her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s more afraid of lightning than she ever was of hiding&#34;. Her aunt speaks as she comes into the kitchen. Alessandro laughs, and Lisa hits his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think this is a few days&#39; rain,&#34; Amalia tells them as she looks out of the window. Eugene also joins them: &#34;Grandpa is fast asleep; he seems to have taken a liking to you, Alessandro.&#34; Eugene says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh, yes, we all have. You are a very well-mannered young man, and I think my sister-in-law and brother would have been proud to call you their son-in-law. Lisa, honey, he&#39;s a keeper.&#34; Amalia is winking at Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Aunt Amalia. I appreciate it. But it&#39;s me who is the lucky one; she&#39;s a strong woman, kind, caring, and has a good personality.&#34; Alessandro tells them while looking at Lisa. Lisa&#39;s aunt and uncle say goodnight and leave the two lovebirds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They soon went to bed themselves. Lisa fell asleep in his arms, and sleep soon overtook him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were busy having breakfast when Alessandro&#39;s phone rang. &#34;Excuse me&#34;, he says, then goes out to answer. After a few minutes, he returns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything alright?&#34; Lisa was concerned when she saw the look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am afraid not; it was my assistant; there seems to be a problem at work that urgently needs my attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I will start packing, and then we can leave as soon as we are finished,&#34; Lisa informs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandpa is sad when he hears they have to leave so soon. &#34;I understand, son; please come and visit soon and take care of my two grandkids&#34;, he says sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise I will take good care of them, and you can always come and visit us in Italy,&#34; Alessandro tells grandpa. &#34;That sounds like a great plan. I will let you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good bey, grandpa. Take care of yourself. I love you.&#34; Lisa tells him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they greet everyone, Lisa&#39;s uncle takes them to the airport. &#34;Thank you, uncle; let me know how it goes with Grandpa. Thank you for everything.&#34; Lisa hugs her uncle, then takes Lilani&#39;s hand and waits for Alessandro. Alessandro and Eugene greet each other, and then Eugene drives away. The three of them went inside the plane and took their seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa looks up and notices Alessandro typing on his laptop. She then decides to draw with Lilani and help her with her Italian lessons. After a few hours, Alessandro asks the hostess to bring lunch for them: &#34;Is there anything I can do to help?&#34; Lisa asks him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you and Lilani can take some rest if you want to; I will wake you up when we land.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After eating his lunch, Alessandro started typing again, and Lisa and Lilani went on with the Italian lessons. Soon Lilani fell asleep, and Lisa carried her to the bedroom and laid down for a bit herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa wakes Lilani when they are about to land, takes her to her seat, and then fastens her belt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they stepped out, Lisa noticed Antonio, Piero, and Leonardo. &#34;Hey, guys.&#34; She greets them and gives each a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome back, Mrs. Mancini&#34;. Lisa looks at them and shakes her head. When are they going to learn to call her Lisa? She feels like an old woman every time they call her Mrs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Piero will drop you off at home as soon as he drops me off at the office,&#34; Alessandro informs Lisa. Lisa nods and stares out of the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t eaten anything yet, Antonio; please make sure he eats dinner tonight&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mrs. Mancini,&#34; he replies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro kisses Lisa as soon as they stop at his office, then they get out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Piero arrives at the mansion and helps Lisa take their bags inside. Alice walks up to them and helps Lisa with a sleeping Lilani.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She must take a bath, then come to eat, please, Alice; it was a long flight,&#34; Lisa informs the older woman. Then she went to the kitchen to prepare food for them. Lilani comes down with Alice and takes a seat. Lisa gives her plate to Alice and tells her she can get some of the food for herself if she wants to eat. Alice declines and says she&#39;s going to bed. Lisa nods and wishes her a good night. After they are done eating, Lisa takes Lilani to her bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night, Lil. Sweet dreams, and remember, I love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too, Lisa&#34;. A tired Lilani says to her sister: Lisa kissed her head and then went to take a shower herself. After she showers, Lisa decides to watch some movies. After two movies, she looks at the time and notices it&#39;s past midnight. She turned the TV off and went to sleep, thinking about her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to know who hacked into my company and stole a million euros from me!&#34; Alessandro shouts at his accountant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I don&#39;t have a report on my desk by tomorrow, you are all fired. Now get out of my fucking sight&#34;!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everybody scrambled out of the door, afraid of what would happen if they stayed any longer. Alessandro and his team worked the whole night to sort the mess out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did anyone find a loophole?&#34; He asks his team. No one dares to look up. Until a young man stands up and asks to talk to Alessandro in private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I know who took the money&#34;. The young man begins to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There was this guy who worked here a long time, and I overheard him talking to someone over the phone, saying he will have the money soon; he&#39;s just waiting for the right time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When was this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About a week ago, Mr. Mancini, I didn&#39;t think much of it, but when I came in this morning and heard what&#39;s going on, I came to you directly.&#34; Alessandro nods to Antonio to get the security cameras.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Niccolino Marino, Mr. Mancini&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Niccolino; what are you doing here in the company?&#34; Alessandro asks the young man</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am the post boy, Mr. Mancini&#34;. Alessandro nods and says</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for coming forward. I will deal with this further, and I will let you know as soon as We catch the guy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the young man stands up and walks out. Antonio comes in with the CCTV footage. They start playing the tape, and after some time, they catch the culprit on the camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get that son of a bitch in my office now&#34;. Alessandro&#39;s angry voice boomed through the office.</p>
