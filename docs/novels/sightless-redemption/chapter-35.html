                <p>&#34;How do you know the dress shows my ass?&#34; She asks. Alessandro smiles down at her and sees her frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t frown like that, Cara Mia,&#34; he tells her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ho, how do you know I was frowning?&#34; She asks again. Alessandro pulls her close to him, then whispers in her ears, &#34;Because I can see you clearly.&#34; Lisa looks up at him, shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W... what, how, when?&#34; She stutters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The past few weeks that I went to Miami, I went for an operation. I got my eyesight back. I wanted you to be the first to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa looks at him with tears in her eyes, then throws her arms around his neck, saying, &#34;O, Alessandro, I am so happy for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Cara Mia; I waited long for this day. Of course, I still need to wear the sunglasses for a few weeks.&#34; He tells her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So yesterday and this whole day, you just acted like you were still blind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I planned to tell you specifically.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, thank you, Alessandro,&#34; Lisa says as she plants a full kiss on his mouth. Realizing what she has done, she looks down. Alessandro lifts her chin, then bends down and kisses her passionately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s eat before the food gets cold,&#34; Alessandro tells her. They ate, chatted for a while, and danced one last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro then takes her hand and leads her back to the Villa. Once they reached their bedroom, Alessandro opened the door and let Lisa go in first. Just as she passed him, he pulled her back and shoved her against the closed door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips connect with Lisa&#39;s, and she runs her hands through his hair. He grabs both sides of her thigh, picking her up and throwing her on the bed. He meets her over her body. Not wasting any time, his soft, dark hair brushes her jawline as he kisses her neck, sucking harshly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro.&#34; Lisa moans, gripping the bedsheet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, baby?&#34; He whispers huskily. Her hands find the bottom of his white shirt and pull it up as his fingers gently trace their way under her dress to her bra, teasing. She gasps as his thumb flicks over her nipple, and he smirks, driving her wild. His full lips take total control of her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa&#39;s never been touched like this before. He rips her dress open and takes off her lace bra, exposing her breasts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O fuck&#34;. He says it under his breath, and Lisa bites her lips, blushing. &#34;You&#39;re so fucking cute when you blush, Lisa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words drive Lisa wild in the best way possible. His voice and filthy words are something she can hardly handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands lowered down to her belly button, then lowered and lowered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa gasped and closed her eyes as his fingertips rubbed her clit softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O my God,&#34; she sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so wet for me,&#34; he says, and without permission, his finger slides inside her. His hands are so large.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro.&#34; Lisa said, her eyebrows knit together and her voice full of lust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, you&#39;re making me hard.&#34; He breathes. He started going down and sliding his tongue inside her. Lisa arched her back as his tongue licked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro&#34;, Lisa moans as she grabs his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You taste good, baby, fuck,&#34; he says as he sits up and starts playing with her clit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro!&#34; she moans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right, baby, come for me,&#34; he tells her. Lisa feels her stomach tighten and her legs begin to shake. &#34;Oh God, Alessandro!&#34; she screams in ecstasy. Alessandro licks her clean, then starts to take off his pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Alessandro,&#34; Lisa pleads, her voice filled with desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; He asks. Lisa nods and pulls him to her, kissing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He takes her underwear off and spreads her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be gentle; it&#39;s going to hurt at first. Just tell me when I must stop,&#34; he tells her. Lisa nods, and she feels how he starts pushing into her slowly and gently. As he goes deeper tears roll off her cheeks. Alessandro gently wipes it away, then tenderly kisses her. Once he&#39;s inside, he lies still for Lisa to adjust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; he asks. &#34;Yes,&#34; she whispers softly as her hips sway instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro starts pounding in and out of her. &#34;O fuck, baby, you feel so good,&#34; he says as he begins to pick up his pace. &#34;Alessandro.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right, baby, scream my name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O fuck Alessandro!&#34; Lisa screams as her stomach begins to tighten again. Her legs shake violently as an orgasm overtakes her. Alessandro finds his release soon after and falls onto Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are beautiful, Lisa,&#34; he said, kissing her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am going to run a hot bath for you with some salt; it will help with the pain you&#39;re having.&#34; He stood up and went to the bathroom. A few minutes later, he returns and then bends down and picks Lisa up, carrying her to the bathtub. He carefully puts her in and then starts washing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can get in with me,&#34; she offers. She moves up, and Alessandro slides in at her back. She let her head fall back onto his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, they wash each other off and get out. Alessandro walks out of the bathroom with just his towel. Lisa enters the room and finds Alessandro changing the sheets. She looks at the red stain and blushes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, don&#39;t blush, baby; it was the best night of my life,&#34; he tells her with a smirk. Lisa smiles at him and quickly helps him change the sheets. Soon they got into bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Alessandro and Lisa made love until the morning hours.</p>
