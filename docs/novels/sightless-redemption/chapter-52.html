                <p>Alessandro decides to check up on Johnny. He just hopes that Lisa will find it in her heart to forgive him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to Lisa? Did I hear her crying?&#34; Kevin asked Alessandro as soon as he went into Johnny&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s something that I did,&#34; Alessandro says with a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do, and how did it go at the hospital?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, the good news is we didn&#39;t lose the babies, and the bad news is Lisa needs to rest and stop stressing, otherwise she will lose them. As for what I did, Lisa asked if I slept with Bianca.&#34; Before he could finish his sentence, Jake interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you really sleep with her? It&#39;s no surprise that Lisa is in tears!&#34; Jake shouts. How could Alessandro be this stupid?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t sleep with her; I only kissed her.&#34; Alessandro defends himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still, you cheated on your wife. Goddammit, Mancini, we told you to stay away from Bianca.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I messed up big time,&#34; Alessandro says, defeated. He knows what he did was wrong, and he doesn&#39;t need his friends to tell him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, did you say something about babies?&#34; Kevin changes the subject. Alessandro nods and messes with his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it turns out we are expecting triplets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait! Triplets! As in, three of you will be here soon?&#34; Kevin says he was shocked when he heard what Alessandro said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, man, congrats. Who would&#39;ve guessed that you would be the first one to be a father? But in all seriousness, you have to set things right with Lisa.&#34; Jake says to Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m planning on setting things right, but I&#39;m going to need Sophia&#39;s and Grandma&#39;s help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, sh*t, they are going to kill us for keeping this away from them,&#34; Kevin tells them. Mrs. Mancini loves Lisa as if she were her own daughter. He knew that she was going to skin them alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, you think? After lunch, I will go to them.&#34; Alessandro says. Alessandro walks to Johnny&#39;s bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, you better wake up soon. I have some amazing news to tell you. I want to slap the shit out of you first for what you did.&#34; Alessandro jokes. The three friends stay there for a while, and then the maid calls them for lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to check up on Lisa first; you guys go ahead.&#34; Kevin and Jake nod and go downstairs. Alessandro walks to the bedroom and opens the door, finding the bed empty. He decides to go to Lilani&#39;s room; maybe she&#39;s there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa sits on Lilani&#39;s bed and reads a story to her. As she reads, the door opens and Alessandro walks in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, lunch is ready if you want to come down,&#34; Alessandro explains as to why he was there. Things feel different between them, and he can only hope that she was willing to forgive him for his mistakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you we will be down in a minute,&#34; Lisa replies without looking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ali, where have you been?&#34; Lilani asks him. Lisa looks at her sister weirdly because she doesn&#39;t want to face Alessandro let alone talk to him now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, piccolo. I was busy this morning. I will be here tonight, then I will read to you.&#34; Alessandro tells the little girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise&#34;. Alessandro says, holding out his pinky. Lilani giggles and holds her pinky out as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, let&#39;s go down for lunch.&#34; Lisa abruptly interrupts the conversation between the two of them. Lilani gets out of bed, walks up to Alessandro, takes his hand, and then starts walking out of the door. Lisa looks at the two of them. They get along very well; she just wishes things were different. She watches Alessandro as he walks down the stairs. She has missed his touch, his kisses, and mostly his presence. She wonders if she will ever be able to forgive him for what he did. She knows he was only trying to protect them, but he should&#39;ve trusted her. As she walks into the dining room, she notices Kevin and Jake already eating. Lisa just laughs at the scene in front of her. She swears these guys are still little boys who are always hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Lisa. Congratulations. We heard from Alessandro that you are expecting triplets.&#34; Kevin congratulated her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you; yeah, I still can&#39;t believe it.&#34; Lisa smiled, rubbing her small belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you&#39;re going to go mad if they are anything like their father,&#34; Jake says, chuckling. Alessandro throws him an evil eye, and then Jake and Kevin start laughing at their friend. Lisa takes a seat away from Alessandro; he notices it but keeps a straight face. He doesn&#39;t want to push her away any further than she already is. Lunch was enjoyed in a peaceful atmosphere. Kevin and Jake notice the tension on the table and decide to take Lilani.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to go to the park and grab some ice cream?&#34; Jake asks her. Lilani looks at Lisa for approval. Lisa nods then said, &#34;Yes, you can go but don&#39;t eat too many sweets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise I won&#39;t,&#34; Lilani says holding her hand on her chest. Kevin, Jake, and Lilani stand up and walk out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to Sophia&#39;s, if you need anything just call me,&#34; Alessandro informs her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will but for now I&#39;m good, thank you,&#34; Lisa answers politely. Alessandro stands up and starts walking out but then turns towards Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what it&#39;s worth, I am sorry.&#34; After uttering those words, he turns and leaves. Lisa heard the front door shut, then she went to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good to see you again, brother.&#34; Gabriele warmly greets Alessandro. &#34;How are you guys doing?&#34; Alessandro asks him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tired, the one who says babies are easy to raise don&#39;t know what they are talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That hard, huh?&#34; Alessandro laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to talk to you and Sophia if you guys don&#39;t mind.&#34; Gabriele can see something is bothering his brother and then calls for Sophia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma is here too!&#34; Gabriel informs him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great, now I&#39;m going to be killed,&#34; Alessandro whispers. As soon as Sophia and grandma join them, Alessandro tells them everything that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You fucking idiot! Where is that Bitch now? Sophia exclaims, glaring at her idiot brother-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Last night, Bianca was taken into custody.&#34; Alessandro tells her ignoring the angry look she is giving him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to kill you. You had a beautiful wife. Why would you do that to her?&#34; Grandpa asked angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you I was trying to protect them, besides the babies are doing well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, babies? Do you mean there is more than one?&#34; Gabriele asked wanting to change the subject. He knows what his brother did was stupid, but he also understands why he did it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we have an incredible surprise in store for us - we are expecting not just one, but three beautiful bundles of joy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O fuck. Hopefully, they are like their mother and not their father.&#34; Gabriele teases Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want me to do?&#34; Sophia confronts him directly. Alessandro explains what he wants to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is going to cost you, but luckily for you, I love Lisa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro and Sophia start working on the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you guys, I appreciate it,&#34; Alessandro says as he stands up and walks to his grandmother. Alessandro spent some more time with them when he tells them he will see them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know for a man who owns half of this country, your brother sure is dumb,&#34; Sophia tells Gabriele.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabriele just laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get going, Grandma. We have some planning to do,&#34; Sophia urges. Soon they were busy arranging everything. &#34;Let&#39;s just hope this is going to turn out good.&#34;</p>
