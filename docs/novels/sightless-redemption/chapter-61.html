                <p>Everyone came. Alessandro had Lisa&#39;s family come with his private jet. His family and their friends, everyone came. Sadly this is the day of Lisa&#39;s funeral. Minutes later, three limousines arrive at the mansion. Everyone steps in side the limousines. Alessandro and Sophia have triplets with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro dreads this day. He wishes Lisa was here with him and the boys. How will he raise them without her? How must he continue without her? He never thought he would love someone as much as he loves Lisa. She was his sunshine during the stormy dark days in his life. She&#39;s the reason he wakes up every morning, but now it all seems impossible without her by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The family arrived at the funeral location where the funeral would take place. The atmosphere not only looks gloomy but feels gloomy. Everywhere he looks there are no smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate this. Why did she have to die.&#34; Alessandro was tough as he went to sit in front. The flowers are white Lilies, as this was Lisa&#39;s favorite. Alessandro repositions him in the uncomfortable seats. The moment he looks up, he notices the coffin in front of him. The coffin is open so that he can see his wife one last time. But that&#39;s something he doesn&#39;t want to do. On each side of the coffin stand large white candles. Above the coffin is a photo of Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro looks down at his children. They don&#39;t even know what&#39;s happening all three are sleeping peacefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pastor begins the ceremonies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Psalm 23 says: &#34;The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name&#39;s sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My name is John Sinclair, and I am one of the pastors at St Maria. On behalf of the family, I would like to welcome you as we have gathered here together today to remember Lisa Mancini.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro tunes out he can&#39;t do this. Lisa&#39;s not dead. She can&#39;t be! She needs to wake up. Alessandro registers when he hears the pastor say. &#34;Let&#39;s pray&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father God, help us to know that no matter what you love us. Help us all walk through this difficult time in the valley of the shadow of death. Help us to be aware of your presence here with us today and every day. In the silence of this hour speak to us of eternal things, that through your love and the comfort of the Scriptures we may have hope, and be lifted above our darkness and distress into the light and peace of your presence. We ask this all in the name of your son, Jesus. Amen&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s all sing Kumbaya, my Lord.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Family and friend give their testimony. Alessandro stands up and walks to the front. He looks at the coffin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I try to take a break and relax in my busy life, my heart, it does ache,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and all I think is how I miss my wife. It hurts me so badly, all this pain inside, thinking of the love we had and the tears I have cried. I think of the places that we went to, how I love you with all my heart and all the things we didn&#39;t get to do,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but most of all how we have been torn apart. I miss you so much and love you still. I did not want to let you go, but I told myself it was God&#39;s will. Every day I see things you&#39;ve done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is lonely without you here. I try to be strong for our wonderful son&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but all I can do is drink another beer&#34;. Alessandro cries as he reads the poem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone left to the graveyard where Lisa will be laid to rest. Everyone at the service was inconsolable, quiet sobs could be heard here and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pastor stands in front of the coffin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give him, o Lord, your peace and let your eternal + light shine upon him. Amen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let us go in the peace of the Lord&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone cries as the coffin slowly goes down with Donna Taggart&#39;s Jealous of the angel&#39;s plays.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know today would be our last</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or that I&#39;d have to say goodbye to you so fast</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m so numb, I can&#39;t feel anymore</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Praying&#39; you&#39;d just walk back through that door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And tell me that I was only dreaming</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You&#39;re not gone as long as I believe</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the funeral, everyone left leaving Alessandro alone at the graveside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never loved anyone like you baby, you are my life, my morning sun and the light that brightens my night. No one can replace you. In my heart, your name is engraved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I want is you. I want to be where you are. To me, you are not dead but alive. Through every breath that I take, I can feel it, my love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see you every time I look at our son&#39;s. I still want a daughter that looks exactly like you. I&#39;m not going to let go, I&#39;m not ready to let go, and I know that this is not the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of you keeps me awake. Dreaming of you helps me sleep. And being with you keeps me alive. What do I have now? Do you miss me as I miss you? I miss you so much it&#39;s killing me, Lisa. The wound is still raw and fresh. When someone asks what I love most about life? I&#39;ll say you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I love you, always will till my last breath baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It starts pouring and Alessandro quickens his pace as the clouds begin to gather in the sky. Up until now, the sky was a beautiful blue. The blue sky was turning gravel gray. Soon he finds shelter under a big tree. It&#39;s raining intensely. It looks like the angels are crying on this sad day. Alessandro thinks back to when he first met Lisa. When she first told him she loved him. Their wedding, the birth of their beautiful sons. He looks at the graveside one last time.</p>
