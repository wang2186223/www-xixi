                <p>It&#39;s been three weeks since they went to the doctor. Alessandro is rarely at home. Lisa decided to visit Alessandro and get some food for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maria, I&#39;m going to Mr. Mancini; will you please get me a basket?&#34; Lisa asks Maria Lisa wants to surprise Alessandro with a picnic, so she decided to pack his favorite food. Soon, Lisa was ready to leave for the office. Lisa stops at Mancini Enterprise and gets the basket from the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa went in, and the girl at reception greeted her warmly. &#34;Good morning, Mrs. Mancini; how are you today? You can go straight up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great thanks you,&#34; Lisa greeted him back and then went to the elevator. She can&#39;t wait to see Alessandro; it&#39;s been three weeks since she last saw him. He comes home when she&#39;s sleeping, and sometimes not at all. The elevator door opened, and Lisa stepped out and walked to Alessandro&#39;s office. She was just about to open the door when she heard giggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could that be Bianca&#39;s voice?&#34; She thought. Once she opens the door, her heart breaks into a million pieces at the scene in front of her. She slowly closes the door and turns around, bumping into someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Mancini, are you alright?&#34; Leonardo asked when he saw tears running down her cheeks. Lisa looks up at the older man and nods, walking away. How could she be so stupid? She knew he would never love her, but she still hoped that something would change the day she gave herself to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stupid fool!&#34; Lisa shouts once she is alone in the elevator. She quickly wipes away her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t cry, Lisa; you got it.&#34; She tells herself this before the door opens again. She went outside and walked to her car. She drove off to a nearby park and went to take a seat on one of the benches, thinking about all the wonderful times she and Alessandro had. How could he do this to her? They are expecting a child together, for God&#39;s sake! She let herself cry as the memories flashed in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonardo wonders what upsets Mrs. Mancini and opens the office door. &#34;Uhm, sorry to bother you, Mr. Mancini, but your meeting starts in five minutes&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonardo interrupts the two people in front of him by sucking each other&#39;s faces. No wonder Mrs. Mancini had tears in her eyes. He can&#39;t believe that Mr. Mancini would stoop this low; he thought that Mr. and Mrs. Mancini were in love, but it looks like he misjudged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Leonardo. I will be there shortly. Please, let everyone in and give them the papers.&#34; Alessandro dismissed him. Leonardo nods, then closes the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be ready for lunch; I&#39;m taking you out&#34;. Alessandro tells Bianca once Leonardo leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we going?&#34; Bianca wants to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Somewhere special, now I have to go before this meeting starts.&#34; He kisses Bianca&#39;s cheeks. He needs to tell Lisa that he wants a divorce and that they will figure something out with the child. He just hopes everyone understands why he&#39;s doing this. With that thought, he enters the meeting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa went home and started to pack her and Lilani&#39;s suitcases. Alessandro can&#39;t keep her here and have Bianca as well. As she starts packing, Maria and Alice walk in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Mancini, what are you doing?&#34; Maria asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, Maria, Mr. Alessandro got his first love back, so I think it&#39;s time for me to leave,&#34; Lisa replied, sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about, Mrs. Mancini?&#34; Alice also asks for concern for the young girl who became like a daughter to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro and Bianca are back together. I saw them in his office when I went to surprise him; little did I know the surprise was on me&#34;, Lisa laughs bitterly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m coming with you, Miss Mancini&#34;. Alice tells her. Maria is shocked that Alessandro would do such a thing. Right now, she&#39;s so mad at her boss that he can cook dinner for himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maria and Alice help Lisa pack the bags and then take them downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be right back&#34;. Lisa tells them. Then she went upstairs to Alessandro&#39;s room. She takes her ring off and puts it on the letter she wrote to him. With tears slowly rolling down her cheeks, she takes one last look at their room and then closes the door. &#34;Mrs. Mancini, let me take you and your sister where you want to go.&#34; Antonio offers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Antonio. Alice said that we are welcome to stay at her old house if you will take us there&#34;. Lisa tells Antonio</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maria, thank you for everything you have done for me. Please take care of yourself and Mr. Mancini.&#34; Lisa tells Maria as she hugs her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, thank you, Mrs. Mancini. Thank you for sticking by Mr. Mancini&#39;s side when he was blind. Take care of yourself. I will come and visit you soon.&#34; Maria promised Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maria, from now on, you can call me Lisa.&#34; Maria smiles at Lisa, then turns to Lilani.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take care of your sister and be a good girl&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise&#34;. Lilani says to Maria: The little girl is confused; she doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but she can see that her sister is sad, wondering where Alessandro is. Then get in the car with Lisa and Alice to their new home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa looks back at the mansion and watches it disappear. Tears silently rolled down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro tells Bianca that he needs to go home tonight. As soon as he arrives home, everything is quiet. He opens the door and starts calling for Lisa and Lilani.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s strange,&#34; he thought. He went to his room, and as soon as he turned the light on, he found the room empty. Then his eyes fell on something on his side of the bed. He went and picked up Lisa&#39;s wedding ring along with the letter. He opens the letter and starts to read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dear Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time you read this letter, I will be long gone. Please don&#39;t look for me; I will get in touch with you as soon as I feel ready to face you. You must be wondering what I&#39;m talking about. You see, I went to surprise you at the office, seeing that I saw you three weeks ago. You even forgot about our second visit to the doctor. I went alone, and in your drawer, you will find the picture of our baby, but to come back to the point, when I went to surprise you, I instead got a surprise. I saw you and Bianca together sucking each other&#39;s faces, and that&#39;s when I realized why you weren&#39;t home for the past three weeks. I hope that things between you and Bianca work out this time. I knew deep down that you would never love another woman. I truly hope that you will be happy. That&#39;s why I want a divorce, because you were never really happy in this fake marriage. Thank you for everything you have done for Lilani and me; for that, I will always be grateful. Thank you for showing me what it feels like to be a woman. I will never forget the times we shared. I will be in contact with you once I feel strong enough to face you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I love you always,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro can&#39;t believe what he&#39;s reading. &#34;How dare she leave me!&#34; He shouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa, you can run, but you can&#39;t hide. I will find you wherever you are.&#34; He makes a promise. He dials Antonio and asks him if he knows about Lisa&#39;s whereabouts. Antonio tells him that he has no idea where Lisa finds herself, but when he saw her this afternoon, it looked like she&#39;d been crying. Alessandro thanks him and dials a PI&#39;s number to track Lisa down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa, soon I will find you. He thinks to himself.</p>
