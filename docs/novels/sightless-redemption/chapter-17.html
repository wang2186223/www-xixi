                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was busy helping to prepare lunch when I heard Lilani cry through the baby monitor I got from the store. I quickly ran upstairs to check on Lilani. &#34;What&#39;s the matter, Lil?&#34; I asked her, concerned. &#34;Someone was in my room, Lisa; someone kept on taping my feet; I got scared and hid under my blanket&#34;, Lilani cried. I searched the room but found nothing. Lilani didn&#39;t want to stay in her room alone, so I decided to take her to the kitchen with me. As we went down the stairs, Viola ran up the stairs and smirked at me. The next moment, Viola tumbled down the stairs screaming, and as soon as she was on the ground, she cried out in pain. &#34;What&#39;s with all this commotion?&#34; Alessandro demands in a stern voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She... she pushed me down the stairs after accusing me of scaring her sister,&#34; Viola cried out. Alessandro puts his hands out to Viola, she takes his hand and smirked at me. Alessandro holds her, and he pushes her away and says angrily, &#34;Enough pack your backs and leave my house this instant!&#34; Viola stiffens a laugh, looks at me with a grin, and says silently &#34;Take that bitch&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought he was talking to me, &#34;But, I...&#34; I try to defend myself before Alessandro interrupts me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was talking to Miss Viola, I just had enough of the drama she caused here. I give you five minutes before I throw you out myself&#34;. Viola&#39;s smile fades as she looks at Alessandro shocked before saying, &#34;But she pushed me down the stairs, Mr. Mancini, the last few days she&#39;s been making my life hell, saying I should stay away from you.....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t believe what I&#39;m hearing, how dare she turn this around on me!. &#34;I know the truth Miss Viola, next time make sure about your surroundings, I heard the conversations between you and Miss Mancini, I heard how you were planning for all of this to happen. Now let me make it clear, so you will understand, I.WILL. NOT. LEAVE.MY.WIFE.FOR.YOU!&#34; Alessandro shouts angrily. Viola looks at me and says, &#34;You think just because you win you all that but let me tell you something your brat of a sister is better off dead than with you.&#34; I saw red when I heard what Viola just said and walked up to her and punched her straight in the face, &#34;Don&#39;t you ever dare talk about my sister again&#34;. With that, I took Lilani who was sitting on a step watching everything to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Antonio starts clapping his hands. &#34;What just happened?&#34; I asked confused. &#34;It seems that Mrs. Mancini knows how to throw a punch if needed Mr. Mancini, I think she just broke Miss Viola&#39;s nose,&#34; Antonio says laughing at the scene he just witnessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t believe what I just heard. Did she just hit someone in the face? A smile forms on my lips, knowing that my wife can defend herself if she needs to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After lunch, I ask Antonio if Viola has left the house. Antonio told me that she left while we were having lunch. &#34;Will you please call Mrs. Mancini for me Antonio?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir&#34;, Antonio answer then went to call Lisa. &#34;Alessandro, I hear you want to talk to me?&#34; I hear her. &#34;Yes, Leonardo gave a list of nannies with medical experiences, I want you to go through it, so we can hire a new nanny. I prefer an old lady if you don&#39;t mind&#34;. I told her in a stern voice. &#34;I will go through them and call them for an interview, thank you, Alessandro.&#34; I just nod before talking again, &#34;One more thing, your Italian lessons start Monday at 5:00 p.m. for two hours. I will ask Piero to take you and wait for you. It&#39;s Monday and Wednesday evenings, you may go now&#34;. I dismissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the day I phoned possible nannies to arrange interviews. I then spent some time with Lilani before dinner. Alessandro was busy handling some business until Maria came and told us dinner was ready. At the table, everyone was quiet no one said a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilani was so tired she fell asleep on her chair, I saw it and apologized then took Lilani to her room, I kissed her and turned on the night light. Going downstairs I went back to help tidy up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to take a shower when I suddenly realized this is going to be the first night I will sleep in the same bed as Alessandro. I became nervous and decided to wear my shorts and a t-shirt to bed instead of a dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I came out of the bathroom, Alessandro and Antonio walk-in. Antonio greets me and says he&#39;s just going to help Alessandro to the bathroom then he will take leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear the water in the shower and realize Alessandro is taking a shower. I wonder how he looks with water dripping from his body. Probably hot as hell, I can imagine what he looks like when standing under the shower with water running down his head over that sculpted body of his. I lick my lips and bite my bottom lip. Suddenly the door opens, and Alessandro walks out with just a towel around his waist, showing his V line. Dammit, that is hot. I can&#39;t help but stare at his perfectly toned body. Alessandro moved to his wardrobe and took a boxer with my eyes on him the whole time. My lips feel dry, so I stand up to get some water. Coming back, Alessandro was already in bed. I walked over to my side and slipped in, careful not to touch him. This is going to be a long night, I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning I wake up and feel a pair of arms around me. When I look up, I notice Alessandro. I was lying in his arms and our legs were tangled. I look at his handsome face; he has a light stubble beard forming on his face. He seems so much more relaxed when he sleeps. I was still busy studying him when he suddenly said, &#34;Are you done checking me out?&#34; I was startled when he suddenly talked, &#34;I wasn&#39;t checking you out&#34;, I tried to deny it. Alessandro laughs and says, &#34;Yes, sure you didn&#39;t; I could feel your eyes on me, Mrs. Mancini.&#34; He keeps on teasing me. I scoff and try to get up, only to be held tightly by Alessandro, who flips us over, so he was on top of me. &#34;Lisa, Lisa, what am I going to do with you?&#34; He whispers in a husky voice in my ear that sends shivers down my body, Dammit this man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He starts sucking on my neck, and a soft moan escapes my lips. He went and planted kisses along my jaw until he reached my lips and claimed it. This is my first kiss, and dammit, it feels good. The kiss became hard and urgent. I felt a sweet sensation between my legs and buck my back, and then felt something hard pocking me on my leg. I opened my eyes and saw Alessandro smirk. He pulls away, gets up, and walks to the bathroom. I was left hot and bothered in the bed thinking, &#34;wow, my first kiss was amazing&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next few days, Alessandro and I will have interviews with possible nannies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro distanced himself from me. He would go to bed late when I was already sleeping and stand up early while I was still sleeping. I know it&#39;s because of what almost happened between us the other day. I feel hurt that he treats me this way, but what else did I expect? His heart belongs to Bianca; he will never love me. I just have to get over these feelings I have towards him. We finally decided on which nanny to hire. Alessandro tells me to call the woman and inform her.</p>
