                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was busy making coffee when Antonio came in. &#34;Mrs. Mancini, Mr. Mancini wants to see you. His in the office.&#34; Antonio says. &#34;Thank you, Antonio.&#34; I walk to the office. &#34;You wanted to see me?&#34; I ask as soon as I enter. &#34;Yes, I&#39;m going out for a while. Don&#39;t wait up, and if you need anything, just call Antonio.&#34; Alessandro informs me. &#34;Alright, enjoy your evening,&#34; I said then leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Antonio and I went to the apartment where Viola lives. Antonio knocks a few times before Viola opens the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear the door open and a scream, then she puts her arms around my neck and says, &#34;I knew you would come to me; I just needed to be patient. Did you finally realize your little wife is too plain for someone with your status?&#34; She asks me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I push her away and ask Antonio to help me inside. Once inside, I say in a very cold voice, &#34;Viola, I have done some research, and I must say I found some very interesting stuff. You may think that because I am blind, I won&#39;t find out who and what you are. TSK, TSK, do you even know who I am? Because, if you did, you wouldn&#39;t have dared to cross paths with me let alone messed with my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Viola was silent for a few minutes before replying, &#34;Of course, I know who you are; you are the most powerful man in the whole of Italy; everyone fears the ruthless Alessandro Mancini, you have connections with a lot of people, even the mafia; I know there are rumors that you are also a mafia. I did all of that because I love you. I have been watching you ever since Bianca left you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, for fuck&#39;s sake, you only love the idea of my fucking money, let me tell you what I know about you, you grew up in a poor household, your father was a drunk who loved to gamble, and your mother was a crack whore who couldn&#39;t keep her legs closed even if she got paid to do it, and you began to sleep with rich married men only to blackmail them for money. I am going to give you two options: once you leave this country and never return if you do I am going to find out and then make you pay with your life, two you are going to become the whore we both know you are, and sell you to Johnny Gravano. The choice is yours. I give you ten minutes to think about it.&#34; I tell her in a cold voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear Viola gulp she knows she messed with the wrong guy and that Johnny Gravano is one of the biggest mafia known in Italy he is ruthless and doesn&#39;t give a shit about who he has to kill to get what he wants. I stood up and went outside with Antonio. I just hope she makes the right decision. Sometime later I asked Antonio to take him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you made a decision? Your time is up.&#34; I asked impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I will leave the country,&#34; Viola finally says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great, you made the right choice. I give you twenty-four hours, then I want you gone,&#34; I calmly say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up, I asked Antonio to escort me back to the car. Inside the car, I say,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Antonio keeps an eye on Viola and makes sure she leaves the country.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will do it, boss.&#34; Antonio replies, and Piero starts driving back to the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mansion, I asked Antonio to take me to my room. Antonio helps me to the bathroom and then says &#34;Good night, Mr. Mancini&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod and say, Goodnight, Antonio.&#34; I take a shower and think about today&#39;s events. Viola has tested my patients, I will not tolerate anyone who messes with me or my family. I&#39;m known to be ruthless, and I have been associated with the mafia. I may not be in the mafia, but I have a few best friends who are in the mafia, they have been friends for as long as he can remember. Johnny, Kevin Salvatore, Jake Bilotti, and I grew up together; we were best friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I lost my eyes, I started hanging out with them less; they would always call to check up on me, I have to admit I miss them; maybe I should stop pushing everyone away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only ones I can&#39;t push away are my brother, Sophia, and grandparents. They just don&#39;t listen to me when they come here whenever they want. Sophia is Kevin&#39;s little sister. She and Gabriele were inseparable since they were small. Gabriele always took her sweets or teased her until she cried. I always told Kevin that Sophia and Gabriele will get married, but then Kevin would threaten Gabriel saying he would chop off his manhood if he touches his sister, eventually Kevin got used to the idea of Gabriele and Sophia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to bed and then turned toward Lisa. I know I don&#39;t love her, but I get this urge to protect her at all costs. If only I could see her. I can&#39;t wait for the eye operation. Only Antonio and Leonardo know about the operation that will soon take place. I don&#39;t want to tell anybody else if the operation doesn&#39;t work. I don&#39;t want pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should probably tell Lisa about everything except the operation. With that thought, I fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, I woke up with Alessandro&#39;s arms around me. Carefully not to wake him. I removed his hand and went to the bathroom, once I&#39;m finished I go downstairs to prepare breakfast, just as I was finished everyone was seated at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today is Saturday, and I want to take Lilani to the park. &#34;Alice, I&#39;m taking Lilani to the park later if you want to come along.&#34; I tell her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Mrs. Mancini; I will love to go along&#34;. Alice replies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please call me Lisa, you make me feel old calling me Mrs. Mancini.&#34; Alice laughs but agrees to call me by my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa, when breakfast is finished I would like to talk to you,&#34; Alessandro says. Breakfast was finished, and I went with Alessandro to his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would like to invite some of my friends over, but first I have to tell you who and what they are,&#34; Alessandro says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, you make it sound like they are serial killers.&#34; I joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have three best friends; they will look like they are bad, but once you get to know them, you will like them. I trust them with my life. We grew up together.&#34; Alessandro tells me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I would love to meet them. When do you want to invite them over?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow, we can have a BBQ.&#34; He informs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alright, I will get everything we need,&#34; I say once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more thing, all three of them are mafia members.&#34; I look at Alessandro, trying to process what he just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They won&#39;t harm you, Lisa; like I said, I trust them with my life,&#34; Alessandro says when I don&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I trust you,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, and from now on, you don&#39;t have to worry about Viola.&#34; I heard him say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? What happened?&#34; I asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro shook his head and replied, &#34;Last night I went over to her apartment and told her to leave this country forever.&#34; He tells me as if it&#39;s something he&#39;s used to doing. I know there&#39;s more to the story, but don&#39;t ask further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see. Thank you, Alessandro,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to leave, I asked, &#34;Do you want to go with us to the park today?&#34; Alessandro runs his hands through his hair before saying, &#34;I would love to; thank you for inviting me&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma and grandpa ask if they could come along before they head back to their home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would love for you to come along.&#34; I smile at Grandma. At the park, Lilani takes Alessandro&#39;s hand and leads him to the swing. Grandma, grandpa, Alice, and I watch as Alessandro pushes Lilani on one of the swings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They love each other,&#34; Grandpa says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Lilani is very fond of Alessandro, and it seems he&#39;s fond of her as well,&#34; I say watching as Lilani laughs and notices the smile on Alessandro&#39;s face. It&#39;s a good thing I invited him. Lilani enjoys the park very much. She loves the pond, where she can feed the ducks. I made us a picnic basket, and we enjoyed lunch here in the park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for the picnic, Lisa; this was delicious,&#34; Alessandro tells me. I smile and tell Lilani to get ready. Four hours later, we decide to go back to the mansion for Lilani to take a rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will be going as well, Lisa, my dear. Take good care of this hard head, please.&#34; I hear Grandma say this when we are at the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will, I promise. Thank you guys for everything.&#34; I smiled sadly. I can&#39;t believe how much they have grown on me in such a short period of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilani, my dear child, take care, and as soon as you can travel, I will come and get you to visit us,&#34; Grandma tells Lilani.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodbye grandma, grandpa. I&#39;m going to miss you,&#34; Lilani says as she hugs them. I took Lilani&#39;s hand and watched the two old people greet Alessandro and get into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alright, Lilani, time for a nap,&#34; I say, taking her hand. For the rest of the day, Alessandro works in his office. I went to get him when dinner was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My friends will be here tomorrow at 11:00,&#34; Alessandro informs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for letting me know,&#34; I reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, I was busy preparing for Alessandro&#39;s friends. I decided to make a potato salad and &#34;Paptert&#34;. Just as I was finishing, the doorbell rang. Wiping my hands quickly, I went to open the door, and as I opened it, three huge ass men stood in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O, I see he got himself a keeper; that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t want us around&#34;, the guy with blond hair and green eyes says. The others nodded in response, and I stepped aside so they could come inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro Mancini gets your ass down here this instant.&#34; The blond guy shouts out as Alessandro makes his appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, I&#39;m blind, not fucking deaf, Johnny&#34;, Alessandro says to the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey guys, I&#39;m glad you could make it,&#34; Alessandro tells his friends. They hug each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now will you introduce us to this beauty that opened the door for us?&#34; The guy with dark brown hair, brown eyes, and tattoos all over his arms asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa, come here, please. Guys, this is Lisa, my wife, and Lisa, these clowns here are my so-called friends, Johnny Gravano is the blond, Kevin Salvatore is the one with dark brown hair, and Jake Bilotti is the one with black hair,&#34; He introduces us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, guys, A pleasure to finally meet you.&#34; I greet them with a handshake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are honored to finally meet the girl that took Bianca&#39;s place,&#34; Johnny tells me with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilani comes down, and before I can reply, she comes standing next to Alessandro, asking, &#34;Who&#39;s yelling so loud? You know we are not deaf around here&#34;, she says with her hands on her heaps, looking at the three strange men with angry eyes before continuing, &#34;Who are you and what do you want with Ali?&#34; Lilani demands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them look at each other and start laughing at the little girl in front of them.</p>
