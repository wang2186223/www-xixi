                <p>Alessandro waits nervously for Lisa to reply. &#34;Yes, yes!! A Thousand times yes.&#34; Lisa laughs and then bent down to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought for a moment you&#39;re going to say no,&#34; Alessandro says relieved. He leans in and kisses her. Lisa let out a moan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. You have just made me the happiest man alive.&#34; Alessandro says as he pulls away. He takes her hand and helps her up. They walk hand in hand back to the tent. A waiter brings them the campaign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To us. May we grow old together.&#34; Alessandro toast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To us,&#34; Lisa replies with a smile. They eat and then Alessandro asks her to dance. They slow dance between all the roses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to marry you as soon as possible&#34;. Alessandro whispers against her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmm, that sounds like a plan.&#34; Lisa smiles dreamily. Alessandro holds her by the shoulder and looks into her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.&#34;How about tomorrow?&#34; He asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will in a heartbeat but this time I want to do things right. I want my family to be there as well.&#34; Lisa tells him. Alessandro smirks, then he takes his phone out and makes a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can come.&#34; Lisa frowns at what he said, then she hears her grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t think I&#39;m going to miss this? Did you?&#34; Lisa turns and sees her family and Alessandro&#39;s family and friends standing behind her. She looks back at Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You You planned this?&#34; She asks surprised. Alessandro rubs the back of his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I know how much this would mean to you, so I asked Sophia and Gabriele to arrange everything.&#34; Lisa gives him a big smile and jumps into his arms. &#34;Thank you so much. This means the world to me. But how did you know I would say yes?&#34; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t, I was taking a chance on us.&#34; Comes his reply. Lisa kissed him forgetting about everything around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhm, we are all here watching you guys, can you please get a room&#34;? They hear Kevin say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, my virgin eyes.&#34; Jake also comments. Everyone starts laughing at Jake. Lisa went and greeted everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O honey, I&#39;m so happy for you. And I&#39;m going to be a great-grandfather.&#34; Lisa&#39;s grandpa says then rubs Lisa&#39;s slightly swollen tummy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, let&#39;s get back to the house,&#34; Johnny says. Lisa looks at Johnny and runs to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so glad you are here,&#34; Lisa says as she hugs him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep your hands off my woman,&#34; Alessandro says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, dude! She actually gave me a hug!&#34; Johnny defends. Lisa just laughs at Alessandro. Suddenly, she catches a glimpse of Aurora, observing Johnny intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmm, this is interesting&#34;. She thought. They all walk back up to the house. Lisa can&#39;t believe her grandfather is here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone sits outside because Kevin suggests having a BBQ. Now they listen to music and everyone is chatting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa, would you like to dance with me?&#34; JP her cousin asks her. &#34;Let&#39;s show them how we South-Africans have a BBQ and dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have our music here,&#34; Lisa tells him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, he has already given me a few examples of what to play,&#34; Jake reassures. Lisa listens and recognizes Dirk Van Der Westhuizen&#39;s song Fairy Tale. &#34;This is my favorite&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lisa sings along. Alessandro observes with admiration as she gracefully dances with JP.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, they are perfect even the music just a pity I don&#39;t understand a word the guy is singing,&#34; Kevin says to them. Marna smiles, I will put everything in English subtitles, and then you can understand what he&#39;s saying, but it&#39;s not the same.&#34; Marna tells them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the song ends, Lisa walks up to Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are a great dancer.&#34; Alessandro gives her a sincere compliment. &#34;Thank you, my father taught me from a young age,&#34; Lisa says smiling as she recalls the memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;m going to learn Afrikaans,&#34; Alessandro informs her. Lisa looks up at him and smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That would be great.&#34; Grandpa stands up and walks to Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to steal her for a moment. I hope you remember how to two-step.&#34; Grandpa says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s all yours grandpa.&#34; Alessandro smiles. Lisa takes her grandfather&#39;s hand and then JP plays a klipwerf song on. Lisa and grandpa enjoy the dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For an old man, he sure can move.&#34; Jake comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I must learn how to dance like that,&#34; Aurora says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My brother can teach you, right JP?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, no problem, come let me teach you.&#34; Aurora takes JP&#39;s hand and starts teaching her. Lisa looks at Johnny and notices how jealous he gets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, is someone feeling a twinge of jealousy?&#34; Lisa teases him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What! No, I&#39;m not. I&#39;m just watching.&#34; Johnny says through gritted teeth. Lisa laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want I can also teach you, that way both can dance together.&#34; Lisa offers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sign me up&#34;. Kevin sticks his hand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me also&#34;. Jake also says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; suggests Lisa. &#34;Marna can teach Jake, and I will take care of teaching Kevin.&#34; She notices how Marna blushes when she hears what Lisa said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great let&#39;s get the next song. Do you want to two-step or &#34;Sokkie&#34;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s a &#34;Sokkie?&#34; Kevin asked. &#34;Well it&#39;s like a close dance, but you dance fast and do turns and swings. Just like JP and I did.&#34; Lisa tries her best to explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That &#34;Sokkie&#34; one.&#34; Jake and Kevin both replied. Lisa and Marna taught them how to dance, and soon they got it. She walks over to Alessandro where he is talking to grandpa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you also want to learn?&#34; Lisa asks him. Alessandro stands up and takes her hand, &#34;Of course, you are a great teacher. Looks like Kevin and Jake are enjoying it.&#34; Alessandro says nodding in the guys&#39; direction. Lisa asks JP to put a special song on for them. Karlien van Jaarsveld Hande starts to play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro smiles as he listens to the word. They danced and chatted for a while; everyone seems to enjoy the night singing and dancing. Alessandro gets up and tells them they have a big day tomorrow. Everyone said goodnight and went to their bedrooms. Lisa went into the bathroom to take a shower. She thinks about last night. She never thought that making love could bring so much pleasure just thinking about it turns her on. She&#39;s lost in thought that she didn&#39;t hear him come in but when she turns around she sees him leaning against the counter watching her. &#34;What are you doing? What are you thinking that got you smiling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come join me and I will show you&#34;. He drops his clothes and joins her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what did you want to show me?&#34; He asks her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. I just needed you to wash my back.&#34; He started to tickle her, and she laughed so hard her side started to hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little tease. Can you please hand me the sponge?&#34; After applying soap, she passed him the sponge. He turns her around and moves her hair out of the way and starts washing her back. He moves down her legs then back up to her ass. He ditches the sponge and starts using his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He washes all around her ass and between her legs. After he feels that it&#39;s clean, he uses the shower head and rinses her. Then he goes down on his knees and spreads her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put your hands on the wall&#34;. Lisa did as she&#39;s told. She let her head fall forward as he started licking her, then he slides a finger inside her and continues to lick her. Alessandro got her so excited and ready to explode. He slides another finger in her and starts rubbing her clit. Lisa comes quickly and hard. Her legs come unsteady, and she slides down to the floor. Alessandro smiles at her. He stands up and helps her up. He smashes his lips onto hers. Lisa lets out a moan and wraps her legs around his waist. Alessandro pumps in and out of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O my God, faster.&#34; Lisa moans. Alessandro picks up his pace and pumps harder and faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandro&#34;. Lisa screams and both of them come together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was amazing&#34;. Alessandro says. They wash then go to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, Alessandro.&#34; Lisa said as she lay in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too.&#34; Lisa fell asleep knowing that she and Alessandro will be a family.</p>
