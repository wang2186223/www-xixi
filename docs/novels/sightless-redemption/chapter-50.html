                <p>Lisa woke up when the door opened, and she noticed the guard she talked to walking up to her. &#34;Get ready, Alessandro will be arriving in ten minutes.&#34; The guard says. He looks at Lisa and notices how weak she is, and then he notices the blood. He bends down and picks her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to put you in this corner so if somebody wants to get you, they won&#39;t find you, I will tell your husband where you are&#34;. He talks softly and puts her down gently. Lisa nods weakly. She doesn&#39;t have any energy left in her body. She just wishes Alessandro would hurry and rescue her sister. She doesn&#39;t think her body is strong enough to escape. Lisa closed her eyes, praying her sister would be fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everyone ready? You all know what to do. We need to ensure a safe and swift evacuation for Lilani and Lisa.&#34; Johnny tells his guys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are going in five, and the driver is ready. Let us know when you find them&#34;. He continues. Alessandro&#39;s impatience grows as he yearns to swiftly retrieve his wife. However, he is acutely aware of the perilous nature of this rescue mission and dreads the thought of Lisa or Lilani coming to harm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready? Go, go!&#34; Alessandro listens closely as Johnny commands. They sneak up to the building where Lisa and Lilani are and take out the guards at the door. Johnny opens the door and clears the way. Soon they are inside, searching for Lisa and Lilani.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kevin, you and Jake go and find Lilani, while Alessandro and I will search for Lisa,&#34; Johnny tells the over-the-earpiece. Johnny and Alessandro went up the stairs and started searching each room for Lisa. In every room, they find a few young girls, and Alessandro shows one of their men to take the women out. In the meantime, Kevin and Jake discover where Lilani and other children are being held and talk to the frightened girls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Girls, don&#39;t worry; we are here to help you get home. Now that we don&#39;t have much time, you need to listen carefully. You see the guy over there? Follow him quietly. Please, don&#39;t make a sound.&#34; Kevin tells them. The girls nod and start to line up, ready to follow Jake and the others. Lilani notices Kevin and Jake and runs up to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve truly missed all of you.&#34; She whispers to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We missed you too; you have to follow us so that we can get out of here,&#34; Jake tells Lilani. Lilani follows Kevin and Jake as they go down and see some guards walking up the hallway. Kevin shows Jake and the guys how to go into a room. They quickly went into the nearest room while Kevin attacked the guards quietly so that nobody could hear they were there. He quickly dragged the bodies into another room, closed the door, and went to get the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandro and Johnny go into the room and find Lisa curled up in the corner. Alessandro runs up to her and sees that she is weak and bleeding. He quickly takes off his jacket and puts it around her, then picks her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to move now before someone notices us,&#34; Johnny says to Alessandro. Alessandro nods, then walks towards the door. He looks outside, sees that the coast is clear, and starts walking downstairs with Johnny following. Just as they reached the last step, they heard Mr. Lombardi speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well, isn&#39;t this lovely look who decided to come and play the hero?&#34; Alessandro freezes and looks up to Mr. Lombardi, who is holding a gun and pointing it at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know you should have just taken my daughter back, but no, you had to go and fall in love with this girl. You and your friends ruined me. Now, what am I going to do with you?&#34; Mr. Lombardi asks Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave Lisa and her sister out of this; this is between me and Bianca. You should have never interfered in the first place.&#34; Alessandro says it through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that&#39;s where you are wrong because you hurt my little girl the day you married Lisa. Bianca loved you, and you were too blind to see it, blinded by that woman&#39;s beauty.&#34; Mr. Lombardi says this and points the gun at Lisa. Alessandro turns around so that if he pulls the trigger, he won&#39;t hit Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I give you five seconds to choose either Bianca or Lisa. If you choose Lisa, I will take her away from you. That&#39;s a promise. I sincerely hope that you make a wise choice.&#34; Alessandro turns his head and looks at Lombardi before saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will never leave my wife for someone like your daughter,&#34; Lombardi smirks at Alessandro and says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it looks like you will see each other on the other side then.&#34; Lisa, who hears every word, looks up at Alessandro and says, &#34;Alessandro, please don&#39;t do this; go and be happy. I will never forgive myself if something happens to you because of me.&#34; Alessandro looks down at his beautiful wife, saying</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will never leave you again. I thought I could protect you if I left you. Not only that, but I love you, Lisa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aww, isn&#39;t this cute, confessing your love? Such a sweet gesture, but unfortunately, it&#39;s too late.&#34; Mr. Lombardi says just as he pulls the trigger Johnny pushes Alessandro out of the way. Alessandro holds on to Lisa as he feels himself falling and uses his body to protect her. Soon another gunshot goes off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin and Jake made it out of the place safely with all the children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going back for Lisa and the others&#39;&#39;. Jake tells Kevin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be careful&#34;. Jake nods and runs back to the house just as he wants to enter. As soon as he heard the gunshot, he swiftly made his way indoors. In a split second, he witnessed Johnny forcefully pushing Alessandro aside and, to his astonishment, he caught a glimpse of Lombardi standing at the top of the stairs. Just as Lombardi was about to pull the trigger again. Jake aims at Lombardi and shoots him in the head. He quickly ran towards Johnny and noticed he had been shot in the back. He takes out his phone and daily Kevin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Prepare the cars immediately. Johnny has been shot. He needs a doctor asap. He&#39;s losing a lot of blood.&#34; Jake hangs up and starts to put pressure on the wound. Alessandro gets up, then helps Lisa up. They walk towards Johnny and see what happened. After a few minutes, Kevin arrives with some men and starts helping Johnny to one of the cars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take him to my place; the doctor is already waiting there,&#34; Kevin informs them. Alessandro picks Lisa up and walks towards the cars. He notices that she&#39;s losing a lot of blood and tells the driver to drive faster to the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lisa, baby, open your eyes, please.&#34; He begs her. Lisa hears Alessandro&#39;s voice but struggles to open her eyes. Alessandro dials his doctor and tells him to meet him at Kevin&#39;s place and that he must hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they arrive, Alessandro takes Lisa inside and rushes with her to a room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Mancini let me take it from here I will inform you as soon as I&#39;m done with my examination on Mrs. Mancini.&#34; The doctor informs him. Alessandro went outside and decided to go to hear how Johnny is doing. When he went to Kevin and Jake they told him Johnny is still with the doctors that they are still busy with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Lilani?&#34;. Alessandro asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is fine; she&#39;s sleeping in one of the guest rooms,&#34; Kevin assures him. The three of them wait for news on Johnny and Lisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some time, the doctor walks towards Alessandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Mancini, I&#39;m sorry, but it looks like Mrs. Mancini lost the baby. I can&#39;t say for sure, but she lost a lot of blood.&#34; The doctor informs Alessandro. Alessandro is too shocked to register what the doctor said. He walked past the doctor and went to Lisa&#39;s room and took a seat next to her. He takes her hand in his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am so sorry for everything I have done these past few weeks, sorry for not trusting you enough. I thought I was protecting you, but I ended up hurting you more than anyone had ever done. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I love you so much.&#34; Alessandro says with tears running down his cheeks.</p>
