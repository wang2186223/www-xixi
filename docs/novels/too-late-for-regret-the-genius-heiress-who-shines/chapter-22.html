                <p>Evelina gave a nod, her expression one of relief.&#34;That&#39;s good to hear. I really need some peace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dealing with Cary wasn&#39;t on her agenda right now.He had ignored her urgent calls previously, choosing instead to tend to his mistress. And now, he was desperately searching for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided she would deal with him later, after she had taken enough time to rest and recharge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper exited the room, a slight smile touching his lips,seemingly in high spirits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina then settled into a deep sleep for a couple of hours. Upon awakening, she felt revitalized and notably hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She enjoyed a light meal, feeling much better afterward. It was then that she turned her attention to her phone, which had run out of battery. After charging it and powering it on, she was met wvith a flood of notifications-Cary and his mother had called her over a hundred times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It appeared that the mother and son duo had relentlessly called her phone until it finally gave out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing not to call anyone back just yet, Evelina noted a slew of text messages that she assumed were filled with nothing positive. She promptly deleted them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then noticed a missed call from &#34;Caleb Quinn&#34;among her logs. Curious, she returned the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,Caleb.What&#39;s up?&#34; she inquired, keeping her tone light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the other line was brimming wvith frustration. &#34;Didn&#39;t Lena inform you of my arrival today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was taken aback. &#34;Sorry, what now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been at the airport since I landed! Just getting youur call back now? If you don&#39;t pick me up soon, I&#39;ll report you for emotional distress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cringing, Evelina realized she had completely spaced on the divorce lawyer Lena had scheduled to come into town,especially with her recent illness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My apologies, I&#39;mon my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have half an hour!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb, despite his youth, was one of the youngest to make senior partner at his law firm. However, he could still throw fits that would rival any teenager. Evelina quickly dressed and made her way down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie,lounging in the living room, instantly perked up at the sound of Evelina&#39;s steps. &#34;Evi, is that you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s me, Florrie,&#34; Evelina responded warmly. &#34;I have to run out for a little while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Florrie immediately wanted to join. But she had just undergone all the medical tests, so Jasper didn&#39;t allow her to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie pouted, folding her arms. &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll stay. But only if Uncle goes with you. I won&#39;t worry then!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie had assumed the role of Evelina&#39;s unofficial protector, which was both endearing and amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be absurd,&#34; Jasper said with a soothing tone.&#34;It&#39;s not certain that Evelina would want me tagging along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not an option!&#34; Florrie clung to Evelina,mimicking a koala&#39;s embrace. &#34;It&#39;s either me or Uncle Jasper who accompanies you,Evi.Make your choice!&#34; Consequently,Evelina found herself in the car with Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She initially aimed for the front seat but discovered it was already occupied by a bodyguard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slightly embarrassed, she closed the door and joined Jasper in the backseat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Jasper browsed a financial newspaper, he inquired casually, &#34;Who are we fetching?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina presumed he was asking for security purposes and openly replied, &#34;It&#39;s my brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually related by blood?&#34; Jasper&#39;s interest was piqued, his brow lifting. Her file didn&#39;t indicate she had siblings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He and I shared the same orphanage. He was adopted by a family in lreah at twelve and eventually became a lawyer. I&#39;ve asked him to manage my divorce proceedings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left out the part about Caleb being gravely injured in an accident as a teenager, which resulted in blindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was around the time she first met Professor Landen Mitchell during a visit to Caleb. Mitchell,recognizing her potential in medicine, chose to mentor her, making her his last student.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb&#39;s initial eye surgery was the first Evelina assisted with. Since that surgery, Caleb had viewed her as his elder sister, showing nothing but absolute loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper noted the tight bond between Evelina and Caleb, detecting a hint of envy in his own voice as he said, &#34;You two seem... close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina responded casually, clarifying their connection with a lightness in her tone, &#34;We&#39;re not related by blood, but yes, we&#39;re closer than many siblings are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried a warmth that spoke of genuine familial love, akin to the way Jasper felt about Florrie,pure and straightforward. He remained silent for the rest of the drive until they reached the airpoort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arrival, Jasper caught sight of Caleb for the first time. The young man was impressively handsome,exuding a charm that seemed to captivate those around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evi!&#34; Caleb called out joyfully as soon as he spotted her. Noticing Jasper beside her, his expression shifted slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a moment&#39;s delay, Caleb approached swiftly,enveloped Evelina in a hug, and lifted her off her feet,spinning her around in a demonstrative greeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s tone carried a hint of caution as he said, &#34;Ms.Marsh has just recovered from being unwell. Perhaps it&#39;s best not to be too rough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were sick?&#34; Caleb&#39;s concern was immediate as he set Evelina down, his expression filled with worry.He kept one arm around her protectively. &#34;How serious was it? Are you okay now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina reassured him with a grateful smile. &#34;I&#39;m much better, thanks to Mr. Russell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb then turned to Jasper, extending a hand in greeting. &#34;So, this is Jasper Russell from Ireah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper confirmed with a firm nod. &#34;Yes, that&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their handshake was more than a simple greeting;it was a silent battle of wills. Despite Jasper&#39;s calm exterior, honed by his military background, Caleb&#39;s grip was firm, his body tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere was charged with tension, evident even to the bystanders at the airport.</p>
