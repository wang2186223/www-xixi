                <p>Millie held back the weight in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven years. So much had happened, and so much had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had made her choices then. And now, she was making new ones-ones that didn&#39;t look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Brandon had truly loved each other once.That part was real. And no matter how things ended,she didn&#39;t regret it. But the love they shared had ended. She had nothing left to give him-no more time, no more pieces of her body or heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Millie turned,ready to walk into the mansion.But Brandon reached for her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34; he said again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice came softer now. &#34;You were never replaceable. Vivian only has six months left. When it&#39;s over, everything can go back to how it was. You don&#39;t need to keep making things difficult. Everything will boe fine in six months.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words made her stop and laugh, quietly, bitterly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was what he thought? That she was being difficult? That she was stirring up trouble-for a man or a title she no longer wanted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still didn&#39;t understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never chased the Watson name. She never needed the position of his wife. She was Millie Bennett, the daughter of a legacy that mattered long before he entered her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once,she stayed by his side out of love for him. Now,she was Millie Bennett again, and she stood here alone out of love for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had given him chances, more than she should have. Each time, she&#39;d looked for clarity, for a reason to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And each time, his words cut deeper than the last.She had had enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy who once shielded her in that rainy night years ago had never grown up with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He belonged to the past. The Brandon standing here,with eyes full of someone else, was a stranger. She no longer wanted this version of Brandon. He wasn&#39;t the boy etched in her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go,&#34; she said sharply. But he didn&#39;t. His grip on her wrist stayed firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie,&#34; he said, &#34;what is it that you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to take back her father&#39;s legacy. She wanted answers about his death. She wanted to rise again in her own name, protect the people she cared about, and leave Brandon behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hovered in her throat,heavy and real. But she didn&#39;t say them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were still in the middle of a divorce. She needed it to go through cleanly. Angering Brandon now would only slow things down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So instead, she said, cool and even, &#34;Brandon,my life isn&#39;t your business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That did it. He snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night breeze swept between them,carrying the scent of her perfume. It made her feel like someone he no longer knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not my business?&#34; he said, his voice rough. &#34;You&#39;re still my wife. You think none of this matters to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie gave a dry laugh. &#34;So you do remember I&#39;m your wife now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go,&#34; she said again, trying to pull her hand free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their voices rose, sharp and fast, echoing across the quiet night. Until another voice spoke. &#34;Enough!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s voice, firm and clear, rang from the direction of the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was as displeased as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon! What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; Derek barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s jaw clenched. Still, he didn&#39;t look away from Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon!&#34; Derek snapped again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Brandon shifted his gaze, his eyes hard but lowered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa,&#34; he muttered. But his hand still hadn&#39;t let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s eyes were cold, aimed straight at Brandon.Beside him,Norma reached for Millie&#39;s hand with quiet worry. &#34;Oh, my dear,&#34; she murmured. &#34;You&#39;ve lost so much weight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All because of this fool!&#34; Derek snapped. He raised his walking stick, the veins on his hand visible with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t move. He stood rooted to the spot,the wind from the lake brushing past them, carrying a whisper of cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie pulled her coat tighter around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon noticed. His brows drew together slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she cold?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something stirred in him-a feeling that something had changed in ways he hadn&#39;t yet figured out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could hear you two from inside!&#34; Derek roared,swinging the stick at Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, after all the nonsense you&#39;ve pulled, you still have the nerve to fight with Millie? Sometimes I wonder how someone like you could come from my own blood. His voice grew more angry. &#34;If your parents weren&#39;t off gallivanting abroad, if | wvasn&#39;t stuck in this state, I&#39;d show you what real consequences look like!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A year ago, his health had been in decline. Millie and Brandon&#39;s wedding had brought him a bit of joy,something to cling to. But now,he looked worse than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now all you do is ignore your wife and chase after another woman, dragging our family name through the mud! Have you forgotten the vows you made on your knees when you brought Millie into this house? Don&#39;t you feel a shred of guilt?&#34; Derek&#39;s words dissolved into violent coughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa!&#34; Millie and Brandon both stepped forward,but Derek waved Brandon off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie reached for the old man, rubbing his back gently to make him better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could still feel the warmth of those who had treated her with genuine kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might have closed the door on Brandon, but she couldn&#39;t turn her back on Derek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek&#39;s coughs worsened, and Brandon immediately called for the family doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the villa, the family doctor rushed in and did what he could to calm Derek&#39;s breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After checking his vitals, the doctor said, &#34;Mr.Watson&#39;s been in a much better shape over the past year. As long as he avoids stress like this, he&#39;ll be fine.So please don&#39;t push him again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Derek had been helped back into bed, Norma led them out into the hallway. Her face was tight with disapproval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon,&#34; she said, &#34;how long do you plan to keep this up with Vivian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t answer.His head was bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norma was clearly disappointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re no longer a little boy,&#34; she said quietly with a sigh. &#34;And yes, you&#39;ve made Watson Group stronger than ever. People say you&#39;ve outpaced even the Evans and Elliott families. Clearly, you know what you&#39;re doing in business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let that hang in the air for a moment before adding, &#34;But with all that wisdom, can&#39;t you spare a little thought for your wife? Millie stood by you. You were the one who brought her to us. You promised her a home. Do you not care about the mess you&#39;ve made of her reputation? Do you not care how she feels?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,Brandon said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His silence only deepened the lines of disappointment on Norma&#39;s face. &#34;I was going to eat with you both,&#34;she said. &#34;But now, I&#39;ll leave you to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Millie&#39;s hand a squeeze and cast one last disappointed look at Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek had shouted, even struck Brandon. But still, they were all out of ways to make him come to his senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should both stay,&#34; she added after a breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your grandfather still wants to talk to you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned to Brandon alone, her tone hard.&#34;You&#39;ll spend the night here tonight. Do you hear me?&#34;</p>
