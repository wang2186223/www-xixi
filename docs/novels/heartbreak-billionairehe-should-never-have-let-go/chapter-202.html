                <p>Myron looked at Millie, and in that quiet moment,it felt as though everything else had faded away,and it was just the two of them left in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft breeze blew strands of her hair, and the warmth from his hand ran through her, stirring a feeling she couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,he smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile lit up his face and he looked genuinely happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed on one knee, looking up at her with eyes that held nothing but affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, he saw it. After all this time, he caught a glimpse of affection in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t mere gratitude, compatibility, or friendship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was real affection towards him. It passed quickly, but that fleeting moment alone made him very happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If love meant lowvering himself completely, then he would gladly stay at her feet, just for the chance to be close to her heart.</p>

                <p>It was the first time in days she had seen him shine with such warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His usual calm and polished air was gone, and his eyes was now filled with raw, intense emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing restrained about it. For the first time, she saw a firm, possessive look in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made her feel inexplicably shy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes dropped, and she turned her head, unable to hold his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron rose to his feet and stood beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He towered over her small frame, so he could easily wrap her in his arms. He stared down at her, taking her in. The wind tousled her hair, and her lashes dipped when she dropped her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt a sudden urge to pull her into his arms, but he held back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then said, &#34;The weather is nice tonight, and the breeze feels good. Want to keep walking for a bit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he reach out, offering his open palm to her. His hand was large and the lines across it were etched clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted slightly as she hesitated for a moment, but then slowly placed her hand into his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wrapped his fingers around hers firmly, his eyes crinkling with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie kept her head down, too shy to look up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked hand in hand for a while, and passed by a small food stall. The stall was run by a couple, both occupied with work, while a child slept inside a nearby tent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with the couple moving busily around the stall,the child remained fast asleep, undisturbed by the noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie glanced over, and Myron turned to her with a suggestion. &#34;Want to get some snacks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sounds good,&#34; Millie responded. The drinks from earlier, combined with their walk, had left her a little hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They bought some chicken and fries from the couple and found a stone block nearby to sit on. They then wore disposable gloves and startedeating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Myron like this made Millie burst into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked over at her with cheeks puffed out with food,wondering what she found so funny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie took a good look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his luxury watch and custom suit to the shimmering cufflinks on his sleeves, everything about Myron screamed elegance. Yet now, he sat beside her on a stone block, casually munching on fried chicken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34; she said, smiling. &#34;You just feel a lot more down-to-earth right now, not so much like the untouchable CEO you usually seem to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He no longer came across as the unreachable CEO of a gemstone empire. Sitting beside her like this, he felt more like someone she could truly know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That invisible wall between them seemed to shrink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After swallowing his bite, Myron said, &#34;Back when I spent time at sea for work, there were times we barely had enough to eat. I had to make do with whatever we had.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went on, &#34;Most of the food on the ship were bland, canned meals. So whenever we docked,we&#39;d rush out to find something decent to eat. Street food always tasted incredible in those moments.&#34; He spoke,reaching for a napkin to wipe sauce off her lips. &#34;Still, nothing beats the variety of dishes from home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, his expression changed. His face tensed for a second, and his lips twitched slightly, as though he recalled an unpleasant memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Millie asked softly, taking the napkin from his hand to wipe her mouth, confused by his change in demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just thought of some truly terrible cooking attempts by two certain people...&#34; Myron said, clearly referring to Jayceon&#39;s and Adriana&#39;s infamous kitchen disasters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie caught on right away and gave a knowing nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered Jayceon&#39;s confident attempt at cooking when she last visited the Elliott Mansion. He had insisted on preparing his signature dish, only to end up burning something as basic as scrambled eggs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they continued eating, their conversation moved to lighter topics. The night breeze brushed past them gently, and both of them looked completely at ease in each other&#39;s company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, the couple who owned the stall finally wrapped up for the night and walked over to check on their sleeping child, speaking to each other in hushed tones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Millie nor Myron noticed the black Rolls-Royce parked around the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Egbert sat looking through a set of photos he had just taken, letting out a resigned sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had originally planned to get some praise from Millie once she sent Ari back, especially after setting up a poll that could sway opinion and bring attention to the Blue series.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But while waiting near the children&#39;s home, he hadn&#39;t expected to see what he did. Myron crouched down and was tying Millie&#39;s shoelaces. Now, they were sharing late-night snacks together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They really do look like they belong together..&#34;Egbert muttered with a sigh. I thought I was fast enough, but Myron you crafty fox.. You beat me to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flipped through the photos again, watching the scene play out frame by frame. The two had just finished eating and were now getting up to toss their trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t bear this frustration alone,&#34; Egbert grumbled.He scrolled through his contacts, found the one he had in mind, and sent over the pictures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Brandon had returned to his apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lay sprawled on the couch, eyes fixed on the pale ceiling above him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For days, the same question had been circling his thoughts. The one he asked Rita, hoping she could offer him some advice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If all he was capable of was bringing pain to Millie, would it be better to just let her go?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone vibrated twice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon reached for it and saw a message from Egbert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t be the only one seeing this. Take a look,&#34; the message read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attached were several photos of Millie and Myron together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In each one, she wore a radiant smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon brushed his fingers over her smiling face with an aching heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t bring himself to let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was supposed to be his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her smile like that at someone else simply felt unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Myron had already seen Millie home  safely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, he made sure to walk her all the way to her floor, not wanting a repeat of the uninvited encounter with Brandon from before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to step through her door,Myron called out softly, &#34;Millie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused and turned to him. &#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d like to move up the date of our third meeting.Would that be alright?&#34; he asked with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded. &#34;That&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great. I&#39;ll send you the details soon,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Millie replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Myron reached out. He hesitated for a moment, but went ahead and touched her cheek.&#34;Goodnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking into the depth of his eyes, Millie whispered,&#34;Goodnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie went inside, and Myron turned to the elevator and left the building, only to find Brandon standing close by, watching.</p>
