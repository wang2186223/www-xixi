                <p>Evans Entertainment kept Millie&#39;s identity as Eva locked under a strict confidentiality agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To shield her from exposure, all contact with Eva was routed through Charles&#39; team, ensuring nothíng about Eva would lead to Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, Millie had asked Charles about Vivian&#39;s string of phone numbers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian maintained several external lines, but the one she&#39;d used to reach Serena-the same she used to call Eva now-was registered under someone else&#39;s name. Vivian clearly took her precautions seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a moment to gather her thoughts, Millie answered the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s voice crackled through the line. &#34;Eva? It&#39;s Vivian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coughing lightly, Millie feigned a lingering cold,pitching her voice low and scratchy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; she rasped, shooting Ari a quick look before slipping onto the balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you checked out the trending topics today?&#34;Vivian&#39;s tone brimmed with self-satisfaction, as if she&#39;d been waiting all day to gloat over her handiwork. This had clearly been a plan in the making.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie slid the balcony door shut behind her and spoke in a rough voice, &#34;I saw everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s tone sharpened, brimming with self-assurance. &#34;So, are you finally willing to hand it over?If you&#39;re smart about this, I&#39;ll see to it you get paid handsomely-and I&#39;ll even help you launch your own brand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not once did Vivian mention &#34;credit&#34; directly. She skirted the word, talking only in careful code.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie saw right through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a low, scratchy laugh, Millie remarked, &#34;If you mean credit, just say it. Why bother with all these charades?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>川 never said anything about credit. If you want to twist my words, there&#39;s nothing I can do about that,&#34;Vivian deflected without missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly circled back, laying on the enticement.&#34;Let&#39;s get back to the point. Eva, you must realize-Charles and Millie are thick as thieves. Evans Entertainment is only going to pour resources into her.Helping Charles will get you nowhere.Partnering with me, though, that&#39;s your boest move. And about your contract drama with the Evans? Watson Group can make all that disappear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spoke as if the deal was already done, certain Eva would cave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie&#39;s ragged voice cut in coldly, &#34;I told you, l&#39;m not selling it. No means no. Vivian, are you even aware that you&#39;re breaking the law?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian let out a cool laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not breaking any laws, she replied her voice dropping to a low, confident pitch. Let&#39;s be blunt-who actually cares what you say online? None of it matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, her tone growing a shade sharper.&#34;Besides, I haven&#39;t done a thing wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie instantly caught the subtext.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Eva&#39;s name had already been tacked onto the official credits for both lyrics and melody of &#34;Glimmer of Love.&#34; With Vivian&#39;s relentless PR blitz,public opinion had shifted-most people believed Eva had made a minor contribution, while Vivian was celebrated as the true genius behind the song.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s PR machine was ruthless. If Eva ever tried to defend herself, Vivian could easily paint her as a grasping nobody who wanted all the glory despite barely helping at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was how the weight of the public opinion could suffocate a lesser-known musician like Eva.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the line went quiet, Vivian&#39;s lips curled in a smug smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d already mapped out every angle-if Eva dared produce evidence of copyright, Vivian could just insist the recording originated in Evans Entertainment&#39;s studio, and that, as a clueless newcomer, she&#39;d only invited Eva to help her rehearse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would then claimed Eva had handled the copyright registration for her. As for why Vivian&#39;s name didn&#39;t appear on the paperwork, she could always accuse Eva of exploiting a loophole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such dispute would have to be settled in court, and that kind of legal battle dragged on for ages. By the time the truth came out, Eva would&#39;ve missed her chance to turn things around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian spoke with a slick, practiced confidence. &#34;So,have you made up your mind? If you&#39;re willing to work with me, you can still walk away with something. Wait too long, and you&#39;ll get nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie only laughed. &#34;Not interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian seemed genuinely surprised. &#34;Eva, come on.Even if you take this to court, at worst, I pay a penalty and move on. The lawsuit will take forever. Why not just take the money and the resources I&#39;m offering?It&#39;s a win-win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t bother replying. She ended the call, her smile lingering as she stared at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie knew Vivian was relentless, and she also knew Vivian wouldn&#39;t back down so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of her was almost eager to see what reckless move Vivian would make next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Vivian could plausibly argue she hadn&#39;t intended to infringe-that she believed she&#39;d bought the song and had every reason to call it her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, Vivian was well aware she was in the wrong.She still refused to admit fault or apologize, doubling down and scrambling to muddy the truth by tacking Eva&#39;s name onto the credits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was a crucial distinction-deliberate infringement meant far steeper penalties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie considered Brandon&#39;s temperament. If he sensed any real threat to a project, he&#39;d cut his losses without hesitation. But what if Vivian insisted on charging ahead regardless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s lips curved in a cold, inward smile. &#34;Fine,then. You&#39;re asking for whatever comes next, Vivian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her right hand into a tight fist, steadying herself, and then slipped back into the hospital room and forced her mind back to the task at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just a few days, the Elliott Group&#39;s first wave of new products would hit the shelves. She had a launch to orchestrate-and she intended for it to be a resounding success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After several days of rest and treatment, Brandon&#39;s strength had finally returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat up, the lines of fatigue on his face graduallying, and tapped his index finger against the tablet in his lap-a new version of &#34;Glimmer of Love&#34; filling the screen. Vivian hovered beside him, all innocence and wide-eyed charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what exactly are you trying to pull?&#34; Brandon&#39;s voice was low, edged with exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian met his gaze, a mask of sweet innocence firmly in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, I already added her name, didn&#39;t l?&#34; she said, blinking as if genuinely baffled. &#34;Didn&#39;t you say there were issues with infringement? Well,now that her name&#39;s there, isn&#39;t it resolved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon pressed his fingers to his temple, already feeling the dull throb of a headache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not how it works. The right of authorship is rightfully hers and hers alone, Vivian. This isn&#39;t about simply tacking her name on after.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian paused, and then slipped her arm through his and gently guided him to sit on the couch beside her. Listen, Brandon,&#34; she began, her tone soft but determined. &#34;You&#39;re missing the point. If we leave only Eva&#39;s name on the credits, it&#39;s basically admitting the infringement was real in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone turned grave as she went on, &#34;If I do that,everything I&#39;ve worked for-my entire public persona -will go up in smoke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, her gaze unwavering. &#34;And it means lose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon knew exactly what she meant. That was why he&#39;d tried to persuade Eva into signing a non-disclosure agreement. But with Eva refusing, the issue remained a ticking time bomb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Brandon, the only way to cut their losses was to pull the plug on the &#34;Love of Vivian&#34; project entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian, however, wouldn&#39;t budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole mess left Brandon massaging his temples,exhaustion in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian studied him, lips curling into a measured smile. &#34;I&#39;ve added Eva&#39;s name now, haven&#39;t l? I&#39;m not shutting her out-I&#39;m giving her credit for her work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried a brisk finality. &#34;We pay her, we offer her some resources. With her name on the song and money in her pocket, there&#39;s no reason for her to feel slighted anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashing a practiced smile, she stated firmly,&#34;Brandon, this is the best possible outcome-for all of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s gaze flickered with unease as he studied Vivian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could see her entire scheme teetered on one condition-Eva&#39;s cooperation. Without it, they were wide open to accusations of infringement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, are you still set on pushing ahead with the &#39;Love of Vivian&#39; project?&#34; he asked, his tone careful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s answer came without hesitation. &#34;I am.&#34; Her chin lifted, her defiance unyielding. &#34;Brandon, I&#39;m not backing down. Even if you walk away, I&#39;ll keep moving forward on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her, &#34;Love of Vivian&#34; wasn&#39;t just another project-it was her one shot at making it big.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eva, on the other hand, was nobody important-a struggling singer forced to hawk her songs for a living, even enduring the sweltering heat in a suffocating mascot costume justto scrape by. The image flashed in Vivian&#39;s mind and only hardened her resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As far as Vivian was concerned, Eva was just stalling,angling for a bigger payout before she caved. This drawn-out battle of wills was nothing more than posturing for leverage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Vivian&#39;s mind, there was no real threat here.Sooner or later, Eva would fold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Handling her would be a breeze.</p>
