                <p>Millie twirled beneath the shifting lights, a genuine smile lighting her face as she moved with the music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, she allowed herself to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most days, she was constantly occupied. For seven relentless years, her world had revolved around Brandon-managing Watson Group affairs, juggling Bennett family obligations, darting from city to city on business trips, or spending long evenings at the Moonlit Estate making sure the elders were comfortable. Whenever she found a spare moment,she busied herself perfecting herhome with Brandon or mastering some new skill she thought would help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evenings out with her friends like this, echoing their carefree youth, were a rarity now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And coming to a place like the Blue Lounge? That was practically unheard of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, as she sipped her drink and laughed with her friends, she realized she actually enjoyed herself -at least in small doses. The blaring music and crowded dance floor were tolerable for a night,but she had no desire to make it a habit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Millie lost herself in the rhythm, her thoughts began to drift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp hand suddenly clamped around her arm,jarring her back to the present. She stiffened and spun around,bracing herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stood in front of her, his jawclenched tight,fury etched into every line of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie yanked her arm back, but Brandon clamped down and dragged her straight off the dance floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles had vanished to the bar to get them drinks,nowhere in sight to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon steered Millie down a side hallway, his grip punishing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, what the hell are you doing?&#34; she snapped, twisting against him until she finally wrenched herself free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Blue Lounge was shadowy and close, the corridor humming with bass and muffled voices.Brandon&#39;s face was tight with barely contained rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; he demanded, his voice pitched low but simmering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie cut him a look of pure dismissal and turned on her heel, intent on escaping, but he caught her wrist again. She jerked away, jaw clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why does it even matter to you?&#34; she retorted,eyes narrowed, putting deliberate distance between them.&#34;Don&#39;t you dare touch me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He echoed her words with a bitter, mocking laugh.&#34;You&#39;re seriously asking why it matters to me? Millie,you seem to forget your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met his sneer with icy composure. &#34;My place?You mean as your ex-wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s expression turned thunderous as he snapped,&#34;You!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head, smile unfazed. &#34;Oh, right-l nearly forgot. Did you and Vivian finally get married?bet she couldn&#39;t wait a second. If so, congrats on your big day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, rage choking off any reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of people swept past, pushing them off-balance for a heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bathed in the hazy lounge light, Millie&#39;s grin grew all the more striking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, Brandon said nothing. At last,he muttered, &#34;Seems you&#39;ve grown sharper since we last crossed paths.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a quiet laugh. &#34;Maybe you just never bothered to see who I really am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All these years, he&#39;d only cared about control-never once trying to understand her dreams, her feelings,or the stubborn streak in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time when she&#39;d given Brandon her heart without hesitation, ready to share every sunrise and secret for the rest of their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That devotion had vanished now-she&#39;d reclaimed every ounce of love, leaving nothing left for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever he was, whatever he felt, no longer mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brandon stared at her, words failing him, a quiet disappointment flickered across Millie&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t have the patience for him anymore.Spotting Charles weaving back through the crowd,two frosty beers in hand, she gave a quick wave and turned on her heel to meet him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of Millie moving toward Charles sent a fresh wave of fury through Brandon. He couldn&#39;t stand watching her laugh and dance with another man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, he seized her wrist and yanked her toward the stairs leading up to the private room Darden had reserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy burned in his chest, each heartbeat more erratic than the last. He couldn&#39;t stomach the thought of her being so carefree in another man&#39;s company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, let go! Do you hear me?&#34; Millie demanded,pounding her free hand against his arm. His hand only tightened around her wrist, his hold stubborn and unyielding as steel, making escape impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re hurting me.&#34; Millie gripped the railing, teeth bared, and bit down on his hand. Even then,Brandon&#39;s hold didn&#39;t budge-his gaze only grew colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie!&#34; Charles&#39; voice broke through the noise as he rushed over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him, Brandon carried Millie over his shoulder and muscled his way upstairs, ignoring her fists pounding against his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commotion outside the private room finally made Millie, seething, seized the moment to drive her heel into his leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon jerked, pain flashing across his face,and his arms fell away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She landed squarely on her feet, chest heaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s scowl deepened as he reached for her again, but in that instant, MAillie&#39;s sharp slap echoed through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her entire body shuddered, jaw clenched, knuckles white with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She despised this helplessness-the way he could overpower her so easily, the way he used brute force to impose his will. Rage simmered beneath her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia and Darden, alarmed by the confrontation,rushed over at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s left cheek reddened and began to swell,but his eyes only grew colder, a dark warning flickering in their depths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, if you ever touch me like that again, I&#39;ll call the police!&#34; Millie exclaimed, her voice icy and unwavering, brooking no argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heated exchange quickly drew a crowd as Seville and the escorts he&#39;d been dancing with stepped out of the private room, their curious eyes fixed on the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening out here?&#34; one of them asked,still trying to piece together the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s glare swept over the group, his expression fierce and menacing. He looked like he wanted to tear someone apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the fuck are these guys?&#34; he demanded, jaw clenched so tightly his words almost cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia, arms folded and attitude dialed up, shot back.&#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious? They&#39;re the gorgeous guys from the club, actually enjoying themselves with us tonight.You got a problem with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s scowl deepened, shadows darkening his face just as he drew a sharp breath to retort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Charles barreled onto the scene, two beers still in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by adrenaline and protectiveness, he didn&#39;t hesitate-he drove his foot straight into Brandon with a sharp kick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charles!&#34; Darden barked, stepping forward, clearly ready to break things up before it spiraled out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giffard reappeared from the hallway afterhis visit to the men&#39;s room, took in the tangled mess, and hurried forward to pry them apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amid the tangled voices and flying hands,a sudden crash snapped the crowd into complete silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads whipped toward the noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stood in the center, clutching a half-broken beer bottle, shards and froth exploding at her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough.&#34; Her voice rang out, cool and resolute. She shot a calm look at Alexia, her tone softening. &#34;Come on, Alexia. Let&#39;s go back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding her fingers around Alexia&#39;s, Millie guided her out of the haze, leading the way toward the private room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden started to speak, but Alexia jumped in,her tone dripping with mockery. &#34;Seriously? Is there anything more shameless than an ex-husband meddling in his ex-wife&#39;s life after the divorce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon tried to fire back, but Alexia didn&#39;t give him the chance. &#34;What the hell do you want to say now?Or are you finally embarrassed? Maybe you shouldn&#39;t have played around if you can&#39;t take the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s quick, biting comebacks left no room for rebuttal. &#34;Let&#39;s be real, Brandon. You&#39;re the one at fault here. Drop the victim act-it&#39;s pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville was already hustling the guys back into the private room, while Charles slipped some cash to the cleaning staff and, together with Giffard, steered Alexia and Millie away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a resounding bang, they slammed the door right in Brandon&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden reached for the handle, but the door refused to budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left standing in the dim hallway, Brandon&#39;s face had gone ghostly pale. His fists shook at his sides, and the bite mark Millie had left was still seeping blood, a stark reminder under the flickering light.</p>
