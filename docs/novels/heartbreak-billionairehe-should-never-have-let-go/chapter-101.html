                <p>Millie moved to slip past Brandon, but he blocked her path,holding firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught her wrist, his voice low. &#34;I know Babette provoked you with the Bennett family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of that name,Millie stopped in her tracks,her gaze steady and expectant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not joining that department,&#34; Brandon went on,hair tousled by the restless night wind. &#34;Whenever you&#39;re ready to come back, that position will still be waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie searched his face for some hint of sincerity, but her heart had long since closed that door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning to Brandon and the Watson Group was the last thing she wanted. She&#39;d had enough-of everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon held her gaze, trying to decipher her thoughts, but her expression gave nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind shifted, sending a swirl of dry leaves skittering across the dimly lit path between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And then?&#34; Millie pressed, her voice edged with impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And then?&#34; Brandon hesitated, his brows furrowing as he searched for the right words. &#34;Vivian just needed something from me,&#34; he finally said. &#34;She didn&#39;t go over there on purpose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie let out a sharp,incredulous laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, Babette had all but shoved her phone in Millie&#39;s face. One glance was enough-she&#39;d seen through their little scheme in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Brandon expected her to believe Vivian was innocent?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he really not know people, or did he just think she was that gullible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fed up,Millie wrenched her hand free from Brandon&#39;s grip and strode down the hallway,her heels clicking out her frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately stepped in front of her again, refusing to let her pass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stopped short, her patience snapping. &#34;Brandon,&#34;she bit out, pinning him with a glare. &#34;Ever since the night you brought up divorce, I haven&#39;t interfered in your life at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew in a shaky breath, fists balled at her sides.&#34;But you...&#34; Her voice rose, trembling with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the one who keeps parading your relationship with her around, turning it into a spectacle before our marriage is even over. Haven&#39;t you seen the headlines?Do you have any idea what people have been saying about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s brow was knotted in frustration, and his silence hung between them. Millie let out a soft,rueful laugh, and then turned her attention to a spider methodically spinning its web in the shadowy corner of the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand how much you care for her. You told me yourself-she&#39;s only got six months left,&#34; Millie noted,her voice low and even. &#34;So please, can I ask you to spend those months quietly by her side?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, holding his gaze for a heartbeat longer before adding, &#34;Just leave me alone. Stop dragging me into your mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted nothing to do with their tangled lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, Millie strode away, her steps brisk and final.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s hand twitched, tempted to stop her, but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to reach for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply watched as she walked toward the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doors slid shut, cutting her off from his sight- leaving him standing alone in the hallway, with nothing but silence for company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s words still reverberated in his head, each one cutting deeper than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d come to clear the air, but in the end, any explanation felt meaningless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as the truth about Vivian remained untold-and as long as Vivian was still alive-nothing he said could reach Millie now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands curled into tight fists,haunted by the fading sensation of Millie&#39;s touch, and a hollow certainty that she was slipping farther away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted his gaze, following where she&#39;d looked moments ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spider in the corner had finished spinning its web,poised right in the center, waiting in absolute stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon forced himself to let go, pushing down the ache inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally understood the anger burning in Millie&#39;s eyes tonight. For now, he would give her space-wait for a better chance, another day,to say what truly mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shut his eyes, drew in a slow breath, and fought to regain his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally looked up, his face had smoothed into a mask of calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon slipped into the driver&#39;s seat of the Maybach but left the engine off, motionless in the dim light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze drifted up, landing on the single lit window of Millie&#39;s apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want to leave-not tonight. If al he could do was sit there in silence, that would have to be enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs,Millie finished her bath and stretched out on the bed, her damp hair fanned across the pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw his presence lingering below through the window but stubbornly refused to let her thoughts wander to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,the night air slipped through the half-open window, carrying the faintest trace of gardenia</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And quietly, with neither of them moving, the long night slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometime during the night, a brief rain had swept through,leaving the street gleaming with moisture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, as Millie gazed out her window,she noticed the storm had passed and the Maybach was nowhere in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single dry rectangle stood out against the dark,rain -soaked pavement-a silent marker that the car had sheltered there until dawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,that was the end of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie drew in a slow breath, deciding right then to let the past drift away and focus on living well,come what may.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days blurred together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she knew it, the fourth round of the talent show Heavenly Melody had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty-seven days had already slipped by since she and Brandon filed for divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the recording studio, Brandon was already there,just as he had been for the previous three broadcasts.He occupied the exact same seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron, Jayceon, and Adriana showed up as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian offered them a polite greeting, but the trio from the Elliott family ignored her, their expressions frosty.When Vivian tried to approach, they simply brushed past, claiming seats as far away as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were seated, Adriana and Jayceon immediately launched into another one of teir endless squabbles, their sharp back-and-forth leaving no room for outsiders to chime in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shut out, Vivian had no choice but to turn her attention to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backstage in the dressing room, Millie had already finished preparing. This was the semi-final-tonight,half of the six contestants would be eliminated,leaving only the top three to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing quietly with her phone in hand, Millie reread the message Vivian had just sent to Serena&#39;s account.&#34;Tonight is your last chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her gaze, catching sight of Vivian chatting up Brandon, a saccharine smile plastered across Vivian&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since that bitter argument, Millie and Brandon hadn&#39;t exchanged a single word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon hadn&#39;t made any effort to approach Millie,and Millie, for her part, pretended he didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were nothing but strangers now-a clean break that made the prospect of signing the divorce papers in three days much simpler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles finished giving a few instructions, and then hesitated before weaving his way toward the audience to catch up with the Elliott siblings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elliott family hadn&#39;t even been involved with the show as one of its investors until just yesterday, when they swooped in at the last minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d missed their shot at a share of the profits, so they took a spot as advertisers instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More ad placements, whether in the live broadcast or the post-production edits, meant their brand would be everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elliott family&#39;s move wasn&#39;t exactly subtle. As one of the three powerhouses in Crobert, their grip on the gemstone and luxury goods market made their sponsorship instantly eye-catching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because it had all happened so abruptly, Charles wanted to get a read on their true intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After exchanging a few pleasantries, he turned to head backstage-but just as he passed Brandon&#39;s row,Brandon called him over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian had already slipped away to get ready,so Brandon sat alone, his gaze fixed and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles strode over, barely bothering to hide his disdain. &#34;Did you need something?&#34; he asked curtly,making no effort to sound friendly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon picked up on Charles&#39; hostile tone, his brows drawing together in a faint frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly is your relationship with Millie?&#34; His stare was sharp, relentless, searching Charles&#39; face for any flicker of truth. &#34;And Serena? What&#39;s really going on between you two?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles nearly laughed out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to snap, &#34;None of your damn business,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but reined himself in and forced his temper down.&#34;That&#39;s not something you need to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie is my wife,&#34; Brandon declared, the words landing with deliberate force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles let out a short, incredulous breath. He couldn&#39;t hold back anymore. He glanced over at Vivian, still visible across the room, and jabbed a finger in her direction. &#34;Then who&#39;s that supposed to be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone dripped with sarcasm, the mock surprise doing nothing to hide his scorn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for all the cameras nearby, Charles would&#39;ve openly rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How the hell did Brandon have the guts to say that to him?</p>
