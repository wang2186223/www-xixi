                <p>Brandon strode in at that very moment. Egbert&#39;s assistant followed close behind, the newly-printed contract in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving himself a second thought, Brandon plunged straight into the cold depths of the pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With quick hands, he pulled Millie from the freezing water.</p>

                <p>Everyone in the room stood frozen. The shock and fear were plain on every face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, the calm of Serenity Villa&#39;s bedroom offered a sharp contrast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert looked at Brandon and said, &#34;You want to know what went down after you left? Now you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A row of empty bottles hinted at how much Egbert had been drinking, and there was a glazed look in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising his head, Egbert fixed his gaze on Brandon, who seemed close to breaking down, his eyes rimmed with red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter laugh escaped Egbert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe me, it&#39;s not a complicated storsaid Egbert, furrowing his brow. The sunlight pouring through the window set his eyes aglow with a strange,red light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She put her trust in you, loved you more than you know, and risked everything for your sake. Does any of that mean anything to you?&#34; asked Egbert. The wind lifted his hair as he continued,&#34;After you saved her from the water that day, the first thing she did was to remind me to sign the contract. She truly cared about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden crash shattered the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next instant, Brandon launched himself from the bed, grabbed Egbert by the collar, and drove him hard into the white wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glasses and bottles went tumbling, red wine pooling across the floor like spilled blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That dark stain brought back the memory of Millie&#39;s endless bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Echoes of her laughter and the sound of her broken sobs lingered in their thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s face twisted with pain, and tears threatened to spill from his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Egbert&#39;s only response was a sharp, mocking laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert leaned forward and said, &#34;She got that clever edge from her father. Maybe she learned it, or maybe it&#39;s just in her blood. She&#39;s sharp and strong-willed. When it comes to herself, she doesn&#39;t hold back. You should know that by now.&#34; He shook his head. &#34;She planned everything, except for the baby. That surprised us all. From the very start, she decided her own safety didn&#39;t matter. She knew I&#39;d likely rip up the contract,so she didn&#39;t wait. She proposed a wager first. I set the rules, but she never let go of control. Deep down,she knew even if she won, I would not keep my promise, so she kept pushing until I could not think straight.We risked everything that day. I bet she noticed the pool the moment I pressed my gun against her head.She made that choice. For her, a chance in the water was better than a bullet from me.&#34;⑤</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Brandon had been there for everything, he understood exactly what Egbert meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie had begun weaving her plan the instant Egbert started making threats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every word she spoke, she&#39;d already decided she&#39;d put everything on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still, nobody knew she was carrying your child then. Not you. Not her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; Brandon could not hold back anymore. He swung and hit Egbert hard on the jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert didn&#39;t back down. He swung right back, his fist connecting with Brandon&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men crashed into each other, trading blows with raw fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the commotion brought people running, and soon, hands were grabbing at their arms, pulling them apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egbert wiped the blood from his mouth and spat on the floor. &#34;Youhave no right to be mad here! While you stand there, remember this-she would&#39;ve died for you without a second thought. She might plan every move, but my gun was loaded and pointed straight at her head. And what do you do now? Treat her like she&#39;s nothing, all because of another woman? You&#39;re the one who failed her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s face twisted in pain, words dying on his lips. Instead, he shut his eyes and let the guilt wash over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myron has her now,&#34; Brandon said, his tone heavy with sorrow.&#34;She walked away from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You got what was coming to you.&#34; Egbert rolled his eyes and then stalked out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone, Brandon watched in silence as the maid hurried to pick up the shattered glass and mop up the mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That dark puddle of red wine clung to the floor, so much like blood that Brandon had to turn away, stung by the memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..·</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, Brandon made his entrance at the Watson Group headquarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking refreshed and healthy, he brushed off concern, telling colleagues that a simple illness had kept him away,but he was already back on his feet.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers and speculation faded soon after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When pressed by eager journalists about Millie&#39;s recent statement to the public, Brandon simply shut down,giving them nothing to work with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days slipped by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within the city&#39;s elite circles, Vivian stayed in the spotlight, hyping up her debut luxury floral showcase through a livestream event at an elegant villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For maximum impact, she timed her livestream to clash with the launch of Elliott Group&#39;s newest series-turning the day into a silent rivalry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darden had lent his villa to Vivian for her project as Brandon asked. However, Vivian frowned at the option. It just didn&#39;t have the wow factor she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The opening needed to dazzle, so finding the perfect venue became her obsession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of mischief flickered in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Millie threw herself into final preparations for the Elliott Group&#39;s upcoming event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This latest collection focused on brilliant yellow gemstones, aptly named the Golden series.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In recent weeks, Millie had juggled between work and Ari&#39;s care, grateful for Myron&#39;s unwavering support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With so much time spent together, a quiet bond formed between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they dropped Ari off that evening, Millie and Myron wandered through familiar streets side by side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night after night, they&#39;d found comfort in this samewalk, letting routine knit them closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their fingers intertwined, the two watched their shadows stretch and merge beneath the moon&#39;s soft glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Conversation flowed easily, and soon talk circled back to the product launch and everything that could go wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the walk ended, Myron made sure Millie reached her door safely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing at her doorstep, he remarked gently, &#34;The launch is almost here, Millie. Vivian&#39;s not the type to back down.Just promise you&#39;ll stay alert.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Millie gave a nod of agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had barely stepped inside when Myron interjected with a soft laugh, &#34;Hold on, Millie. Don&#39;t go in just yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Confusion flashed across Millie&#39;s face as she glanced up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could say another word, Myron swept in, wrapped an arm around her, gently held her cheek,and pressed a kiss to her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron grinned and said, &#34;That&#39;s your goodnight kiss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s cheeks turned pink as she playfully tapped his shoulder. She laughed, unable to help herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled even wider. &#34;Now I can wish you a real good night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You too, Myron.&#34; She slipped inside, the smile still on her face as she closed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron smiled as he stood there, charmed by her bashful look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Millie leaned against the cool wood, fingers brushing her lips. Her heart hammered, and her blush deepened as she replayed that kiss in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far away, the darkness of a neighboring building concealed a silent observer.O</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hidden in shadow, Brandon caught a glimpse of their kiss before he looked away, unable to bear another second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized his hands were shaking as he walked back to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resting in his drawer, the wedding ring he once put on Millie&#39;s finger himself now waited in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint vibration disrupted the silence as his phone lit up with a new message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After checking the screen, Brandon let out a slow sigh and responded, &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll head out to Proidan in a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When dawn broke on the morning of the launch of Elliott Group&#39;s Golden series, Brandon boarded a plane.His flight took him straight to Proidan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing at a window, Vivian watched his departure with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even fate&#39;s on my side,&#34; Vivian muttered to herself, a sly glint sparking in her eyes.</p>
