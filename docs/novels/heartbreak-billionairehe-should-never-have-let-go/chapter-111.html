                <p>Brandon closed his eyes, the weight in his chest tightening. It took several long seconds for him to swallow the ache and speak up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ari,&#34; he said quietly, &#34;things between Vivian and me..they&#39;re not what you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ari just looked at him with those large, searching eyes, making his heart sink further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know how to explain it to you since it&#39;s too complicated,&#34; he said, voice softer now. &#34;But one day,you&#39;ll understand. Both of you and your mom will.There&#39;s a pretty tanzanite in the safe at home-your mother liked it a lot. I&#39;ll have a jeweler design something beautiful from it, just for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Ari replied. &#34;I&#39;m my mother&#39;s daughter. You&#39;re not my father. I don&#39;t want jewelry or anything from you. You don&#39;t need to show me how rich you are.I already know. But I love my mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not yet five, but her words cut with clarity and purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slid down from the chair,clutching her plushie.Its soft ears flapped with the motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t come see me again,&#34; she said, turning away. &#34;I need to go back to sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stood, but he didn&#39;t follow. Instead, he called out, &#34;Just this once-please accept the gifts. They were chosen with you in mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari paused and turned back slightly, her lips pressed tight. &#34;Sir, I told you. You can give them to someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ll be yours. Once you have them, you can do whatever you want,&#34; Brandon said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| already said,&#34; Ari insisted. &#34;They belong to you.1don&#39;t want them. Are you trying to force a child,sir?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon let out a quiet sigh. &#34;That&#39;s not what I mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He only wanted to be kind to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ari didn&#39;t say anything else. She just looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The director of the facility, who had been standing quietly by the doorway, stepped in. Her eyes were disapproving as she looked at Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the staff members came forward to guide Ari back to her room, while the director lingered. She stared as Brandon watched Ari go, his lips drawn in a tight line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should head back, Mr. Watson,&#34; the director said.&#34;We&#39;ll look after her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon didn&#39;t answer right away. He lowered his head slightly, letting his fringe fall across his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then reached into his coat and pulled out a checkbook, scribbled something quickly, and handed the check to the director.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A donation,&#34; he said. &#34;For the children here. Use it how you see fit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The director hesitated but then accepted it. Despite her opinion of Brandon, the money was much needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These other things...&#34; Brandon gestured toward the untouched gift bags. &#34;See if any of the children can use them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The director nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t tell them who it came from,&#34; Brandon added.&#34;And keep her safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The director nodded again.&#34;We will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m leaving,&#34; Brandon murmured-not to anyone in particular. He then turned and walked off into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The city spun on,loud and fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was racing toward Evans Mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had multiple phones stuffed into his coat. One had a video call still running with Millie and the team,another was pulling updates from the mansion, and everything else was vibrating constantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head was starting to throb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several investors from the show were already on their way. Millie had come up with a smart solution,but the real trouble wasn&#39;t those investors. It was his brothers.Both of them had made it there first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Evans family, Charles was finally starting to gain ground. But his two brothers weren&#39;t going to hand over control without a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, seeing Millie and the others on the video call-shuffling papers, tracking updates, coordinating their plan-it grounded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to stay strong and win this. No matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was his one shot to flip the script-something Millie had made possible. If he failed now, he&#39;d stay the underdog forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned forward, urging the driver to speed up,too focused to notice the car that slipped past them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Millie and her team were deep in paperwork,sorting through document after document.After what felt like endless hours, they finally confirmed everything they needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did the tension in the room ease slightly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie checked the time. 3 a.m.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you all so much,&#34; she said, her voice warm with gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No trouble at all,&#34; Seville replied with a relaxed smile.&#34;This is what we&#39;re here for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t entirely out of kindness-Charles had already recognized his skills and brought him into Evans Entertainment with a generous offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But since the whole situation was still in a delicate phase, that news hadn&#39;t been made public yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia had received her reward from Charles too. She was now curled up on the couch, hugging her brand-new Prada handbag from the latest collection,grinning. &#34;I got my bag. Doing some work in return?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s totally fair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Millie knew the difference between helping because it was your job and helping because you cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville was a seasoned collector of action figures-lots of them were even rare,limited editions. Alexia?She was the daughter of Crobert Hospital&#39;s director.Neither of them had financial problems. They had poured their time and energy into this for Millie simnply because they cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t say anything more. But she made a quiet note in her heart to treat them sincerely in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millie, what&#39;s next?&#34; Alexia asked, mid-yawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seville listened in as he placed a late-night snack order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie didn&#39;t look away from the screen. &#34;Vivian&#39;s own tactics can be used to push back against her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t follow,&#34; Alexia said, slumping deeper into the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie stopped typing for a second, glanced up, and smiled. &#34;A show that inspires people and conveys a positive,uplifting message won&#39;t be shut down, right?And Vivian&#39;s public image is all about being brave and inspiring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia blinked,still puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie handed her a pillow to lean on and continued,&#34;She&#39;s the one who said she wants the public to see the last months of her life to encourage those who suffer just like her. That makes her sound generous,doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So we&#39;re using her own message to respond?&#34; Alexia mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their concern now wasn&#39;t just the donation fraud scandal-it was the risk of the wwhole program being shut down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But most cancellations only happened when the negative impact was clear and immediate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heavenly Melody had launched on the strength of Vivian&#39;s appeal, and the audience had only shifted focus much later to talk about the talent, the competition, the music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And up until now, Serena hadn&#39;t had a single public scandal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even this supposed scandal was murky. There was no confirmation yet. Those higher-ups in charge knew how this industry worked-nothing was ever as simple as it looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the show&#39;s overall message being hopeful and socially positive, canceling it outright wouldn&#39;t be their first option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their research had also shown that in similar situations,the common solution was to quietly edit out the controversial individuals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, the authorities wouldn&#39;t make a snap decision.There would be meetings, discussions, protocol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with their document submission, they had officially flagged their interest in an internal investigation-and requested a final deadline before the last livestream aired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The decision-makers would want proper evidence,which bought them precious, much-needed time to handle things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it gets too bad, I&#39;ll just reveal my identity,&#34; Millie said, hitting the Enter key to send a file to Charles.&#34;But I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have to go that far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other matters were being taken care of by staff at Evans Entertainment, who were now liaising directly with the right departments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The delay strategy was now mostly set.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that was left... was to finalize her divorce from Brandon.</p>
