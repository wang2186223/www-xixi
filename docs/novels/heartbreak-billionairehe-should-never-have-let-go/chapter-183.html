                <p>Back in those days, Vivian had proclaimed with unwavering determination that &#34;Glimmer of Love&#34;represented her deepest reflections on existence and mortality, her heartfelt tribute to Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The song even faced off against &#34;Yesterday,&#34;performed by both Serena and Millie, creating a golden marketing battleground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the moment arrived, Vivian could manipulate public sentiment by crushing Millie through her own promotional campaigns, transforming her personal tragedy into commercial gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond the marketing advantage, audiences believed she had crafted this masterpiece independently,earning their respect far more easily than her previous collaborations that seemed to lean heavily on Brandon&#39;s influence. She intended to cultivate her image as a self-reliant artist, seizing this golden opportunity to systematically destroy Millie&#39;s reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to win, and no other composition or venture could deliver such devastating results.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to allow this golden opportunity to escape her grasp!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon, I understand that Charles will stand behind Millie,&#34; Vivian declared,her voice carrying calculated certainty. &#34;But Eva holds the ultimate power in this decision. We simply need to secure Eva&#39;s allegiance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Eva...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s lips curved into a contemptuous smile as she dismissed the woman as nothing more than a pretentious fraud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eva had initially rejected their offer to purchase the song, yet when the monetary offer reached her satisfaction threshold, she surrendered it willingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This mercenary behavior had eliminated Vivian&#39;s fears from the very beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consider this scenario: Evans Entertainment maintained that Eva had composed the song, but Eva herself contradicted this claim, insisting that Vivian had written it, declaring that Charles had woven lies to benefit Millie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which version would the public embrace?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While celebrities maintained contractual obligations with their agencies, many decisions remained within  their personal control, which gave them the opportunity to turn Eva against her company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such conflicts between celebrities and their agencies could spiral into complex legal nightmares, potentially stretching across countless years of bitter litigation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furthermore, Eva&#39;s insatiable greed for money meant that with sufficient financial incentive, she would dance to whatever tune they played.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if, years down the road, Evans Entertainment somehow managed to pursue legal action against Vivian,she would have already secured her position as Brandon&#39;s wife by then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, she kept these calculating thoughts buried deep within her mind. Instead, she gazed at him with tears glistening in her eyes. &#34;Brandon, I acknowledge my mistake regarding the song&#39;s ownership. My emotions clouded my judgment completely back then.Please grant me one more opportunity, won&#39;t you?Let&#39;s approach Eva together and make proper amends.If we can negotiate a fair settlement with her, then no injustice will remain. Should this attempt fail, we&#39;ll abandon our plans entirely and try someone new as you suggested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon studied Vivian&#39;s face with growing unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had she transformed into someone so utterly devoid of moral boundaries?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian shrank back under the weight of his penetrating stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Brandon simply averted his piercing gaze,his expression hardening with resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A conversation with Eva had become unavoidable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was championing Millie&#39;s cause, which meant that at the crucial moment, the question of the song&#39;s true authorship would inevitably surface, and Brandon understood he needed to seal this dangerous crack before it widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s sharp, accusatory gaze haunted his memories,refusing to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victory was his only acceptable outcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles questioned the foundation of Millie&#39;s unwavering confidence in her predictions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, they were all carefully groomed heirs of distinguished family dynasties who had been meticulously shaped and molded since their earliest childhood years to inherit vast empires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When someone truly lacked the necessary skills,they were typically assigned to domestic responsibilities,such as bearing heirs, much like his own father, who devoted his existence to pursuing beautiful women and continuously expanding his lineage through countless romantic conquests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Competent successors instinctively grasped the critical importance of managing potential disasters before they struck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Brandon&#39;s track record spoke volumes about his abilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though they all considered Brandon utterly reprehensible in matters of romantic relationships,he had successfully guided Watson Group to achieve dominance over Crobert&#39;s three most powerful corporate entities. Aside from this recent misjudgment involving Vivian, his leadership had proven consistently exemplary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Therefore, he shouldn&#39;t possess such profound blindness as to venture this far into treacherous territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, before Charles could delve deeper into his mounting suspicions, his phone erupted with an urgent call from the company headquarters, informing him that representatives from Watson Group demanded a meeting the following day and insisted that Eva&#39;s presence was absolutely non-negotiable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles felt his composure shatter beneath the weight of this unexpected development.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately contacted Millie to share this startling information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie was with Ari during that precise moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After absorbing the news, she offered only a brief acknowledgment of understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must confess, you truly comprehend his psychological patterns with remarkable precision,&#34;Charles muttered through the phone&#39;s speaker, his voice tinged with reluctant admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie kept staring at her phone&#39;s screen even after she hung up, as the motionless interface reflected her contemplative expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She genuinely understood Brandon&#39;s methods with frightening accuracy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven grueling years saturated with countless moments of life-and-death interdependence had forged an unbreakable understanding between them -how could such intimate knowledge simply evaporate into nothingness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, the reality of the situation might not align perfectly with Charles&#39; confident assumptions and carefully constructed theories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t that Brandon remained ignorant of fundamental risk control principles; instead, he was desperately searching for ways to repair the devastating damage after the fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, Vivian&#39;s blinding influence had completely clouded his judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he perceived as a thoughtful remedy and strategic solution, Vivian interpreted through an entirely different lens that served her own twisted agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clasping Ari&#39;s small hand firmly in hers, Millie emerged from the school grounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They exchanged delightful stories about Ari&#39;s entertaining adventures at kindergarten throughout the day. As they approached the familiar street corner,a recognizable vehicle caught their attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myron positioned himself beside the sleek vehicle,his warm smile radiating genuine pleasure as he welcomed them both, carefully cradling a specialized pet carrier that housed his beloved plush feline companion, which responded to their approach with an endearing &#34;meow&#34; that seemed perfectly timed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari&#39;s eyes immediately transformed into brilliant pools of wonder and delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie discovered Ari&#39;s enthusiastic reaction utterly charming and endearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During previous encounters, Myron had attempted to capture Millie&#39;s affections through this same charming feline strategy; while she had remained completely unmoved, Ari had fallen completely under the cat&#39;s irresistible spell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They approached the car with eager steps and settled comfortably into the luxurious interior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were safely inside, Myron carefully released the cat from its temporary confinement, and the intelligent creature, fully aware of its enchanting purpose, rolled onto its back in invitation for gentle strokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Positioned on the vehicle&#39;s rear bench sat an enormous, impossibly soft plush toy that doubled as the most luxurious cushion imaginable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari cast a questioning glance toward Millie, who responded with an encouraging nod of approval,prompting Ari to naturally gravitate toward the cat and embrace it with tender affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie found herself genuinely amazed by the seamless interaction unfolding before her eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve encountered this little one a handful of times</p>
                
                
                
                <p>already. Yet we never got to ask about its name,&#34;Millie said to Myron with genuine amusement dancing in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Its name is Kiki, though Jayceon had originally lobbied for the name Fatty, but | believed Kiki possessed far more elegant appeal,&#34; Myron explained with obvious fondness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s smile blossomed as she nodded her wholehearted agreement with his choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The small group ventured out together to share an evening meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie couldn&#39;t suppress her growing amusement at their evolving pattern; they had originally agreed to meet just once each week, yet now their encounters seemed to occur with daily frequency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is just a casual night out with Ari; but I have developed elaborate plans for our weekly rendezvous,&#34;Myron declared, directing his knowing smile directly at her. &#34;That&#39;ll be our date night, and I intend to surprise you beyond your expectations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie studied his expression with growing curiosity before offering a thoughtful nod of acknowledgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found herself genuinely beginning to look forward to whatever he had planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the harmonious trio savored their pleasant evening together, Brandon and Vivian&#39;s dinner unfolded under a suffocating cloud of unmistakable tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly afterward, Brandon escorted Vivian back to her residence before proceeding to Blue Lounge,honoring Darden&#39;s invitation that he had accepted earlier in the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, Darden had deliberately/ chosen not to invite any additional company; the evening belonged exclusively to the two of them and their shared solitude over drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dance floor below them pulsed with vibrant energy, filled with countless people moving rhythmically to the hypnotic, pounding music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the two men consumed their alcohol in heavy,oppressive silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men carried the heavy burden of their respective troubles, weighing down their spirits like anchors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After draining their glasses completely,they departed without ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This marked their first encounter with absolutely zero  dialogue exchanged between them, nothing but methodical drinking to fill the hollow space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the journey back to his residence, the driver navigated the streets while Brandon slouched in the rear seat, his entire body radiating profound discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never before experienced such overwhelming despair and emptiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He questioned whether perhaps he hadn&#39;t consumed sufficient alcohol to numb his pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consequently, he instructed the driver to halt the vehicle and ventured into a nearby convenience store to purchase additional bottles of liquor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From within the brightly lit store emerged the harsh sounds of a couple engaged in a heated, acrimonious argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t assume I&#39;m some pathetic coward like that spineless Millie! If you have the audacity to flirt with others again, I&#39;ll slice it clean off! Let&#39;s see exactly how you manage to charm anyone without your precious &#39;equipment&#39;!&#34; a woman&#39;s voice shrieked with unmistakable venom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you behave in such a manner, completely abandoning any trace of feminine gentleness,&#34; the man shot back with defensive indignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go straight to hell! Screw your ridiculous gentleness!Let me make this crystal clear-I am naturally fierce and uncompromising in this exact manner; sotell me what you&#39;re going to do about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heated argument continued its destructive course while Brandon slowly lowered his gaze, focusing intently on the bottles of alcohol cradled within his trembling hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, he silently gathered his purchases and approached the self-checkout machine to complete his transaction in solitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the store&#39;s entrance, a gleaming Bentley glided past,carrying the joyfully laughing Millie,Myron,and Ari within its luxurious interior, their happiness completely unnoticed by the brooding Brandon.</p>
